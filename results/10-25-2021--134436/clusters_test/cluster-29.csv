"Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing as a Novel Approach for Linking Prebiotics with Active Gut Microbiota PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Characterization of the metabolic interactions between organisms is key to understanding the mechanisms of disease and symbioses between microbes and their animal hosts. Our long-term goal is to advance the applicability and accessibility of proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) in ways that make it a valuable tool for microbiome researchers looking to measure in situ metabolic interactions of human microbiota. The objective of this proposal is to improve the performance and reproducibility of experimental measurements and accelerate the computational analysis of proteomic SIP experiments and to demonstrate the value of this method for studying the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of prebiotics by gut microbiota. Expected outcomes will represent a significant advance, because optimizing the use of prebiotics as therapeutics requires identification of the specific microorganisms capable of metabolizing prebiotics. By identifying proteins of specific taxa that are synthesized as a direct result of prebiotic assimilation, proteomic SIP will provide unambiguous links between prebiotic metabolism and the specific microorganisms responsible for this activity. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to increase the performance and reproducibility of mass spectrometry measurements by optimizing data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteomic SIP; 2) to significantly accelerate the computing-intensive database search step by adapting the Sipros algorithm to use graphic processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing; and 3) to track in vivo and in vitro prebiotic assimilation patterns by microbial populations within simple consortia and complex natural communities. Our proposed work includes several innovations, such as the application of deep learning algorithms to improve the analysis mass spectrometry data, leveraging GPU-based parallel computing and cloud computing to accelerate the computational steps in the data analysis workflow, and using proteomic SIP for the first time to track prebiotic metabolism by gut microbes. The expected outcomes of the project include (a) a new DIA- based workflow for proteomic SIP that can identify significantly more labeled peptides at higher accuracy of enrichment estimation, (b) a new computational workflow that is faster to run, more scalable to large datasets, and more accessible to researchers, and (c) establish novel foundational knowledge on the specificity of prebiotic metabolism by microbes in the gut. These outcomes will establish proteomic SIP as a valuable -omics tool that will complement existing approaches to study the metabolism of gut microbiota, and specifically highlight its ability to investigate metabolism of prebiotics and probiotics as they relate to treating microbial dysbiosis and nutrition-related diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prebiotics is a potential treatment for dysbiosis in human gut microbiota, which plays a role in many diseases, including diabetes and obesity. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we will develop and demonstrate the proteomic stable isotope probing approach for characterization of the metabolism of prebiotics by gut microorganisms.",Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing as a Novel Approach for Linking Prebiotics with Active Gut Microbiota,10276744,R01AT011618,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Assimilations', 'Bioinformatics', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Cloud Computing', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Inulin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nutrition Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Running', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'carbon fiber', 'complex data', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data standards', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dysbiosis', 'experimental study', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hemicellulose', 'high throughput technology', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'maltodextrin', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metaproteomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'parallel computer', 'prebiotics', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'searchable database', 'stable isotope', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,60860
"Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer Project Summary/Abstract This proposal requests funding for a Bruker rapifleX matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of- flight/time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) instrument to be placed in the MS Facility in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The rapifleX will replace a 2008 Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI TOF/TOF for high resolution and MS/MS analysis of biomacromolecules. This is an essential capability for the user community of NIH-funded chemical biology researchers at UPenn synthesizing modified peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides. The rapifleX is not merely a replacement for the UltrafleX III, its improved resolution and MS/MS capabilities will permit analysis of complex PTMs or cross-links that are challenging on current MALDI and electrospray ionization systems at UPenn. Furthermore, the rapifleX provides new capabilities not currently found in any MS system at UPenn, allowing users to conceive of new areas of research. Ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) analysis and MALDI MS imaging (MSI) will take biomedical research at UPenn in new directions. The uHTS capabilities will enable experiments to characterize enzyme and small molecule reactions, including monitoring the kinetics of post-translational modifications on authentic peptide and protein substrates and machine-learning enhanced experiments exploring combinatorial effects of reagents and additives in reactions (in collaboration with the High Throughput Experimentation Center and Merck developers of uHTS experiments). Most significantly, the rapifleX will bring the exciting capability of MSI to UPenn. Among the projects included in this application are those that use state-of-the-art imaging methods with the rapifleX to address important research questions in areas such as cancer, viral and bacterial infections, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, or diabetes and obesity. Also included is a project that pushes beyond the state-of-the-art to develop new MSI technologies using the rapifleX that will vastly increase the information content from targeted imaging. The addition of the rapifleX will have an immediate and lasting impact on more than 20 highly active investigators and more than 200 trainees carrying out research that spans nine institutes of the NIH. This includes chemical biology, biophysics, organic chemistry, neuroscience, and translational research programs, as well as NIH T32-funded trainees. The rapifleX will also significantly benefit NIH-funded research programs in schools across UPenn, including the Perelman School of Medicine, School of Engineering and Applied Science, and School of Veterinary Medicine, as well as at neighboring institutions such as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Drexel University, and Thomas Jefferson University. The rapifleX will be a key instrument in a broad overhaul of the UPenn Chemistry MS Facility, making it a center of excellence for the region. Narrative A proposed mass spectrometry (MS) instrument will add new, state-of-the-art capabilities, such as MS imaging of biological tissues, to the MS Facility in the Chemistry Department at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). More than 20 faculty research groups (encompassing more than 200 researchers) in the Chemistry Department, in other UPenn departments, and at neighboring institutions, will benefit from access to this instrument, leading to MS-enabled breakthroughs in NIH-funded projects of relevance to cancer, viral and bacterial infections, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and obesity, among other disorders.",Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer,10177330,S10OD030460,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Funding', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obesity', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peptides', 'Philadelphia', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Schools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'System', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Virus Diseases', 'biomacromolecule', 'combinatorial', 'crosslink', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mass spectrometer', 'medical schools', 'programs', 'small molecule', 'targeted imaging', 'translational research program']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,S10,2021,881297
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait speed', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protons', 'Proxy', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soleus Muscle', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Water', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'carbene', 'clinical biomarkers', 'design', 'falls', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'sarcopenia', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'therapy development']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480
"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10470610,R01HD101560,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Endometrial', 'Endometrium', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Laparoscopy', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'eutopic endometrium', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in situ imaging', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ionization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient subsets', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'reproductive', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'subfertility', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,234220
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR PROTEOFORM IDENTIFICATION BY TOP-DOWNDATA INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY Summary Mass spectrometry-based top-down proteomics has become one of the most informative approaches in protein analysis because it provides the bird's-eye view of intact proteoforms (protein forms) generated from post-translational modifications and sequence variations. Data dependent acquisition and data independent acquisition are the two main methods in top-down mass spectrometry. The former has been the dominant one, but it has two main challenges in proteome-wide studies: low protein coverage: a regular experiment of human cells can identify only 200 – 400 proteins, and low reproducibility: a technical triplet shares only about one third of identified proteoforms. Top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (TD-DIA-MS) has the potential to significantly increase protein coverage and improve reproducibility in proteome-wide studies. However, its application has been hampered by the complexity of the data and the lack of efficient software tools. To address this problem, we will propose new algorithms and machine learning models and develop the first software package for proteoform identification by TD-DIA-MS. The proposed research will be conducted by a group of researchers with complementary expertise. All the proposed algorithms will be implemented as user-friendly open source software tools. Narrative This project addresses the proteoform identification problem by top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We will propose new machine learning models and new algorithms for high-throughput proteome-wide identification of complex proteoforms with post-translational modifications and sequence variations by using top- down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry. The proposed methods will facilitate the study of the function of complex proteoforms and the discovery of proteome biomarkers.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR PROTEOFORM IDENTIFICATION BY TOP-DOWNDATA INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY,10232121,R01GM118470,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Human', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Peptides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data complexity', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'insulinoma', 'migration', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'signature molecule', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,287090
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine.

"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture. We propose to develop an HPLC-EED- MS/MS method for comprehensive glycome characterization.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,10231176,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microbial composition', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,589506
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others.

"Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production Project summary Thrombin is a critical element of the hemostatic/thrombotic response, as evidenced by the large number of clinically relevant pro- and anti-coagulant therapies designed to regulate its generation or activity. Thrombin regulation is not a purely biochemical matter, but rather it emerges from the interaction of the biochemical cascade with the evolving physical microenvironment (i.e., platelet deposition). As such, in order to determine how reaction rates of the coagulation cascade may be impacted inside of a hemostatic (or thrombotic) mass we need to study the tightly-woven interaction between the biochemical reactions responsible for thrombin generation and the physical environment in which they occur. Our primary objective is to answer a fundamental question: can the narrow pores of a hemostatic mass operate as a ‘molecular barrier’ and terminate thrombin generation? If so, this would represent an understudied mechanism mediated by platelets and/or fibrin, and the structure they form following accumulation, at a site of injury. The hypothesized molecular barrier results from the hindered movement of soluble species through the evolving hemostatic mass microenvironment. Hemostatic masses are defined by a complex network of mesoscopic scale pores with dimensions of a few to tens of nanometers, and as a result, biochemical reactions relevant to clotting occur in extremely confined spaces. Previous studies explored the idea that the physical environment of a hemostatic plug may contribute to regulating the hemostatic response, but an accurate knowledge of the microstructure of a hemostatic mass remains elusive. Our proposed studies will address this bottleneck by combining novel volume imaging electron microscopy methods of hemostatic masses with artificial intelligence methods to create anatomically realistic domains for simulations of coagulation biochemistry. In Aim #1, in collaboration with Dr. Weisel (letter attached), we will acquire sequential image stacks of hemostatic masses formed in vivo using correlative multi-photon fluorescence and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron microscopy. In Aim #2, we employ artificial intelligence methods to perform accurate image-driven 3D reconstruction of hemostatic mass microarchitectures, using the image stacks generated in Aim #1. As part of a related research project, we have already acquired an initial set of transmission electron microscopy images of hemostatic thrombi at single-platelet resolution to guide our initial computational efforts. In Aim #3, we will use the reconstructions obtained to examine how the hemostatic mass microarchitecture impedes molecular transport. We will evolve simulations to systematically evaluate how pore size and molecule size interact to regulate molecular diffusion. Finally, we will ask whether limitations in molecular transport through the hemostatic mass are responsible for the termination of thrombin production at a local level. If confirmed, this mechanism will represent a fundamental shift in the way we understand the role of platelet activation and accumulation, the hallmarks of hemostasis and thrombosis. Project Narrative The coagulation biochemical cascade and platelets work together as part of the normal response to vascular injury, called hemostasis, producing a plug that limits blood loss. By contrast, an improper hemostatic response results in numerous clinical problems, including excessive bleeding (e.g., hemophilia), or vascular occlusion that damages tissues such as the heart and brain (i.e., heart attacks and strokes). The goal of this project is to understand if the biochemical reactions of the coagulation cascade are regulated by the architecture of the hemostatic plug, and then translate that understanding into improved methods to treat disorders of the hemostatic system.",Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production,10218337,R21HL153946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coagulants', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Confined Spaces', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Fibrin', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic Disorders', 'Hemostatic function', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Pathologic', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physical environment', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of jugular vein', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Thrombin', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Transport Process', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-photon', 'nanometer', 'nanometer resolution', 'novel', 'particle', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'reaction rate', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapy design', 'thrombotic', 'vascular injury']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,236604
"A Proteogenomic Search Engine for Direct Mass Spectrometric Identification of Variant Proteins Using Genomic Data Project Summary / Abstract Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, used in conjunction with genomics, has been called proteogenomics. Recent exponential increases in variant identification by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is redefining the concept of the human genome/proteome. Our project is the commercialization of a first-to-market proteomic database search engine for mass spectrometry capable of directly reading NGS data for the identification of mutilations from individual samples or from curated resources. Such an offering has the potential to bring together these two fields, enabling validation of mutations at the protein-level. Mutated proteins have been shown to make ideal targets for drug therapies and diagnostics in cancer. Our software will provide an intuitive user experience, approachable by scientists who may not be expert both proteomic and genomic data analysis. Since the search engine is guided by prior knowledge, performance exceeds current practice. The software will come complete with a full array of post-processing validation, and visualization tools. Project Narrative The detection of protein variants, which differ from those predicted from the reference human genome sequence, can make ideal candidates for the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics for many clinical conditions such as cancer.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV- related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death. We propose to develop a new mass spectrometry imaging pipeline that will enable mapping of biomolecules in in biological tissues at high spatial resolution. This will provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology.",Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver,10261546,UG3CA256962,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiolipins', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Environment', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Freezing', 'Gases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Protein Fragment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Visualization', 'Water', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cryogenics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'high resolution imaging', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'ionization', 'ionization technique', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'preservation', 'protein complex', 'reconstruction', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,UG3,2021,300000
