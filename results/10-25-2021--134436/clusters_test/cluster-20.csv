"Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania 1 Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence  2 and prevalence are increasing in this age group. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance  3 strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Electronic health  4 record (EHR)-based surveillance is a relatively simple, sustainable, and timely alternative to more traditional  5 methods. Recognizing the attributes of EHR-based surveillance, the Centers for Disease Control and  6 Prevention (CDC) has funded efforts to develop, evaluate, and deploy EHR-based surveillance of diabetes,  7 including the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study and the Diabetes in Young Adults (DiYA) Study.  8 However, the geographic coverage of these studies has been limited. The geographical gaps in these studies  9 are problematic, as there are known geographic disparities in diabetes prevalence and incidence. Moreover, 10 little is known about how the methods applied in these studies will perform in other regions of the country, in 11 rural communities, and in other health systems. The proposed study will use more than two decades of EHR 12 data and administrative claims data to develop and implement EHR-based surveillance of type 1 and type 2 13 diabetes among young adults in a large region of Pennsylvania, the state with the 5th highest prevalence of 14 diabetes in this age group. This information is essential to informing public health strategies, assessing disease 15 burden, and prioritizing type-specific health services. We will use EHR data from Geisinger, a health system 16 serving a large and diverse region of Pennsylvania, to expand the geography of existing surveillance of 17 diabetes subtypes in young adults to the Middle Atlantic, an area without prior EHR-based diabetes 18 surveillance estimates. This region includes a combination of rural and urban communities, enabling us to 19 evaluate differences in the performance of EHR-based algorithms for case ascertainment by community type. 20 In the first phase of the study, we will evaluate the validity; simplicity; and consistency of EHR-based 21 algorithms for identifying diabetes subtypes. This work will build on previously developed algorithms from the 22 SEARCH and DiYA studies. We will use manual review of clinician notes as the gold standard to determine the 23 positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of these algorithms. We propose to use an innovative, 24 efficient, and rigorous validation approach that incorporates natural language processing of clinician notes. We 25 will use a secondary data source, administrative claims data, to assess data completeness and our ability to 26 distinguish between incident and prevalent cases. In the second phase, we will use the best performing 27 algorithms to report on the annual incidence and prevalence of diabetes, by type, in young adults, between 28 2014 and 2024 in 38 Pennsylvania counties. All analyses will be stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance 29 status, and community type (rural/urban). Finally, we will coordinate with CDC and other sites to conduct joint 30 analyses of aggregated data, greatly expanding the population under study. Narrative Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence and prevalence estimates in this age group have been increasing. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The proposed research will coordinate, develop, implement, and validate electronic-record based surveillance of diabetes in young adults, by subtype, to inform type-specific public health responses, assess disease burden, and identify priorities for type-specific health services.",Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania,10223098,U18DP006509,[' '],NCCDPHP,GEISINGER CLINIC,U18,2021,250000
"Using Real-world Data to Assess the Burden of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents in Florida ABSTRACT Strong evidence suggests an increasing trend of diabetes onset for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1DM & T2DM) among children and adolescent in the United State (US) and globally since 2000. Significant racial- ethnic and geographic disparities have also been documented in diabetes incidence and in access to care and metabolic control in this vulnerable population. These alarming observations call for a timely surveillance system for the onset of diabetes among children and adolescents, so that tailored public health programs can be developed and health care resources can be efficiently allocated to address the needs of these vulnerable groups in a timely manner. However, diabetes surveillance studies on this particular population are limited in the US. The primary source for current prevalence and incidence estimates of diabetes among children and adolescents in the US for the CDC is from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study, which relies on an active case reporting system from enrolled clinical centers over ten states. The SEARCH study is important, however, does not include the majority of the population located at the south-east region, where diabetes prevalence was found to be the highest in the country among the adult population (i.e., the “diabetes belt”). Less is known if the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in this area, including Florida, are also the highest in the country. In this proposed study, we will build a surveillance system in Florida to monitor the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in an accurate, cost-effective, and timely fashion. As the 3rd-most populous state in the United States with a high level of racial-ethnical and geographic diversities, Florida will serve as an essential piece for the national diabetes surveillance system and provide important data to study the diabetes epidemiology among children and adolescents in the south-east region of the US where diabetes was found the most prevalent in the country. We will leverage our unique real-world data (RWD) source, the OneFlorida network, a large state-wide repository of RWD that contains linked EHRs, claims, vital statistics, and birth records data, covering more than 60% of Floridians across all 67 Florida counties to build this diabetes surveillance system. In particular, we will combine the structured and unstructured data (e.g., physician’s notes) from patients EHRs to develop novel data-driven computable phenotyping (CP) algorithms through modern machine learning methods, so that our estimations on the prevalence and incidence of T1DM and T2DM will be more accurate than prior EHRs-based systems. This study will also generate important data to study the social and behavioral determinants of health among many other potential contributing factors that results in ethnic-racial and geographic disparities of the diabetes, at both individual (e.g., individual health behaviors) and contextual levels (e.g., area-level access to metabolic control programs). PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes data and surveillance studies among children and adolescents are significantly limited in the United State, especially in the south-east region, where diabetes was found to be the most prevalent.

"Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes Abstract Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus (hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE). Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe between group differences in HbA1c, β-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out- of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in β- cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing, the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease progression in those with early-stage T2D. Project Narrative Limiting blood sugar peaks following meals is an important treatment goal in the management of type 2 diabetes, but evidence is mixed regarding the best dietary approach to achieve this goal. One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations may fail to limit blood sugar peaks because individuals differ greatly in their blood sugar responses to the very same foods. In this study we will compare two Mediterranean-type diabetic diets, one that has been standardized and one that has been personalized using a gut microbiome-based algorithm to limit blood sugar peaks following meals.",Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes,10119622,R01NR018916,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Beta Cell', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Counseling', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Endocrinology', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'design', 'dietary', 'dietary approach', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'microbiome', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social cognitive theory', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,743162
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,10204099,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,378686
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,10231054,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'automated algorithm', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'military veteran', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization', 'unstructured data']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2021,238049
"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies. NARRATIVE Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in diabetes development. We will evaluate novel epitranscriptomic mechanisms linking arsenic to diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in American Indian communities. This study can provide insight into novel pathways of arsenic related diabetes, identify prevention interventions, and inform recommendations for arsenic levels in water and food.",The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes.,10140691,R01ES032638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'American Indians', 'Arizona', 'Arsenic', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Stress Response', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disputes', 'Elderly man', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Heart', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Stability', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'South Dakota', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Whole Blood', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'preventive intervention', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,684582
"12/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort.

"6/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection.

The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. and California leads the nation in incident cases and costs of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic status, older adults, rural populations, and racial and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these disparities include a complex combination of interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes interventions into widespread practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a range of settings are desperately needed. The Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity science through the development and translation of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare delivery systems that substantively reduce health inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities. Focusing on the northern California and Central Valley regions of California, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct clinical research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system, community and policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together translational science core faculty who have expertise in diverse, multi-level areas including: food insecurity, medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy, and cost effectiveness analysis. DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of public and non-profit health systems that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment Program, and three coordinated research cores - Health Equity & Action Translational (HEAT) core, Methods and Data Integration (MDI) translational core, and National Diabetes Policy Research Resource (DPR) core. The HEAT Core will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing rigorous action-oriented observational and interventional research. The MDI Core will systematically prepare and support DREAMS-CDTR members in harnessing novel advances in methods and data to achieve greater health equity in Type 2 Diabetes. Lastly, the novel National DPR Core will extend the reach of the DREAMS-CDTR expertise and resources beyond the primary institutions in five key areas of expertise: (1) natural experiments research,(2) health economics, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis; (3) simulation modeling, (4) machine learning, and (5) communicating science to policy-making institutions, community partners, health departments, and human service organizations. Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and refocus the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) (P30 DK092924), renamed the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS- CDTR), on reducing diabetes related health disparities and improving health equity. Refocused on northern California and its Central Valley, the DREAMS-CDTR is a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. This Center leverages expertise in two Core Translational Research areas of health equity and methods and data integration and from a national diabetes policy resources core to accelerate the translation of diabetes research into changes in healthcare delivery, public health practice, and policy.",the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR),10290745,P30DK092924,"['Area', 'Attention', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Community Health Systems', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural experiment', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Policy Research', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Policies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data integration', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'diabetes risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'food insecurity', 'health care delivery', 'health communication', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'health equity', 'health equity promotion', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'scaffold', 'service organization', 'support network', 'systems research', 'telehealth', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2021,735000
"Electronic Bypass for Diabetes Diabetes affects more than 9% of Americans and costs over $245 billion in 2012 in USA. Recently bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, has been proposed for treating diabetic patients with obesity due to its hypoglycemic effect on postprandial blood glucose and significant weight loss.  A novel method of intestinal electrical stimulation (IES) is proposed for the treatment of diabetes in this application. In this method, IES is designed to alter gastrointestinal transit and hormones, including incretin hormones, such as glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Our preliminary studies have demonstrated acceleration of intestinal transit, an increase in postprandial GLP-1 and a reduction in blood glucose after oral glucose. Chronically, the proposed IES has resulted in improvement in glycemic control and improvement in pancreatic islets functions. According to these findings, we hypothesize that the acute hypoglycemic effect of IES in the postprandial state is attributed to IES-induced enhancement in the release of GLP-1 and possibly other hormones as well, such as ghrelin, and that the chronic hypoglycemic effect of IES in both fasting and fed states is attributed to improvement in beta-cell functions, attributed to the prevention of the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia and the ameliorating effect of IES-induced elevated GLP-1 on beta-cell functions.  The project will be performed using advanced technologies (wireless stimulation and recording cages, and autonomic and continuous food intake monitoring) that allow IES to be conducted in freely moving animals. The best characterized animal model of spontaneous Type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat will be used to accomplish following specific aims: 1) To optimize IES parameters, develop on-demand IES and perform closed-loop IES. First, we will systematically optimized stimulation parameters to maximize the hypoglycemic effect of IES. Then we will develop an algorithm to automatically detect food intake and then trigger IES upon food ingestion. It will be based on characteristics of intrinsic intestinal myoelectrical activity and artificial neural network. The meal triggered IES will avoid excessive stimulation. Finally, a closed-loop IES method (each stimulus is synchronized with intrinsic intestinal myoelectrical activity) will be developed to further increase the efficacy of IES for diabetes. 2) To study the hypoglycemic mechanisms of acute IES involving incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, and ghrelin, and the intestinal transit mechanisms involved in the IES-induced elevation of insulin-stimulating gastrointestinal hormones. 3) To explore cellular mechanisms of chronic IES on long-term glycemic control. Chronic IES will be performed to investigate long-term hypoglycemic effects of IES in both fasting and fed states, and mechanisms involving pancreatic islets functions, beta-cell apoptosis and proliferation, and a number of transcription factors involved in the regulation of β-cell development, differentiation and function. Possible involvement of L-cells in the distal gut will also be investigated. Diabetes affects more than 9% of Americans and cost $245 billion per year in the USA. In this project we propose a new method for the treatment of diabetes by placing a pair of tiny wires on the surface of the small bowel and sending a weak electrical current to the small bowel via these wires. Such a weak electrical current makes the emptying of the stomach slower and movement of the small bowel faster so that fewer nutrients are absorbed by the body.",Electronic Bypass for Diabetes,10179364,R01DK107754,"['Acceleration', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Development', 'Beta Cell', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bypass', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Controlled Study', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Eating', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Excision', 'Fasting', 'Food', 'GLP-I receptor', 'GLUT-2 protein', 'Gastrectomy', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide', 'Gastrointestinal Hormones', 'Gastrointestinal Transit', 'Gastroparesis', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hunger', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Insulin', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Intestinal Bypasses', 'Intestines', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'L Cells', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbid Obesity', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Pancreas', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Small Intestines', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'algorithm development', 'analog', 'artificial neural network', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'diabetic rat', 'experimental study', 'ghrelin', 'glucagon-like peptide 1', 'glycemic control', 'ileum', 'improved', 'incretin hormone', 'insulin secretion', 'novel', 'obese patients', 'pancreatic islet function', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,453283
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10252045,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,176996

"Detecting, Understanding, and Reducing Diabetes Belt Preventive Care Disparities Project Summary  The economic costs of diabetes are huge with $176 billion in direct medical costs in 2012 and over 30% of Medicare expenditures spent on persons with diabetes. Of all healthcare expenditures attributed to diabetes, only 14% are spent to treat diabetes itself and the rest are spent to treat diabetic complications. Prevention of diabetic complications is important to reduce the economic burden of diabetes on national healthcare expenditures. American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend preventive care to reduce the risk of these complications. Because these complications disproportionately affect the elderly, preventive care is also a special area of concern for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Reducing health disparities and improving rates of preventive care utilization is national priority as reflected in Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce health disparities and improve rates of diabetes preventive care (Objectives D4-D14).  The “Diabetes Belt” is a recently identified group of counties with especially high diabetes prevalence (≥11% compared to 8.5% average in the rest of the country). The Diabetes Belt is comprised of two medically disadvantaged populations, namely, low-income whites in Appalachia and blacks in the rural South. These populations have high mortality risk which is mainly attributable to high chronic disease burden. Our analysis of 2008 – 2010 BRFSS data shows that elderly persons (ages ≥ 65 years) with diabetes in the Diabetes Belt had almost 30% lower uptake of diabetes preventive services such as annual foot exam, annual eye exam, and diabetes self-management education compared to their counterparts in the rest of the country. They also had 12 – 23% higher rates of diabetes-related comorbidities such as heart attack, stroke, and health-related disability than those outside the Belt.  The proposed study is a comprehensive research program that involves detecting, understanding, and reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care between the counties in the Diabetes Belt and the surrounding areas and within the Diabetes Belt itself. Detection involves measuring disparities in preventive service use and diabetic complications using Medicare claims data. Understanding involves identifying individual-level and county-level determinants of disparities. Finally, the third phase “reducing” involves developing optimal policy options using Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis. In addition to the traditional factors such as race/ethnicity, income, access to care, and healthcare supply, we will evaluate the role of public policy (e.g., Annual Wellness Visits) and local community partnerships in reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care use. In addition, we propose to use “efficiency” in producing preventive services as a new “metric” to measure disparities and to identify areas of targeted action. Project Narrative Preventive services recommended by the American Diabetes Association are important in preventing diabetic complications that create huge burden on the nation’s health expenditures. The “Diabetes Belt” is a recently identified group of counties with especially high diabetes prevalence (≥11% compared to 8.5% average in the rest of the country). This study will examine factors that are associated with disparities in the use of diabetes preventive care among residents in the Diabetes Belt, identify geographic areas that can be targeted for effective intervention to reduce disparities, and provide intervention recommendations for these areas.","Detecting, Understanding, and Reducing Diabetes Belt Preventive Care Disparities",10102234,R01DK113295,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'Appalachian Region', 'Area', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Low income', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Stroke', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Visit', 'burden of illness', 'community partnership', 'comorbidity', 'diabetes self-management', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'economic cost', 'effective intervention', 'foot', 'frontier counties', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medically underserved population', 'mortality risk', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,514463
"Image Analysis and Machine Learning Methods for Biomarkers of Age-related and Metabolic Diseases Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makrogiannis, Sokratis, Ph.D. Abstract Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function.  Modern medical imaging technologies offer the opportunity to study the composition and morphometry of human body in ways that were previously impossible. Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo on a large number of participants have enabled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions. The emergence of advanced imaging technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for identification and quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing age.  This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on identification of morphological patterns in the mid-thigh, abdomen and lower leg that will eventually lead to development of imaging biomarkers. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body and changes of its regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass, frequently termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. Also, trabecular bone structural changes are associated with osteoporosis. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US.  This work will address a technical and a clinical hypothesis. The technical hypothesis is that quantitative image analysis can accurately and robustly segment, register and fuse body composition data acquired by modern MRI and CT imaging scanners. The clinical hypothesis is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging can be used as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome manifestations. We will build on recent advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive techniques for studying the human body composition and its longitudinal changes with main applications in tissue identification and quantification at the mid-thigh, lower leg and the abdomen (aim 1). Then we will develop statistical machine learning methods to achieve timely diagnosis and prognosis of metabolic and age-related conditions including the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis, and to track the effect of interventions (aim 2).

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,10221675,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2021,168817
"UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE To advance our understanding of bladder dysfunction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), this project links existing information on diabetes severity from a large NIH study to new assessments of urinary symptoms and bladder dysfunction and urine specimens for gene expression analyses. This work will contribute comprehensive critical data to expand our knowledge about the natural history and molecular mechanisms of bladder dysfunction in T1D.",UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes,10205344,R01DK116723,"['Achievement', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Amputation', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Urothelium', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autonomic neuropathy', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'incontinence symptom', 'insight', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mechanotransduction', 'member', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,722963
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10242094,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2021,193318
"Genetic and Epidemiological Predictors of Glucose Homeostasis Measures Summary Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are traits that have a significant impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The over-arching goal of this proposal is to understand the pathophysiology underlying variation of these intermediate phenotypes in Mexican Americans, the largest US minority group and one at high risk of T2D. The Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics (GUARDIAN) Consortium represents the largest effort to identify the genetic determinants underlying diabetes-related intermediate phenotypes (DK085175). During the previous funding period, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on common genetic variation identified four genome-wide significant loci underlying variation in glucose homeostasis traits which translated to the clinical endpoint, T2D. In this application, we will build upon significant prior genetic findings with integration of biological (metabolomics) and analytical (hierarchical clustering and interaction analysis) approaches to further refine insulin resistance and insulin secretion phenotypes and explore their biological basis. Aim 1 will develop a novel methodology using existing GWAS and metabolomics data to impute genetically regulated metabolites (GReM) and test their association with measures of glucose homeostasis in the GUARDIAN Consortium. Aim 2 will refine known and novel variants associated with T2D and related phenotypes through hierarchical clustering and perform interaction analyses which exploit the bimodal nature of T2D to identify additional insulin resistance loci. Aim 3 will identify genetic determinants of dynamic measures of glucose homeostasis in diverse human populations and translate these loci to T2D. The unique strengths of this proposal include detailed phenotypes for glucose homeostasis that have not been extensively examined in the GWAS setting, a focus on the Mexican American population, and our long-standing, highly productive collaborative team. This project has great public health significance as it is focused on increasing our biological understanding and resultant mechanisms for the prevention of T2D using pre-diabetic measures of glucose homeostasis.

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation design', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036
"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886

Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10259878,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,714718
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955
"Indiana University clinical Center for acute pancreatitis and diabetes clinical research network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pancreatogenic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes (T3cDM), is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). Recent data suggest that T3cDM occurs more commonly than previously recognized and exhibits a spectrum of defects including features that overlap aspects of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. At present, the extent to which immune activation, β cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance occur following AP and the genetic, metabolic and imaging correlates of these phenotypes have not been characterized. To address these knowledge gaps, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pancreatitis and exocrine pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, diabetes genetics, and pancreatic imaging at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The IU Clinical Center will work with other members of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium to test the hypothesis that T3cDM encompasses a heterogeneous combination of metabolic and potentially immunologic phenotypes that are determined by distinct underlying pathophysiologies. We propose the following specific aims (SA) to meet the goals of this RFA. SA #1: To perform an observational study of robustly characterized adults with AP in order to address knowledge gaps in the natural history and incidence of autoantibody-positive diabetes (AAb+), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and diabetes occurring subsequent to AP. Enrolled participants will be longitudinally characterized with emphasis on identifying genetic, immunological, metabolic, and clinical risk factors for the development of AAb+, IGT/IFG, or T3cDM. We will use state-of-the-art immunologic phenotyping and measurements of pancreatic β cell function to define the physiologic basis for metabolic dysregulation in T3cDM after AP. In tandem, a biorepository will be developed for undertaking translational, mechanistic and biomarker investigations and ancillary studies. SA#2: The Imaging Morphology of Pancreas in Diabetic Patients following Acute Pancreatitis (IMMINENT) study aims to utilize novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients at risk for the development of post-AP T3cDM. This longitudinal study will evaluate pancreatic parenchymal morphologic and pathophysiologic changes following AP in AAb+, euglycemic, IGT and DM individuals. Imaging phenotypes will be correlated with the metabolic, genetic and immunological phenotypes established in SA#1. SA#3: To perform a nested case control study using state-of-the-art techniques to define the underlying pathophysiology of endocrine and exocrine function in the subgroup of AAb+ individuals with AP-associated metabolic dysfunction relative to those who remain normoglycemic. We will undertake detailed metabolic phenotyping to evaluate islet cell responses (i.e. β and alpha cell function) in parallel with arginine-augmented hyperglycemic clamp methodology to measure functional β cell mass, and endoscopic assessment to define the relationship between impaired exocrine and endocrine function in AAb+ T3cDM. We will utilize 25 individuals with AAb+ and IGT or T3cDM and compare findings to results in 25 normoglycemic individuals with negative autoantibodies from SA#1. PROJECT NARRATIVE While diabetes is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), a full understanding of the underlying etiology of this disorder is lacking. To address this gap in knowledge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team at Indiana University, with expertise in exocrine pancreas pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, genetics, and pancreatic imaging.

"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10264897,U01DK127400,"['Acute', 'Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Beta Cell', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes autoantibodies', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucagon', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Total Pancreatectomy', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'improved', 'islet', 'macrovascular disease', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'subcutaneous', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,286563
"Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear.

"Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL) remains the limiting factor for achieving optimal glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with nocturnal hypoglycemia being particularly dangerous. Nocturnal hypoglycemia may result in physical injury, poor sleep quality, fear of hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia unawareness. Severe episodes can cause seizures and unconsciousness requiring emergency care, and even death (dead in bed syndrome). While automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have shown benefits in glucose control during the night, nighttime hypoglycemia still occurs. Moreover, many people with T1D manage their glucose with continuous subcutaneous infusion pump (CSII) therapy or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) therapy. Data updated between 2013 and 2014 from 16,061 individuals with T1D participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry showed that approximately 40% participants managed their glucose with MDI. In this project, we propose to develop and evaluate a personalized decision support tool that collects and analyzes glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and physical activity data to predict at bedtime the likelihood of overnight hypoglycemia and recommend a proactive carbohydrate intervention to substantially reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. In the engineering development phase of the project, we will use unique datasets of time-matched glucose management data (i.e., continuous glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and exercise) from pump, closed- loop and MDI users to extract information about the major contributors to nocturnal hypoglycemia risk and train a population-based prediction model that will be personalized over time to better capture inter-subject variability. We will design a bedtime intervention consisting of a bedtime smart snack with variable nutrient content that can prevent nighttime hypoglycemia. Snacks will vary by macronutrient content and size to optimize time to peak post-prandial glycemia that will match the timing to predicted episode of hypoglycemia. We will conduct a randomized cross-over study to evaluate our smartphone-based decision support tool on a cohort of 20 people with T1D who are MDI users and are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia. Participants will be randomly assigned to either first use CGM only (control period) followed by a smartphone- based decision support tool + nocturnal hypoglycemia intervention (intervention period), or vice-versa. The control and intervention periods will have a duration of three weeks each. We will measure the effect of the intervention by comparing the percent time in nocturnal hypoglycemia during the control period vs. the intervention period. We will also retrospectively measure the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia using data from the control period. We expect that the proposed bedtime intervention will lead to a significant reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia overnight of at least 50% reduction relative to baseline. Project Narrative Nocturnal hypoglycemia is one of the most challenging side effects of insulin-intensive diabetes therapy and accounts for more than 50% of level 2 hypoglycemia events (glucose < 54 mg/dL). Despite new glucose sensing technologies and automated insulin delivery systems, nocturnal hypoglycemia is a common problem for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with potentially fatal consequences as symptoms and sensor alarms may not be detected while sleeping. We propose to design a personalized decision support tool to accurately predict and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia in people with T1D who are using either multiple daily insulin injections, pumps, or closed-loop control; and we will evaluate the developed machine learning based prediction models and a smart snack bedtime intervention within a clinical study involving people on multiple daily insulin injections therapy.",Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,10373516,R21DK128582,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Big Data', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emergency Care', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fiber', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'data management', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'hypoglycemia unawareness', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'large datasets', 'personalized decision', 'poor sleep', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'sleep quality', 'subcutaneous', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,162600
"Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide Summary People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have autoimmune destruction of beta cells resulting in insufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, thereby requiring exogenous insulin treatment, typically delivered subcutaneously either continuously infused through an insulin pump or by injection multiple times throughout the day. There are now commercial closed loop systems available that enable automated delivery of fast- acting insulin in response to wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors that inform an automated control algorithm to calculate and deliver insulin via a pump. Unfortunately, current commercial closed loop systems are hybrid systems that require users to announce meals to the system, and these hybrid systems do not control glucose well following meals. People oftentimes forget to announce their meals or misestimate their carbohydrate intake, thereby leading to poor overall postprandial glucose control. The primary benefit of hybrid closed loop systems has been during the overnight period when meals are not consumed. In a normal working beta cell, the hormone amylin is co-secreted with insulin in response to meals to help suppress glucagon production and delay gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose increases. Pramlintide is an analog of the endogenous hormone amylin. Our commercial partner, Adocia, has developed a coformulation of insulin and pramlintide. In this project, we will develop a dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system with a meal detection algorithm that will enable substantial improvements in postprandial glycemic control for people with T1D while minimizing patient burden by not requiring a meal announcement to the system. Our group has previously developed a multi hormone closed loop system (insulin and glucagon) and we have developed models of insulin, pramlintide, glucagon, and carbohydrate kinetics and dynamics that will be integrated into a new insulin+pramlintide closed loop model predictive control (MPC) system (Aim 1). We have also developed a meal detection algorithm that will be integrated with this MPC control algorithm to dose insulin and pramlintide shortly after a meal is detected, thereby eliminating the need for the user to announce this meal to the system (Aim 1). We will use our in silico simulator of glucose metabolism to identify the optimal dosing amount and timing when insulin and pramlintide are delivered in response to the meal detection algorithm (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapies identified in Aim 1 and evaluate the top 4 strategies during an in-clinic meal test in a 4-arm randomized crossover study in 14 people with T1D (Study 1a, Aim 2). We will then evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy identified in Study 1a and compare with various insulin-only hybrid and automated therapies in an in-clinic randomized crossover study (Study 1b, Aim2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy determined in Aim 2 and compare it with the Tandem Diabetes Control-IQ commercial hybrid closed loop system. Narrative People with type 1 diabetes have difficulty managing their glucose levels, especially during the daytime in response to carbohydrate intake; persistently elevated glucose levels can lead to dangerous, poor overall health outcomes including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. We will develop a new dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system that can automatically detect meals and dose in response to these meals. By combining the slowed gastric emptying and suppression of endogenous glucose production that pramlintide provides with a meal detection algorithm, we expect to translate a fully automated closed loop system with minimal patient burden that can achieve substantial improvements in glycemic control both during the evening and during the day.",Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide,10276661,R01DK129382,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beta Cell', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Gastroparesis', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin, Aspart, Human', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Pramlintide', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Retinal Diseases', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'analog', 'arm', 'autoimmune pathogenesis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'clinical efficacy', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'in silico', 'islet amyloid polypeptide', 'patient population', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'virtual patient']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,560513
"The role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans PROJECT SUMMARY Mounting evidence links the gut microbiome – the modifiable “second genome” consisting of trillions of diverse microbes that inhabit the human gut – with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans. Studies using fecal transplant in mice have raised the central hypothesis that changes of the gut microbiome and the biochemical by-products originated from these microbes may be key modulators of development of T2DM. To date, however, knowledge of the specific microbial species that drive the development of T2DM in humans remain very limited. Human studies of the gut microbiome in T2DM have largely been cross-sectional and confounded by reverse causality. Indeed, many of the gut microbiome changes observed in human T2DM have been found to be a consequence of the disease or treatments, including the medication metformin, rather than a cause of T2DM. In addition, the circulating metabolites derived from the gut microbes that contribute to the development of T2DM remain to be discovered. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest prospective study of the role of gut microbiome in T2DM using a Finnish cohort of 6921 individuals with fecal and plasma samples collected in 2002 and over 15 years of subsequent clinical follow up. This proposed study brings together a diverse team with deep expertise in the human microbiome, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, computational biology, statistical epidemiology, and diabetes pathobiology, to specifically address the key biological and clinical questions regarding the role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of incident T2DM in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The gut microbiome are key modulators of human health and disease. To date, we have a limited understanding of the specific gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.

"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10286549,R21DK130018,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Preventive screening', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data repository', 'diabetes control', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'macrovascular disease', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'sociodemographics', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,248958
"Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in diabetes care technology over the past several decades, including improvements in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), have led to more streamlined treatments and reduced burden for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As the field moves toward increasingly autonomous, closed-loop systems for management of T1D, infusion set failure (ISF) remains a health risk to patients and a barrier to the development of artificial pancreas systems. ISF, the disruption of fluid flow from insulin pump to patient causing loss of glycemic control, affects an estimated 50% of pump wearers, placing them at risk for hyperglycemia and life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Because modern insulin pumps are not equipped with a mechanism for monitoring infusion performance, patients may not know an ISF has occurred until experiencing symptoms of hyperglycemia. There is no existing technology capable of accurately identifying ISF in real-time, before dysregulation of blood glucose (BG). Diatech Diabetes is addressing this unmet need with SmartFusion, an AI-based platform to monitor infusion performance, immediately alert patients when ISF occurs, and help users infuse confidently and safely. Diatech’s novel algorithm leverages tissue counter pressure (TCP) and CGM data to offer a superior method for ISF detection. The company’s long-term vision is that by detecting ISF in real time, SmartFusion will improve patients’ glycemic control, prevent complications of hyperglycemia, and reduce excess medical costs. Diatech has already collected preliminary data to show that TCP waveforms can feasibly be leveraged to differentiate healthy and malfunctioned infusions. The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to collect increasingly complex and representative preclinical data to train and optimize the TCP-CGM algorithm and demonstrate proof-of-concept that it can accurately detect ISF. Diatech will pursue this goal through the following aims: 1) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and x-ray imaging data of typical and malfunctioned infusions, 2) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and BG/CGM data of failure modes consistent with ISF in immobilized diabetic swine, and 3) collect 3-day TCP and BG/CGM data from ambulatory diabetic swine with failure modes consistent with ISF. Successful completion of the project will result in a novel TCP-CGM algorithm to accurately detect ISF in closed- loop systems. The algorithm will be further optimized through collection and integration of clinical data in Phase II. SmartFusion will ultimately be integrated into insulin pumps and diabetes management platforms to provide real-time ISF detection and personalized recommendations for ISF prevention. Further, by enabling new avenues for control of closed-loop systems, SmartFusion can offer a significant leap forward for implementation of artificial pancreas technology, leading to improved health and quality of life for patients living with T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than one million type 1 diabetes patients throughout the world rely on insulin pumps to deliver their vital medication, but infusion failures are common and can lead to serious and costly complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. There is no existing technology that accurately detects infusion failures and alerts patients to disruptions in treatment before they develop elevated blood glucose. To address this unmet need, Diatech Diabetes is developing SmartFusion, a first-of-its-kind, algorithm-based software platform that uses fluid pressure to monitor infusion performance, identify infusion failures, and alert patients before blood glucose is adversely affected, enabling better management of their type 1 diabetes.",Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management,10296116,R43DK130036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Glucose', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cannulas', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hour', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'Infection', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniature Swine', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'field study', 'fluid flow', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'irritation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'subcutaneous']",NIDDK,"DIATECH DIABETES, INC.",R43,2021,299989
"A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A role for glycemic variation in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications It is well demonstrated that high glucose levels lead to more rapid development of macrovascular and microvascular complications in people with diabetes. However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10219353,R21HL150374,"['Algorithms', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'diabetes management', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrovascular disease', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'standard care', 'success', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,127224
