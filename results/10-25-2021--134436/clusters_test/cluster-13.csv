"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia.",Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke,10177996,R01DC013270,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,548529
"Public sharing of the Aphasia Recovery Cohort Project Summary/Abstract The Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR, P50-DC014664) explores recovery from language impairments following stroke. The center acquires a broad range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities as well behavioral measures from stroke patients experiencing language impairments. Like all modern large scale NIH grants, C-STAR has a resource sharing plan that guides dissemination of curated data (following an embargo). However, in addition to this data, the C-STAR team has been acquiring images from people with aphasia using our Siemens 3T MRI scanner since 2006. This trove of data, which we refer to as the `Aphasia Recovery Cohort', or ARC, is the product of both internally supported and NIH funded awards that did not require resource sharing plans and includes data from 250 stroke survivors scanned during 5776 unique sessions. In addition to the imaging sessions, ARC patients participated in numerous treatment and assessment sessions providing a rich range of behavioral measures. The current proposal seeks to curate these data to provide an anonymized public database and search tool (ARCquery). This will allow data scientists from around the world to apply their expertise to this archival dataset, providing new insights into brain function as well as identifying predictors of recovery. This repository will provide a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR) dataset. Project Narrative This proposal will create a public repository that includes imaging data, behavioral assessments and demographic data from a group of people with aphasia.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anodes', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Double-blind trial', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Escitalopram', 'Family', 'Financial Support', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severities', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'chronic stroke', 'disability', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'syntax', 'telerehabilitation', 'therapy outcome']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2558826
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,10239050,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,721339
"Semantic Systems Project Summary Abstract. Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life. Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis, and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. Here, we focus on a brain region that has emerged as a core component of the conceptual system: anterior temporal lobe. This brain region has been the subject of intense research for over two decades not just in semantics, but in a number of other domains such as social cognition, sentence processing, and naming of familiar people and places. This has generated a rich and complex set of findings, some of which are often difficult to reconcile with each other. Insights into the function of this region that can shed light on its role in myriad functions would clearly be very valuable. Using neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and studies of patients with stroke, we examine predictions of a novel theory that can account for many findings relating to the anterior temporal lobe. The proposed experiments will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and impaired brain. Project Narrative. The breakdown of the conceptual system in the brain in many common neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, dementia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and schizophrenia, has a devastating impact on quality of life. Understanding how this information is organized, represented in the brain, and affected by neuropathology is a major focus of research. The proposed project will study brain regions believed to be crucial for this system, both in healthy subjects and in patients with aphasia due to stroke, leading to insights into the functioning of this system, a critical step in developing effective rehabilitation therapies.",Semantic Systems,10162579,R01DC017162,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysiology', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of middle temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angular gyrus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'combinatorial', 'density', 'domain mapping', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'insight', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'long short term memory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phrases', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'segregation', 'semantic processing', 'social cognition', 'stroke patient', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'theories', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,332549
"Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation. Public Health Relevance Statement Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. While aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, stroke size and location are significant determinants of outcomes. Research that leads to a more complete characterization of how stroke lesions affect residual brain function over the course of recovery will lead to a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in aphasia and has the potential to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation.",Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery,10214766,K99DC018828,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'biomarker development', 'brain behavior', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,121473
"Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Stroke is currently the third leading cause of death and leading cause of permanent disability in the United States. Due to the time-efficacy relationship associated with acute stroke interventions, tools which allow for accurate stroke diagnosis during triage have the potential to streamline care and improve patient outcomes. Early transport, transfer, and referral decisions are often made by emergency medical services personnel, triage nurses, and emergency physicians with limited neurological expertise using symptom-based stroke recognition scales. Unfortunately, these assessments exhibit limited accuracy in triage scenarios, and it is currently estimated that up to 30% of patients experiencing stroke are misdiagnosed at first clinician contact, leading to life threatening delays in care. As a result, there has been a push for the identification of stroke-specific blood biomarkers which could be rapidly measured at the point-of-care to help clinicians without extensive neurological expertise make better-informed early triage decisions. It is becoming increasingly evident that the peripheral immune system is intricately involved in stroke pathology, and may be targetable for the development of stroke diagnostics. Not only is there a rapid systemic inflammatory response to the acute injury, but emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immune changes may precede symptom onset and in some cases trigger the acute event itself. The peripheral blood contains up to 1018 unique antibodies targeting antigens associated with nearly every adaptive immune response an individual has experienced in their lifetime, and the repertoire of antibodies found in an individual’s blood can serve as a detailed molecular fingerprint of their immune history as well as current immune status. In the proposed investigation, we aim to identify stroke-associated alterations to the circulating antibody pool which could be used to aid in stroke recognition during triage. To address this aim, peripheral blood will be sampled from a group of consecutive patients suspected of stroke at emergency department admission. Upon final clinical diagnosis, patients will be divided into either a confirmed stroke group or a stroke mimic group. Peptide arrays comprised of 330,000 unique probes will be used to comprehensively assess the binding characteristics of each patient’s peripheral blood antibody pool, and a machine-learning approach will be used to identify a pattern of binding which can optimally discriminate between groups. This work will be the first ever to take a comprehensive approach to profiling the circulating antibody pool in stroke to globally search for disease-specific patterns of alterations; the level of throughput, in combination with the use of powerful machine-learning methods, will increase the odds of identifying diagnostically robust biomarker profiles. Furthermore, diagnostically useful probes identified via peptide array can be readily adapted for use at the point-of-care, providing a clear path to clinical use. This novel, innovative, and highly translational workflow will address an area of dire clinical need; we fully expect to identify a set of candidate peptide probes which will provide the immediate foundation for the development of a rapid point-of-care stroke triage diagnostic. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Quick and confident recognition of stroke at initial clinician contact increases the odds of successful treatment and positive outcome. The proposed clinical study aims to identify patterns of molecular changes in the immune system that are associated with stroke. If successful, the work will lay the immediate groundwork for the development of a rapid blood test that could be used to aid in stroke diagnosis.",Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage,10302835,R21NR019337,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Ambulances', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Area', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency medical service', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune system', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prehospital Emergency Care', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'adaptive immune response', 'antibody detection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'point-of-care detection', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'stroke intervention', 'stroke patient', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom science', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,201250
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,10222670,R01EB027777,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brachial Paresis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper limb movement', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'chronic stroke', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'functional disability', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'personalized management', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'web platform']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2021,493221
"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging. Robust D-bar methods, aided with a priori information from anatomical atlases, will be developed in 3D to address the stroke classiﬁcation and monitoring tasks from practical EIT data.",Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging,10064622,R21EB028064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Ambulances', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Atlases', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrodes', 'Failure', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Rural Community', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer classification', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical methods', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'tumor', 'voltage']",NIBIB,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,225052
"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10260456,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Bionics', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Electromyography', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'HRK gene', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Subject Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Spasticity', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Paresis', 'Patients', 'Physical Medicine', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'arm paresis', 'career', 'career development', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'exoskeleton', 'faculty mentor', 'functional restoration', 'graduate student', 'handbook', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lecturer', 'muscle strength', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'patient oriented', 'post stroke', 'professor', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'social', 'strength training', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'visual feedback']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2021,327384
"Enhanced Clinical Diagnosis through Imaging and Modeling: A Machine Learning Data Fusion Framework PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this proposal, we will use modern machine learning techniques to combine and enhance computational modeling predictions. We will overcome the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling assumptions by including ground-truth clinical measurements, but in turn provide predictions that are more informative (higher spatial and temporal resolution) than the original clinical measurements. Furthermore, we will implement this framework as a surrogate model that can be used in real time and can replace current models with prohibitively high computation cost. If successful, the proposed research will enable lab-to-bedside deployment of a vast array of existing and future computational models and it ultimately could lead to a paradigm shift in health care workflow.  Our overarching hypothesis is that the statistical correlations between computational models and clinical measurements can be exploited in a probabilistic data-fusion framework for more accurate predictions. Our multi-fidelity framework is based on an autoregressive Gaussian Process (GP) scheme. Our proposed scheme is a non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique that has a probabilistic workflow and estimates uncertainty at different levels of fidelity in a principled manner.  As a template for other clinical applications, we will develop this framework for perfusion scanning of brain hemodynamics in healthy and stroke populations, which has a significant health application. In Aim 1, we will simulate cerebral perfusion in healthy and stroke populations based on CT and MR angiography (CTA and MRA) scans. We will simulate and validate cerebral blood perfusion in healthy and stroke gender-balanced subjects. In Aim 2, we construct subject-specific multi-fidelity models by combining computational results and perfusion scans. We propose to leverage the multi-fidelity model to reduce scan time and radiation exposure by incorporating simulated perfusion maps with CT perfusion scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this proposal we aim to combine computational simulations with clinical measurements with the goal of enhancing the accuracy of the computational models and remedy the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling approaches.

"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,10074511,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,493168
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),10104421,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness analysis', 'disability', 'effectiveness outcome', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'safety outcomes', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509566
"Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second- ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char- acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out- comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over- all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ- ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy- pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu- nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice.

"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills.

"Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program PI Name(s): Moura, Lidia Maria Veras Rocha de   Project Title: Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program 1R01AG073410-01 Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD) receive anticonvulsant drugs for seizure prophylaxis. These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis. NARRATIVE Anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed to older adults after stroke to prevent seizures, but these drugs may not be necessary or the harms could outweigh the benefits. There is limited rigorous evidence guiding when and how physicians should prescribe this type of treatment. This project will use the real-world experience of millions of Medicare beneficiaries to generate this evidence and inform both policy and future clinical decisions.",Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program,10277748,R01AG073410,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Case Series', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Labeling', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitalization', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Committee for Quality Assurance', 'Neurology', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Provider', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scoring Method', 'Seizures', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'acute stroke', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'comparative safety', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'safety study', 'stroke event', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'treatment duration', 'trial comparing']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,841695
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,10168660,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'rare genetic disorder', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,119834
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,10240277,K02NS104207,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2021,228159
"Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY In the last four years, our group collected >1800 stroke emboli from centers across the US and Canada as part of the Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology (STRIP). The STRIP registry was our current R01 award’s Aim 1 and is very fruitful. We have further elucidated the association between clot histology and revascularization outcomes, as well as clot histology and imaging characteristics. The STRIP registry has also allowed us to uncover novel mechanisms in stroke thrombosis, catalyzing thrombectomy device research and thrombolysis related research in our lab. We believe that the most impactful finding from our registry will be uncovering associations between histopathology of retrieved emboli and stroke etiology. Developing tools to predict stroke etiology is important because nearly 40% of strokes are of unknown etiology. Determine stroke etiology (i.e. cardiac source versus large artery atherosclerosis) is important as secondary stroke prevention strategies are highly dependent on determination of stroke etiology. However, when we performed superficial quantitative analyses examining the relationships between fibrin, platelet, WBC and RBC density, our results were unrevealing. Still, we hypothesize that it remains feasible to predict stroke etiology based of analysis of retrieved stroke emboli through deep learning and machine learning approaches. Machine learning and deep learning approaches can also aid in uncovering histological features associated with device and pharmacological failure related to stroke revascularization. Thus, this administrative supplement’s goal of is to 1) allow for complete digitization and online archiving of our database of over 1800 retrieved clot specimens as well as all available anonymized clinical data from Aim 1 of our current R01 to facilitate deep learning and machine learning and 2) to perform deep learning on the whole slide specimens from these patients to determine if various deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be used to predict stroke etiology based solely off of the histological appearance of retrieved stroke emboli. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute ischemic stroke affects up to 800,000 people per year in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death. Mechanical thrombectomy has become standard of care for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion and up to 150,000 of these procedures will be performed annually by 2025. The etiology of the stroke is unclear in 30-40% of LVO cases. Understanding etiology is important for secondary stroke prevention strategies. The goal of this project is to predict stroke etiology based off histologic characteristics of retrieved clots using AI/ML techniques. The first step is to render our data AI ready which is the main focus of this administrative supplement.",Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement,10410193,R01NS105853,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Platelets', 'Canada', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Embolism', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrin', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Left atrial structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thrombectomy', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acute care', 'aortic arch', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'density', 'extracellular', 'grasp', 'histological specimens', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online repository', 'organizational structure', 'physical property', 'programs', 'shear stress', 'standard of care', 'stroke patient', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'von Willebrand Factor']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,315871
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,10237248,K08NS109315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation research', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,213840
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173
"Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements Abstract The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician- scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized, autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards personalized medicine in stroke.",Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements,10250412,K23NS110980,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Edema', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hemorrhage', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Step Tests', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical center', 'clinical investigation', 'computerized data processing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'endovascular thrombectomy', 'feasibility testing', 'functional outcomes', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stroke therapy', 'therapeutic effectiveness', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,189276
"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,10102290,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'endovascular thrombectomy', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384813
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.",DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY,10241401,U19NS115388,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Dementia', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive load', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'disability', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health disparity populations', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'morphometry', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'non-demented', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'post stroke cognitive impairment', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'stroke event', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular injury', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U19,2021,14058964
"Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation SUMMARY Upper limb motor function is often impaired due to neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to innovate effective motor rehabilitation for enhancing clinical outcomes in stroke populations by discovering and applying scientific mechanisms and developing new engineering technologies to facilitate neuromotor adaptation. In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice, such as motor imagery and action observation, is a very effective intervention when performed appropriately. The challenge is that performance quality and efficacy of mental practice are highly variable and can be compromised. It is hypothesized that control and observation of robotic grasp and release actions via synergistic proximal muscle activation will increase neuromotor excitability of the non-activated distal muscles and hand function due to cognitive engagement with the externally present and visible robotic prosthesis. The Specific Aim of this proof of concept and feasibility study is to develop and test robotically augmented mental practice with synergistic proximal muscles for neuromotor facilitation of hand muscles. A robotically augmented mental practice will be developed for individuals to grasp and release an object by controlling the associated actions of a sound- generating robotic prosthesis utilizing surface electromyography (EMG) of shoulder/trunk muscles with deep learning algorithms. To demonstrate the proof of concept of increased neuromotor excitability and hand performance in able-bodied adults, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the motor cortex for the non-activated hand muscles and reaction time and maximal voluntary contraction performances will be tested with a finger in various practice conditions. The feasibility and possible trends in stroke survivors with upper extremity disabilities will also be examined. The project will be performed at the Georgia Institute of Technology by an interdisciplinary team of experts in fields directly related to the study: an applied physiologist, mechanical and biomedical engineers, a physical therapist, and a clinical neuroscientist. The successful completion of the study will provide augmented mental practice for neuromotor facilitation for distal muscles, and evidence for efficacy will be provided in able-bodied adults and feasibility in post-stroke individuals. The results will lead to the development of a more effective priming intervention before physical practice that can facilitate functional improvement as part of stroke rehabilitation. This project will develop and test a new paradigm of motor imagery for facilitating neuromotor excitability and performance of distal muscles in the upper limb by adopting robotic prosthesis and integrating proven procedures for neuromotor facilitation. In this paradigm, individuals will interact with a robotic prosthesis by controlling the activation of the shoulder/trunk muscles that are functionally associated with the distal hand muscles. The development of this paradigm and its integration with able-bodied and post-stroke disabled individuals will open new scientific and clinical concepts and studies on augmented motor imagery, which can lead to the development of effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with neuromotor impairment, such as hemiparetic stroke survivors.",Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation,10301588,R21NS118435,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Auditory', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Distal', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Extensor', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Institute', 'Robotics', 'Shoulder', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Upper Extremity', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mental practice', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'physical therapist', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'robot control', 'sound', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'trend', 'virtual', 'visual motor']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,407538
"Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes, rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4) Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients, compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage and intervention, which is likely to translate to improved morbidity and mortality associated with these common conditions. Project Narrative Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of major disability and death, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic standards in stroke and TBI require that patients undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in a hospital setting to differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes before initiating treatment. Our study proposes to develop a portable, noninvasive stroke/TBI detection and imaging system based on tri-coil eddy current damping technology, thereby rapidly identifying stroke subtypes, accelerating time-to-treatment, and providing early responders with information necessary to more efficiently administer triaged and appropriate intervention in the field or acute care setting.",Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device,10100064,R01NS119596,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomic Models', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cadaver', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coma', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Gelatin', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological emergencies', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'base', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging detection', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'ischemic lesion', 'laboratory experiment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid technique', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,408993
"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3) volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP. We will pursue our project goal with three aims: - Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large academic and smaller community). - Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of EST eligibility.  – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results. Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to thousands of additional AIS patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE With endovascular stroke therapy, we now have the ability to dramatically improve patient outcomes after stroke. To date, however, screening for patients that may benefit from this procedure has been relegated to larger academic centers, as the advanced imaging modalities required for this evaluation are not widely available. The goal of our proposal is to develop and validate machine learning-based software tools to identify patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy using CT angiography, an imaging modality readily available in the vast majority of community hospitals.",Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals,10184809,R01NS121154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry Standard', 'Infarction', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'brain tissue', 'care delivery', 'community center', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'heterogenous data', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'screening', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'support tools', 'thrombolysis', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,481432
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment. The objective of this project is to develop a magnetic resonance technique for prediction of treatment response, which may potentially help prevent recurrent stroke by early identifying non-responsive patients and initiating an alternative therapy.",Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis,10331648,R01HL147355,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'morphometry', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized management', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,446451
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers,10248545,R01HL149787,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Angioplasty', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Infarction', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Control Groups', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Flowmeters', 'Gender', 'General Hospitals', 'Graph', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Arterial Stenosis', 'Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intracranial artery', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'prognostic significance', 'risk stratification', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,490343
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Atrial Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'aptamer', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'patient oriented research', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'stroke risk', 'supportive environment', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K24,2021,126631
