"The RCMI Program in Health Disparities at Meharry Medical College - Supplement Abstract Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a Historically Black College/University located in Nashville Tennessee and the first medical school for African Americans in the South. It has a School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, and School of Graduate Studies & Research. In February 2021, it established a new fourth school, the School of Applied Computational Sciences (SACS), to provide academic training in data science and computing-related research on a variety of areas including medical, social, and environmental issues and trends that impact the health of minority and underserved populations. The Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Program at MMC (in Health Disparities Research, RHDR@MMC) is a long-term NIMHD- funded endeavor that enables high quality basic, behavioral, and clinical research to eliminate health disparities. Our RCMI U54 grant supports health disparities research in many diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and neurological diseases that disproportionally affect non-Hispanic Black population in the US. With the great potential of data science to transform industries, health care, and scientific discovery, this administrative supplement seeks to enhance the data science capacity of the RHDR@MMC program and foster collaborations between RCMI researchers and data scientists, to enable the RCMI investigators to assess and analyze big health sciences data to enhance the overall productivity of the RCMI program as well as contribute to addressing health disparities. Specifically, this supplement award will help create a data science task force for this project, identify data science needs of the RCMI researchers at Meharry, and foster collaborations between them and the data science experts in SACS which will include the development of a joint RCMI/SACS Workshop. This will enable SACS to provide RCMI researchers with much needed data science expertise and resources for study design, data infrastructure, data collection, data engineering, health informatics, and machine learning techniques, to enhance research outcome as well as the cooperation among investigators from different domains. It will enable the RCMI researchers of all levels to better address the challenges in their health disparities research. With this award, we expect that the RHDR@MMC program will be greatly empowered to advance research on minority health and health disparities. This administrative supplement will help the data scientists in the School of Applied Computational Sciences at Meharry Medical College understand and address the computing needs of the RCMI researchers at Meharry and, hence, foster the collaborations between them. In addition, the data science training enabled by the supplement award, small collaborative research groups created, and summer research support for graduate students will substantially enhance the data analytics skills of the RCMI investigators, staff, medical residents, and graduate students at Meharry. Moreover, by enabling efforts to create and deliver data sets, platforms, research collaboration, and targeted educational modules, this project will facilitate the RCMI investigators to assess and analyze big health sciences data to enhance the overall productivity of the RCMI program as well as contribute to addressing health disparities.",The RCMI Program in Health Disparities at Meharry Medical College - Supplement,10451237,U54MD007586,[' '],NIMHD,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U54,2021,363750
"Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need, the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40 trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to- instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation, followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include: Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome), metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students, including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross- training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10259775,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2021,10000
"Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans Project Summary The long-term goal of this research is to establish a pipeline for automated image processing that enhances cadaveric non-contrast enhanced (NCE) CT data and extracts meaningful models and metrics to improve anatomy research and education. The objective is to develop the necessary toolset for this image processing, and feature extraction. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to enrich the information content of biomedical imaging data, particularly that of cadaveric NCE CT imaging, for use in gross anatomy education and research. The rationale behind this project is that cadaveric dissection, while an important part of anatomy education, is limited due to sample size, infrastructure, cost, and time. Biomedical imaging can preserve specimens for posterity and be used to supplement this material by providing statistical and quantitative information from anatomical structures. This research will attempt to establish a working pipeline for efficient information extraction through the following specific aims: (1) Improving inter-observer anatomical agreement in cadaveric CT scans; (2) Develop an approach to automatically segment anatomical structures from non-contrast enhanced CT images; and (3) Establish normal variation of anatomical structures and its relationship to pathologies. This project is innovative because it applies artificial intelligence to efficiently extract anatomical information from cadaveric NCE CT imaging, which has only been performed with traditional registration- dependent methods that often fail and are domain specific, acting on a single organ at a time. In addition, this project works with multi-species data to enhance human image data.  This project is significant because it will allow students to understand anatomical variation better by both expanding student exposure to more samples, while also extracting useful representations and analytics from these samples for education and research. The expected outcome of this project is a toolset that is capable of enhancing anatomy education and research by increasing soft-tissue contrast, automatically segmenting the kidneys, liver, mandible, and intraosseus sites of the cranial nerves, and performing statistical analysis on these organs, including but not limited to statistical shape modelling and shape analysis. This will have a positive impact on anatomical education and student retention because it will provide students with a broader range of sample variability information which will decrease pervading biases in medical training that result from small, limited sample sizes, and improve medical training. Project Narrative Dissection is a critical component of anatomy education but is limited due to the infrastructure required by the institution, the amount of variability in the available specimens, and the limited number of specimens available within the course. Biomedical imaging and analysis can be used to supplement dissection, allowing for an expansion in the number of anatomical specimens that students can observe and the amount of clinically relevant material that is available to students to improve their understanding of pathology and variation. This will expand student exposure to anatomical variation, produce more proficient medical professionals, and improve anatomy research.",Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans,10141430,F31EB030904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood coagulation', 'Buffaloes', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Exposure to', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandible', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Preservation Technique', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'education research', 'feature extraction', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'non-invasive imaging', 'posters', 'preservation', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'retention rate', 'segmentation algorithm', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,F31,2021,30805
"Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference MIPS XIX brings together an international community of experts from different fields including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, all investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new trainees and young researchers in a dedicated multidisciplinary forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XIX is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Karla Evans, PhD (University of York Psychology) and Mark McEntee, PhD (University College Cork Clinical Therapies); and committee (University of York) trainee member Emma Raat. It will run July 19-21, 2021 at the Novatel York Centre located near the University of York campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XIX, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus themes are 1) Improving Diagnostic & Screening Performance (or outcomes) in Radiology Using Human & Machine Expertise and 2) Technological & Human Interventions for Enhancing Medical Image Perception. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XIX. To date, 122 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together diverse researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 122 trainees have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference,10235401,R13EB031602,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malpractice', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physician&apos', 's Role', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder prevention', 'health care quality', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,10000
"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2021 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field, with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision, image processing and machine learning for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer- assisted interventions & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years and reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series also includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40% in 2020). The MICCAI 2021 Conference will be held in Strasbourg, France from September 27th to October 1st, 2021. MICCAI 2022 and MICCAI 2023 will be held in Singapore and Vancouver, Canada, respectively. Since 2018, a Mentoring Program is also part of the conference to connect students and early investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of the Women in MICCAI committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student and early investigator travel and registration awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations. Project narrative MICCAI is the premier meeting in the medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted intervention (CAI) communities, having introduced several landmark papers and providing a springboard for young scientists to establish themselves in the field. This proposal requests funds to provide travel awards for students and early investigators to present their work with focus on minority groups and underrepresented populations, providing them with an opportunity for visibility in an established international audience, foster professional development and collaborations.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'combustible tobacco', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging A Data Science Workshop (DSW) hosted at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) originated as a small gathering of local scientific computing specialists to share techniques and methods. However, as high-throughput data generation and AI/ML have gained prominence, there has been greatly increased demand from non-specialists, including PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose work mostly entails bench biology, for introductory and intermediate training in all aspects of data acquisition, storage, and analysis. They are generally computer-savvy already and able to program to some degree, and their interest is in short, hands-on demonstrations of how to apply AI/ML methods to data either generated or accessible via their research. The interest in data science classes is growing at OUHSC, but this need is still not met. Currently, the DSW is a volunteer effort, and the nascent OUHSC data science curriculum has minimal instruction on how to make data AI/ML ready or how to follow FAIR principles. This supplement will enable us to develop material on these topics and promulgate it via workshops, coursework, and freely accessible online content. Importantly, it will allow us to reach a much broader audience. Our recently formed Data Science Workshop (DSW) focuses on developing analysis capabilities in machine learning methods.

"ABCD Course on Reproducible Data Analyses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ABCD-ReproNim Course (1R25-DA051675) is a collaborative partnership to provide research educational training in reproducible analyses of data from the ABCD Study. The course integrates curriculum from ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, which is a NIBIB-funded P41 Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) whose vision is to help neuroimaging researchers achieve more reproducible data analysis workflows and outcomes. The ReproNim approach relies on both technical development of readily accessible, user-friendly computational tools and services that can be readily integrated into current research practices, as well as a broad educational outreach about reproducibility to the neuroimaging community at large, including developers as well as applied researchers across basic sciences and clinical disciplines. The current project proposes an administrative supplement to provide dedicated research training on making data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study FAIR (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and AI/ML (i.e., Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) ready. ML/AI applications have increased relevance in the discovery of biomarkers, predicting intervention outcomes, and integrating information across datasets. However, the knowledge required to perform effective biomedical ML research spans knowledge about data, scientific questions, computing technologies alongside ML/AI platforms and tools. The ABCD-ReproNim AI/ML Course will extend the current training to make trainees aware of the tools, concepts, and caveats for multimodal ML/AI processing of ABCD data. Students will first receive training across a 5-week online course that includes lectures, readings, and ABCD data exercises on topics that include: (1) FAIR for and FAIRness in ML/AI Applications, (2) Core Concepts in ML, (3), Neuroimaging ML, (4) Interpretable/Explainable ML, and (5) Introduction to Deep Learning. Competencies and skills addressed will include training and publishing ML models, organizing and evaluating data for ML applications, and reusing existing models efficiently. Didactic instruction will be followed by a 5-day remote Project Week, where students will apply the skills learned and work towards completion of AI/ML data analysis projects. Success will result in well-trained researchers who are able to apply reproducible AI/ML practices to test generalizability of AI/ML models for cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction across the ABCD dataset.

"Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data Project Summary Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non- stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. Of particular interest is the description of interactions among two or more brain areas. This application is for an administrative supplement to support an under-represented minority PhD student for two years. As documented by, among others, the National Science Foundation, people of African ancestry are severely under-represented in the sciences. The training provided to the candidate, under this supplement, would serve to elevate the candidate's research profile, and would ultimately contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce. The candidate's research concerns methods for identifying the flow of information from one brain area to another based on neural spike trains. Two major complications are, first, the noisiness of spike trains as conveyors of information and, second, the large numbers of neurons that must be considered simultaneously. Statistical methods developed very recently, through research supported by this grant, suggest very promising approaches to reducing the effects of noise and grappling with large networks of neurons. Based on these ideas, the candidate will develop a PhD thesis topic, and pursue it, with support from this supplement. Description of R01 and Candidate's Project Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, new recording and stimulation technologies have the potential to greatly accelerate mental health research, thereby improving dramatically the treatments offered to patients. Still, although there have been many important advances in mental health research and treatment, in no case is any mental health disorder well understood mechanistically. Faced with the reality that each promising discovery inevitably reveals new subtleties, a reasonable experimental goal is to be able to change behavior in desirable ways by modifying speciﬁc brain circuits [5, 8] and, in animals, technologies exist for circuit disruptions that are precise in both space and time [4, 7]. However, determining the best location and time for such disruptions to occur, with minimal off-target effects, requires far greater knowledge of circuits than currently exist: we need good characterizations of interactions among brain areas, including their timing relative to behavior. The over- arching aim of our research is to provide statistical methods for describing the ﬂow of information, based on evolving neural activity, among multiple areas of the brain during behavioral tasks. Neurophysiologists are starting to apply methods that can lead to breakthroughs, but the resulting data are complicated, and carefully-crafted statistical methods are needed. The research conducted under this grant over the past 18 years has helped lay the foundation for major advances through steady, systematic investigation of variability in neural signals and construction of new techniques. Our approach applies the knowledge accumulated in the discipline of statistics to the special circumstances of neurophysiology. The primary way neurons communicate is through rapid electrical discharges known as spikes, and se- quences of spikes are known as spike trains. A major focus of attention is the rate at which a neuron is ﬁring, and the way that rate varies with experimental conditions and behaviors. We and others have been trying to understand better the ﬁring rate ﬂuctuations among spike trains recorded simultaneously from many neurons, across multiple regions of the brain. Because each spike occurs over the course of roughly 1 mil- lisecond while behavior occurs over hundreds of milliseconds, it is reasonable to consider a spike train to be a stochastic sequence of isolated points in time which, in probability and statistics, is called a point process. Early theoretical research on point processes relied on an assumption of steady-state time-invariance, known as stationarity. Every behavioral setting, however, creates constantly-evolving neural activity. The origin of this grant in 2001 was our outline of a simple and tractable approach to neural spike train analysis that accommodates evolving, non-stationary activity. It has become a standard tool, and much of our research is based on similar point process statistical models except now, to describe complicated settings, they are much more elaborate. We also analyze and study local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), which result from all the neural currents gener- ated near the electrode (roughly within 150-200 microns), involving large numbers of neurons [3, 6]. The response of an LFP to varying conditions is less discriminative than individual neurons, but its power (vari- ability) can reveal situations in which a neural population is active, and it has been shown to correlate substantially with the BOLD fMRI signal [11, 12]. LFPs are especially useful for studying the role of oscillating neural circuits. Oscillations appear during many cognitive tasks, and changes in power and os- cillatory coupling have been associated with cognitive impairment [2, 10, 14]. Some of our research has been investigating the sources of LFPs in the cerebral cortex which, using biophysically-informed models, can be inferred to originate in particular cortical layers, thereby supplying important additional detail about dynamics and function [1, 9, 13]. Our Speciﬁc Aim 1 concerns (a) a new, putatively more accurate method of attributing LFPs to cortical sources, which allows us to explore cross-area interactions in greater detail than previously possible, (b) 1 simultaneous analysis of large numbers of LFPs, including those coming from two or more brain areas, and (c) identiﬁcation of oscillatory interactions from multiple brain areas. Speciﬁc Aim 2 concerns (a) simulta- neous analysis of large numbers of spiking neurons, (b) identiﬁcation of cross-correlation among brain areas based on large numbers of spiking neurons within each area, and (c) methods for analysis of precisely-timed synchronous (or nearly synchronous) spiking events, possibly in conjunction with oscillatory signals that are apparent in LFPs. Speciﬁc Aim 3 concerns (a) the combined assessment of interactions that occur at multiple timescales, (b) methods for relating large numbers of LFPs, which evolve across time, to behavior, and (c) creation of a simulation system based on realistic ground-truth models to test our methods. The candidate to be supported by the requested supplement, Tolani Olarinre, is now starting his third year in the joint Machine Learning and Statistics PhD program. We anticipate his ﬁnishing in 3 years, i.e., August 2024. Olarinre's research falls under our Speciﬁc Aim 2 (parts 2A and 2B), which concerns coordinated activity of spiking neurons across brain regions. When information appears to ﬂow from one brain region to another, the time lag may be short, under 10 milliseconds. One way to track ﬂow of information is to look for trial- to-trial variations, and see whether they tend to be consistent across regions. There are simple ways to try to do this, but it turns out they don't work: individual neural spike trains behave much like the simplest point processes, Poisson processes (they are different, but similar), with the consequence that the precise spike timing is unpredictable and, as a result, spike trains provide very noisy representations of evolving neural ﬁring rates. One important component of our research has been to devise methods for reducing the effects of this Poisson-like noise. For example, if two brain regions are coordinated, when activity in one region occurs earlier than average, activity in the other region should tend to occur earlier than average. Olarinre has been working with another graduate student and, based on their work, we have documented the failure of simple methods for identifying this kind of information ﬂow. On the other hand, sophisticated statistical methods succeed in ﬁnding it. We expect to submit a manuscript for publication within the next few months. A major complexity involves the large numbers of neurons recorded within a region, and the possible in- teractions they may have among themselves. A now-standard way to identify such interactions, based on point process statistical modeling, is to put into the model “coupling” terms to measure the inﬂuence of one neuron on another. A former student, Neil Spencer, who recently defended his PhD under Kass's super- vision, has developed very interesting computationally-efﬁcient methods for examining these interactions using network models. We have realized, however, that models with standard coupling terms suffer from the curse of Poisson-like noise. Thus, to be maximally effective they need to be modiﬁed. In outline we know what modiﬁcations to make, but devising a good algorithm and implementation will be challenging. This is a main part of the project Olarinre will next take up and, because novel method and implementation development of this kind requires a lot of time, it will most likely take him through 2022, so that during the Spring semester of 2023 he will be able to propose a thesis topic that includes network models and applies them to key problems. Spencer has acquired world-level expertise in cutting-edge Bayesian computation and he has agreed to collaborate with Olarinre by suggesting approaches, and modiﬁcations when the need arises, which will be very helpful. A letter from Dr. Spencer is provided with this application. In Olarinre's detailed work to date, he has found a wide diversity of neural responses within small regions of cortex. One of the problems he plans to investigate is the role of distinguishable subclasses of neurons. This would require, ﬁrst, methods of deﬁning these subclasses based on physiology (spiking patters), with consideration of anatomical location (cortical layer). Other key problems are to describe the role of thalamic 2 input, and the variability of network behavior across animals. The latter problem will require development of additional new, computationally-intensive methods. The methods Tolani develops should provide new insights into brain network activity. His thesis will likely include contributions to all of these problems, and will thereby yield far more speciﬁc descriptions than currently exist of the way neurons in a particular brain region interact in order to ”package” the information that gets communicated. Mentoring Experience of PI The PI, Kass, has extensive experience mentoring trainees. Within the Department of Statistics he served as graduate advisor before becoming Department Head, a position he held for 9 years. He was involved in a series of 4 NSF training grants (and was PI on 3), across 17 years, all of which had mentoring as a major component. In those capacities he created, supervised, and participated in both group and individual mentoring programs. Kass subsequently served for 3 years as Interim Head of the department-like structure now called the Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon (CMU), and was concurrently the interim CMU- side Co-Director of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is an umbrella organization run jointly by CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. In that role he supervised graduate training in the very large non-degree program (just under 150 students enrolled, steady-state), which supplements disciplinary PhD training as a certiﬁcated add-on. During Kass's time as Department Head in Statistics he visited Morehouse College in an attempt to ﬁnd ways Carnegie Mellon could be helpful in supplementing the training of students from HBCUs. Out of that came a very successful summer program in basic statistics for those students interested in public health. From 2001 to 2007 we trained 33 students from 19 institutions. Many have gone on to very successful careers including advanced degrees, and we would like to think they were served well by being able to analyze and interpret data with conﬁdence (one became President of the Eastern North America branch of the Biometric Society). Kass has also been PI of an NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research training grant in computational neuro- science, which is now commencing its 15th year. Our version of the NIH Blueprint training in computational neuroscience has had an important additional component, a 10-week summer program for undergraduates, typically rising seniors. The program is not aimed primarily at URMs, but we have tried to recruit them during a selective admissions process. Over the past 8 years we trained 18 URM students (just under 25% of the total). The training begins with 2 weeks of background lectures together with supervised computational labs, and this is followed by 8 weeks of research as a member of a faculty lab group. Our goal has been to give these students the kind of exciting and productive research experience that would encourage them to apply to graduate school in areas related to computational neuroscience, while also getting them better pre- pared to do so. The program has been run by a faculty member devoted to this project (for summer support); Kass has served not only as the PI of the program but also as an active participant, delivering lectures and supervising 1 or 2 undergraduate trainees himself each summer. Training and Career Development Plan Primary Mentoring Having gotten to know Olarinre over these past 2.5 years, Kass is aware of his unusual strengths and also the challenges he faces. Olarinre now has good training in graduate level statistics and machine learning. He also has an unusually strong background in software engineering (having worked at Intel for 5 years). There are, however, occasional holes in his background, and his progress is somewhat slower than many other students here (Carnegie Mellon attracts its share of the very top students in statistics and machine learning internationally). As a consequence, in addition to weekly group meetings that Kass 3 and Olarinre will attend, (i) Kass will meet with Olarinre, individually, at least once a week, and sometimes more often, (ii) Kass's review of Olarinre's progress will be continual (i.e., at least weekly), (iii) Kass will not assume Olarinre has absorbed aspects of research and professional development unless they have been assessed, and (iv) Kass and Olarinre will have frequent discussions about future publication plans, presentation plans, and PhD program milestone plans; from time to time they will also talk about career goals, and strategies for achieving them. Research Methods As we said, Olarinre's courses have provided him the foundational theory and meth- ods for statistical machine learning (he will be ﬁnished with coursework at the end of this semester). Be- coming an effective researcher in this area requires, in addition, (a) detailed understanding of results from the neuroscience literature, and their experimental contexts; ( b) appreciation of aspects of data collection, including pre-processing steps, that might affect analysis and conclusions; (c) strong cross-disciplinary com- munication skills; (d) an ability to collaborate with other analysts, ranging from postdoctoral researchers to undergraduates; (e) the knowledge and willingness to “break” statistical models in order to evaluate their applicability to the problem at hand; (f) a clear appreciation of what statistical models can and can not accomplish; and (g) the ability to envision a uniﬁed analytical evaluation built from many different compo- nents, and to develop a convincing explanatory description of the work. These elements of research methods provide a checklist for Kass in assessing Olarinre's progress. Assessment comes from probing discussions during individual meetings, as well as the written summaries of work that Kass will require before each weekly meeting (described below). Instruction for Olarinre will come from feedback, but will be reinforced by general comments—not directed at speciﬁc individuals—in group meetings. In addition, component skills in research methods are apparent in oral presentations, writing for publication, and writing to meet the requirements of PhD program milestones. Individual meetings with Kass Olarinre will present his work in a structured form. Prior to each meeting, Olarinre will send to Kass a short document that contains key ﬁgures and equations, together with very concise explanations and conclusions; it will also include any concerns and queries he might have, and his thoughts on next steps, mainly for the following week. All points of summary and interpretation will have to be presented as whole-sentence bullet points, and all ﬁgures must have detailed captions to make them largely self-contained. Kass has found the whole-sentence bullet points, especially, to be an extremely useful device for trainees: it forces them to articulate a series of ideas that express, conceptually, their key ﬁndings and observations. This special format has challenged Olarinre, as it does many students—it's easy to avoid following the format when rushed, but the beneﬁts are improved communication, together with development of a skill that will serve him well for future oral and written presentations. By including next steps, in writing, he will habituate his planning process. As he reviews the previous week's plans together with their current week's results, Olarinre will gain conﬁdence in his progress. Furthermore, such documents can grow relatively easily into manuscripts. Kass emphasizes the importance of writing, and will guide Olarinre toward clarifying the structure and style of his written work, in conjunction with improving its substance. Mentoring topics and timeline In addition to the speciﬁcs of research, and its presentation, the mentoring that Kass will provide to Olarinre will include multiple topics. We have structured these again in a kind of check-list format (like the multiple aspects of research methods) and, in addition, have laid out a detailed timeline for them, in tabular form. The topics are explained brieﬂy, following the table itself. 4  21 Su 21 F 22 S 22 Su 22 F 23 S 23 Su 23 F 24 S 24 Su Milestones X X X Publications X X X X  Meetings X X X X  Teaching X X  Writing Skills X X X X X X  Presentation Skills X X X X X X X X X X Grant Writing X X  Reviewing X X  Time Management X X X X  Ethics X X X  Jobs X X X  Meet with Brown X X  Program milestones: These include ﬁnishing, presenting, and writing up an Advanced Data Analysis project in Fall 2021, the thesis proposal, in the summer of 2023; and the thesis defense in the summer of 2024. The Advanced Data Analysis project must involve a major cross-disciplinary effort (at least 12 months) and Olarinre must have an external co-advisor in addition to Kass. Olarinre's research has been done in collaboration with Dr. Joshua Siegle at the Allen Brain Institute. Dr. Siegle provided a letter of collaboration for the most recent grant application submission, and he will serve as formal co-advisor. Pub- lications: We anticipate 3 publications from the thesis, with the ﬁrst being based on the Advanced Data Analysis project; initial work on the ﬁrst paper will begin by the end of this summer, after which Olarinre will focus entirely on ﬁnishing the research and presenting it, with the paper being completed and submitted during Spring 2022. Work on the second paper will occur in conjunction with the thesis proposal in Spring 2023, while the third paper will be written in time for its incorporation into the thesis itself, in Spring 2024. Meetings: Olarinre will attend and present results at multiple meetings, including the 2022 international meeting on Statistical Analysis of Neural Data (SAND10), the 2023 meeting on computational and systems neuroscience (COSYNE), and the 2023 Joint Statistical Meeting. This latter is the largest statistical meeting in the world, and one of the best opportunities for networking. At all of these meetings Kass will make sure Olarinre is “plugged in,” by introducing him to researchers at different levels of seniority who share his interests. In 2024 Olarinre will attend at least one additional meeting, possibly the annual meeting of the biometric society (ENAR) during the Spring. Teaching: Large undergraduate enrollments at institutions like CMU have made teaching assistants essential to delivery of most courses offered by departments like Statistics & Data Science. Since our ﬁrst NSF training grant in 1996, Kass has recognized a much broader importance of TAing and related experiences to the development of graduate students in statistics. One of the pillars in our understanding is the recognition that much the same skills are used when teaching as when communicating technical material to less technical collaborators. Thus, regardless of Olarinre's ultimate career path, he will be served well by understanding what makes teachers effective, and by guided practice. Olarinre will serve as TA during Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. (While he is TAing, Olarinre will not be supported by this supplement.) Because he is in the joint PhD program with Machine Learning, he is expected to serve as a TA for one of their courses and one of the courses offered by Statistics & Data Science. We are very fortunate to have here at CMU a leading center for teaching, the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, the director of which, who holds a PhD in cognitive psychology, Kass collaborated with extensively early in her career. The center is a national leader in the formulation of good practices for undergraduate teaching and is unusual in its explicit use, in its many programs and materials, of high-quality research in educational psychology. The Eberly Center offers a series of workshops for graduate students, which Olarinre will at- 5 tend. Writing Skills: In addition to what we have already said, the timeline indicates when attention will be focused on document production. Presentation Skills: This is continual, through group presentations. Kass will review slides and provide feedback during practice sessions for all milestones and professional meeting presentations. Grant writing: Kass will go over with the NeuroStats group the process of grant writing, and with Olarinre individually as preparation for his thesis proposal and for his postdoctoral job search. On these occasions Olarinre will produce a short mock grant proposal, including speciﬁc aims, that Kass and others will critique. Reviewing: Kass is frequently asked to review articles for publication in leading journals and almost always asks a trainee to serve as a co-reviewer. Olarinre will get the chance to review such articles on at least two occasions, planned for summer of 2022 and 2023, as those are times with minimal additional responsibilities for him. Kass will guide him through the process. This is also a general topic that comes up in our NeuroStats research group, so discussions there (with several faculty) will reinforce best practices. Time management: Kass will review with Olarinre his strategies and tactics for time management, especially when key deadlines are looming. Ethics: Kass will discuss ethical issues with Olarinre as they arise naturally during the interdisciplinary collaboration and publication process. In addition, formal sessions will occur in the NeuroStats group. Topics Kass plans to discuss, and has discussed with other groups previously, include individual responsibilities when working together as a team across se- niority levels; determining authorship; plagiarism and acknowledgment of previous work; responsibility to publish; redundancy or duplication of publications; integrity in reporting statistical results; careful attention to statistical assumptions; making data and code available; intellectual property involving novel methodol- ogy; accuracy, acknowledgment of previous results, and responsibility to educate during oral presentations; conﬁdentiality and impartiality in reviewing the work of others; honest representation of work, accuracy of budgets, and responsible use of funds in grant proposals; types of scientiﬁc misconduct; complexity of typ- ical scenarios; responsibility and appropriate channels for reporting. Sessions are planned for each Spring, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Job hunting: Kass will ask several former trainees to discuss with the NeuroStats group their experiences, including types of jobs, interview preparation, honest representation of self, and the problem of assessing the multiple trade-offs among alternatives. These sessions are planned for each Fall, 2021, 2022, 2023. Kass will of course also discuss all of these topics with Olarinre when it is time for him to begin his search for his next position, presumably as a postdoctoral fellow. Additional Mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown Olarinre will be mentored primarily by Kass, with some supplementary mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown, at MIT. Brown has had a long-term collaboration with Kass (they wrote two highly-cited review papers on statistics in neurophysiology as well as an inﬂuential paper on graduate training in statistics). Brown is unusually accomplished: he is an MD-PhD, the only person to hold endowed chairs at both MIT and Harvard Medical School, a member of all 3 National Academies, and he is the 2020 winner of the Swartz Prize in Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neu- roscience. Brown is deeply interested in the research topics Olarinre is pursuing and he is also himself an unusually successful mentor, including of trainees from under-represented groups. Dr. Brown, who is African-American, has also been very involved in diversity efforts at MIT and Harvard Medical School. The additional wisdom and advice Dr. Brown can offer Olarinre will be invaluable. A letter of collaboration for this special purpose is supplied with our application. Speciﬁcally, Brown has agreed to listen to Olarinre give a formal presentation, give him feedback, and discuss with him his goals and progress toward them. This will occur in Spring 2022, before Olarinre gives his ﬁrst presentation at the SAND10 meeting, and again in Summer 2023 in preparation for Olarinre's attendance and presentation at the Joint Statistical Meeting. At that time Brown will also talk to Olarinre about job search, which will be commencing. 6",Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10378845,R01MH064537,"['Academy', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Authorship', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Career Choice', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Duplicate Publication', 'Educational Psychology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Group Processes', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'North America', 'Occupations', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Plagiarism', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prize', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Running', 'STEM career', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientific Misconduct', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive task', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'experience', 'falls', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'individual responsibility', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lectures', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'millisecond', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'student training', 'summer program', 'teacher', 'teaching assistant', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'willingness']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,72228
"FAIR Data Competency and Machine Learning Readiness for Biomedical Scientists Project Summary/Abstract The Academic Science Education and Research Training (ASERT) program for postdoctoral scholars at the University of New Mexico (UNM) matches PhD graduates with outstanding biomedical research mentors and engages New Mexico’s diverse populations through effective science education collaborations with minority serving institution (MSI) and national tribal college partners.

"Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY This Idaho INBRE Administrative Supplement will establish a collaboration between an INBRE-Developmental Research Program Investigator, S Long, and an IDeA co-funded R01 principle investigator, D Mitchell. Dr. Long is a computer scientist with expertise in machine learning and computer-assisted image analyses. Dr. Mitchell is a cell biologist/immunologist with expertise in retinal development/regeneration. The project is titled, ‘Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration’. There are three Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1. Develop a collaboration between the two investigators to enhance both projects and  increase undergraduate student research opportunities.  Specific Aim 2: Determine the requirement for selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal  development and regeneration.  Specific Aim 3: Develop an image analysis pipeline to support zebrafish retinal analyses. Microglia are the resident phagocytes in the central nervous system and engulf and degrade pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris. In addition, these cells may be involved in retinal degenerative disease, injury, homeostasis, development, regeneration, and/or crosstalk with Müller glia. The Mitchell laboratory did transcriptome analysis of microglia/macrophage populations isolated from regenerating zebrafish retinas. From this, a shortlist of five microglia-expressed genes of interest are identified. Zebrafish mutant lines are, or will be, established for each gene. Real-time live confocal imaging will be done on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous zebrafish lines to record microglial dynamics in developing or regenerating retinas. The Long laboratory will develop an image analysis pipeline to automate the interpretation of the large datasets from these experiments. The analyses will quantify microglia numbers and morphology, cell death, Müller glial proliferation, hypertrophy, migration of daughter cells, and expression of neural progenitor markers. The machine learning techniques developed by the Long laboratory will relieve the bottleneck and potential biases in analysis of large image datasets from the Mitchell laboratory and allow rapid testing of microglia gene function. Strong preliminary data and investigator expertise indicate that this team will complete the proposed work. The Long-Mitchell collaboration will provide a continuum of research opportunities for students by delivering broadened student research experiences. Dr. Long has the expertise and the environment to propel students into Data Science, a needed complement for modern biological research. Undergraduate students will be supported in both the Long laboratory at the primarily undergraduate institution, Lewis-Clark State College, and the Mitchell laboratory at the research-intensive, University of Idaho. PROJECT NARRATIVE This collaboration expands two projects currently supported by INBRE and an IDeA co-funded R01, into an interdisciplinary effort to probe specific microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration using computer-assisted image analyses. The investigators bring expertise in molecular biology and computer science, respectively.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950
"IPREP: IUPUI Graduate Preparation for the Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences. IPREP Project Summary The IUPUI Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (IPREP) will provide academic enhancement and extensive research experiences to prepare talented college graduates from diverse backgrounds for success in rigorous Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. programs in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Six students will be recruited annually from historically black colleges and universities, predominantly Hispanic serving institutions and tribal colleges as well as from a pool of high performing underrepresented minority students from existing IUPUI programs. IPREP Fellows will begin the pro- gram on June 1st each year with a one-week orientation where their skills and needs will be assessed, and from which a detailed personal development plan will be established. Weeks 2-7 will be two-week rotations in three labs chosen by the Fellows. Every IPREP Fellow will then be paired with an experienced research mentor with active sponsored research, who will incorporate the student as a paid employee into their research enterprise. IPREP Fellows will receive additional ongoing support from the IUPUI Center for Research and Learning that will include individualized advising, assistance in preparing graduate school applications, planning for graduate school visits and interviews, as well as monthly monitoring and reporting of progress to the Program Director. IPREP Fellows will leave the program with enhanced laboratory and research sills, including improved abilities to ask and solve research questions (critical thinking), increased understanding of expectations of graduate programs, awareness of process for seeking external funding for graduate education, improved self-confidence and ability to succeed in a competitive academic environment. At least five of the six IPREP Fellows will be successful in obtaining admission to rigorous Ph.D. and Ph.D./M.D. programs and will successfully complete their graduate/professional programs. Project Narrative The long-term goal of the IUPUI Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (IPREP) is to improve diversity in the community of graduate students and faculty for five targeted Ph.D. programs in the STEM area at IUPUI. Training will be available for 6 students each year in areas of interest to the national health including basic medical sciences, clinical psychology, addictions neuroscience, human performance, and medical neuro-science toward the goal of matriculation into these graduate programs, or similar graduate programs at other universities.

"Biomarker discovery of Alzheimer's disease trajectory using NMR platform ABSTRACT  In response to the NOT-GM-21-028, we are submitting a supplement to our parent R01 5R01GM120033-05 to fund a summer undergraduate student from Rice University who has been accepted to Baylor College of Medicine Summer Undergraduate Research Training (SMART) program.  Within our R01 award, we are developing two powerful new automated algorithms to capture biomarkers of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Both of these tools capitalize on recent developments in machine learning; one of them, NMRQuant, has already been validated on simulated and phantom nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and is ready to be applied to biological samples. We propose to examine the plasma samples obtained from the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), which prospectively collects demographic, environmental, neuropsychosocial, and genetic data along with the biofluid samples, in consecutive 1-year follow-up analyses that track various health outcomes. The undergraduate student will spend 10 weeks in the lab as part of SMART program and will examine 30 AD plasma samples for biomarkers of disease using NMR and our new algorithms. Baylor College of Medicine approved in-lab training of SMART students. Thus, within the lab, the student will learn necessary procedures when dealing with human samples, new technologies such as NMR, and computational analyses. Through the SMART program, the student will expand her academic knowledge and career planning via structured daily seminars. She will also present her progress and data to the lab and to the SMART program. This work will thus bring transformative knowledge to her future career of a physician/scientist. NARRATIVE This application seeks to funding for a summer undergraduate student to expand her technical, academic, and career planning knowledge through in-lab bench work, computational training, and structured SMART program career training at Baylor College of Medicine. Building on our new NMR tools developed through our parent R01 award, the undergraduate student will examine plasma, obtained from a cohort of prospectively followed healthy individuals and those with AD through the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), for NMR-based metabolomics biomarkers, to shed new light on the AD sub-phenotypes toward discovery of precision biomarkers of the disease.",Biomarker discovery of Alzheimer's disease trajectory using NMR platform,10394015,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Rice', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'college', 'follow-up', 'laboratory experience', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool', 'undergraduate research', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,10805
"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10203815,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2021,10000
"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Speed', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'models and simulation', 'molecular modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein structure function', 'ribosome profiling', 'simulation', 'transcriptome', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'efficacy evaluation', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,750000

"Cherokee Nation Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) 11 Abstract Major health disparities continue to impact tribal nations, yet a serious shortage of scientists conducting American Indian (AI) health disparities research persists. For several years, Cherokee Nation, the University of Oklahoma (OU) system, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) have partnered to address this issue by building tribal research capacity through the Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) mechanism. In this cycle of NARCH funding, the partnership among Cherokee Nation, OU, and OMRF continues and, importantly for student career enhancement, expands to include the Oklahoma State University (OSU) system as a key partner for student career enhancement activities. The overall mission of Cherokee NARCH is to develop durable research capacity within the context of an American Indian (AI) tribal nation to address health disparities. To achieve this goal, the five Specific Aims of Cherokee NARCH are: 1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a Leadership Team (LT) and a Tribal-Campus  Advisory Committee (TCAC), that ensures integration of career enhancement, capacity building, and  research activities; 2. to educate the next generation of researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the  context of tribal research, focusing on undergraduate, graduate and health professions students; 3. to build tribal capacity by developing a set of research codes to govern the conduct of genomic and other  biomedical research predicated on the concept of tribal data sovereignty; 4. to conduct innovative research and pilot research capable of seeding future research projects  performed by researchers seeking to work within the Cherokee Nation setting; and 5. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of student career enhancement,  capacity building, and research/pilot research projects, and evaluation of the overall Cherokee NARCH program. Cherokee NARCH provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in health disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens Cherokee NARCH by its remarkable success in the education of AI students in scientific and health professions fields, including the advent of the first tribally affiliated medical school in the US. Cherokee NARCH therefore provides an unprecedented environment in which a tribe, two research-intensive universities with large AI student populations (OU and OSU), and a biomedical research foundation (OMRF) will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable disparities in health that continue to affect AI people. / Narrative American Indian communities suffer disproportionately from a range of health disparities. Cherokee NARCH will expand authentic tribal capacity to address these disparities through a coordinated program of student career enhancement, capacity building, and research/pilot research activities directly providing research experiences for students in the Cherokee Nation setting. /",Cherokee Nation Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) 11,10223765,S06GM142119,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American Indians', 'Bariatrics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cherokee Indian', 'Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Occupations', 'Health Services', 'Health Surveys', 'Immersion', 'Indigenous', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Native American Research Center for Health', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oklahoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteopathic Medicine', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reservations', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Training', 'Tribes', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bariatric surgery', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'ethical legal social implication', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'next generation', 'programs', 'success', 'tribal Nation', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,CHEROKEE NATION,S06,2021,28875
"Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM Project Summary/ Abstract Prisms of Reality seeks to develop and assess the impact and feasibility of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) learning platform that targets high-leverage pain points in the secondary math and science curriculum to support a more diverse and well-equipped healthcare workforce. Our platform engages students in self-directed scientific inquiry using compelling real world contexts that develop empirical decision-making skills with regards to key issues in public health. In Phase I, we will design an IVR learning module for high school Algebra that emphasizes how mathematical modeling of ultraviolet rays using trigonometric functions can be applied to reason quantitatively about the risks posed by ozone depletion, which led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In the face of ever changing climate change regulations, our module will ensure students are capable of flexibly applying quantitative models in support of policies that advance public health outcomes while improving proficiency on math and science skills that preclude so many from continuing their education in STEM, specifically in the medical fields. There is evidence that IVR increases motivation and engagement, but applications in learning that empirically improve student outcomes have proven to be elusive. Therefore, the development of a pedagogical framework in IVR that leads to enduring understanding and increased achievement will be ground-breaking for STEM teaching and learning. Our platform employs constructivist, gamified narratives that foster “hands on” student discovery and 3D sense-making of natural phenomena and mathematical models tied to public health issues. Through holistic data collection and analytics, our teacher-facing learning management system will track each student’s conceptual progress and provide individualized feedback. If successful, Prisms’ platform will not only transform the student experience and achievement, but will provide a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualized through IVR to yield meaningful student outcomes. To develop the platform, in Phase I Prisms will a) design a robust game-based pedagogical framework that harnesses innovative features unique to VR to cultivate deep conceptual flexibility and abstract reasoning skills based on authentic real world problems; b) explore effective VR functionalities, experience design, and development techniques for high quality implementation using the cost-effective Oculus Quest; c) implement a teacher-facing learning management system that will provide teachers data-driven insights about student learning in order to support individualized feedback and intervention; and d) evaluate productive user experience & empirically measure our platform’s impact on learning outcomes in authentic classroom settings. Project Narrative The goal of our Phase I research is to iteratively design and rigorously evaluate the impact of an immersive virtual reality learning module in demonstrating how mathematical modelling and reasoning can support the implementation of public health policies like the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which mitigated increased rates in skin cancer, cataracts and other genetic damages due to ozone depletion. Students have often been susceptible to the misuse of quantitative models, which our platform will address through immersive opportunities for students to engage with interdisciplinary, real world problems that impact individual and collective health. Ultimately, we aim to empower a diverse and technically versatile healthcare workforce, while ensuring that all students are equipped with the tools necessary to make empirical decisions about the public health issues of today and the future.","Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM",10252740,R43GM142301,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algebra', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Cataract', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Policy', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Ozone', 'Pain', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quantitative Reasoning', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Self-Direction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visualization', 'algebraic concepts', 'base', 'climate change', 'cloud based', 'constructivism', 'cost effective', 'dashboard', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high school', 'improved', 'individualized feedback', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning outcome', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical sciences', 'mathematical theory', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'personalized learning', 'skills', 'sound', 'student participation', 'teacher', 'technique development', 'tool', 'trigonometry', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIGMS,PRISMS OF REALITY INC.,R43,2021,246773
"A Novel Device for Training and Evaluating Ultrasound-Guided Procedures In Anesthesia Project Summary The use of ultrasound for interventional guidance has expanded significantly over the past decade and has become an important tool in clinical specialties such as Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine and Sports Medicine. In interventional ultrasound, there are significant challenges introduced by the necessity of simultaneously visualizing the target and the needle with a single B-mode probe, keeping the nondominant hand steady while finding the correct trajectory of the needle in the dominant hand. The resulting alignment problem (probe, instrument, target) is a different skill problem than identifying structures in ultrasound and requires specialized training. Current training systems do not provide suitable information to aid the novice user in developing key hand-eye coordination skills and their retention. For this reason, we propose to design the EDU –comprised of an Interson ultrasound, a tablet computer with guidance software, a CGM Optical Head with tiny video cameras, and a CGM custom nerve block phantom-- as a learning platform for developing key skills in needle acquisition, accuracy of needle placement, and understanding needle-to-ultrasound-plane orientation. The use of tiny video cameras on the ultrasound enable computer algorithms to compute the trajectory differences between an experienced user performing one of the regional blocks and a student’s attempt. The differences between the paths to the target allow some quantification of the skills, which may be helpful in giving feedback to the student during the semester, and perhaps also to develop a benchmark for CME courses. A second aim of this proposal is to study whether learning with needle-guidance software is beneficial to student skill acquisition and/or confidence. This proposal would study a cohort of student registered nurse anesthetists during a semester course teaching five progressively more difficult nerve blocks/procedures. With this novel system, quantifiable metrics can be harnessed to demonstrate whether learning with guidance is helpful, even when the guidance is removed, and whether it can lead to more consistent procedures across students. Using proprietary custom- made phantoms, the progressive difficulty levels of the five procedures can show whether guidance can be more helpful in more difficult blocs or if it can help in all.

"The Behavioral Determinants of Metabolic Syndrome Risk Development in Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT As few as 23.3% of U.S. young adults 20 years and up are considered metabolically healthy, based on the absence of all traditional metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. Such risk factors are often asymptomatic and go undetected, clustering with other risk factors to increase future disease risk. Thus, early intervention to prevent MetS risk accrual is crucial and it is critical that behavioral interventions are tailored to specific populations. Accordingly, longitudinal research is needed to better understand the behavioral changes that lead to initial MetS risk development (behavioral determinants) and the motivating factors behind these behavioral changes in young adults. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a theoretically driven intervention for the primordial prevention of MetS risk development in college students. The overall objectives are to (i) identify the optimal behavioral targets for the prevention of MetS risk development and (ii) to identify the motivations behind such behaviors and develop a theoretical framework that will guide intervention design. The rationale for this project is that the identification of the behaviors that precede MetS risk development and a population-specific framework to explain such changes will enable the design of interventions in the early college years to reduce the future burden of cardiovascular disease by helping young adults to adopt positive behaviors that will likely track throughout life. To achieve these objectives, two specific aims will be pursued: 1) Identify the behavioral determinants of MetS risk development in young adults; and 2) Explore changes in psychosocial and environmental antecedents of observed behavioral change. Using a longitudinal observational design, 150 high school seniors will be observed over 15 months as they transition from local high schools to behavioral independence at colleges across the US. For the first aim, behavioral outcomes (physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, diet, and risk-related behaviors) will be assessed and MetS risk scores will be calculated using baseline traditional risk factor data. Change in risk scores and novel cardiovascular risk markers (e.g. aortic arterial stiffness) will be assessed immediately following year one of college, upon return to the local community. The second aim will be addressed at multiple levels of the ecological framework by assessing constructs such as the perceived environment, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and aspects of motivational theory such as behavioral self-regulation and self-efficacy. The approach is innovative as, in a population at-risk of initial MetS risk factor development or risk factor clustering, we propose the first comprehensive, longitudinal assessment of the relationship between behavior change and MetS risk, including both traditional and novel methodologies. Moreover, we propose to do so in an ecologically valid manner that assesses actual behavior change from the home environment to campuses across the country. The proposed research is significant as it will promote prevention of subsequent clinical disease, strengthen the institutional research environment by increasing future chances of grant funding, and provide multifaceted training experiences to student researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project has great public health value as, in a time where students face overwhelming public health messaging, it aims to identify population-specific behaviors that may put students at risk of developing cardiometabolic disease and to identify interventional strategies that will reduce barriers to the adoption of healthy behaviors. This is relevant to the NIH’s mission as the behavioral patterns developed during the college years tend to track into later adulthood, and understanding how best to educate and equip a population that are often unaware and unmotivated with the skills to self-manage their health will reduce the lifetime medical and economic burden of cardiovascular disease. Finally, this work will contribute to the development of the next generation of scholars and will inform grant applications to trial and scale such interventions nationally.",The Behavioral Determinants of Metabolic Syndrome Risk Development in Young Adults,10289913,R15HL159650,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiometabolic Disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Central obesity', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Economics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Motivation', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Social Adjustment', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral outcome', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'college', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'high school', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'motivated behavior', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'perceived stress', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'skills', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'training opportunity', 'twelfth grade', 'university student', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,ELON UNIVERSITY,R15,2021,388822
"Evaluation of the Be Vape Free Curriculum of the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs, vapes, ENDS) are the most widely used tobacco product among adolescents, aged 12-18. Despite clear connections between e-cigarette use, nicotine addiction, and physical and mental health outcomes, adolescents continue to harbor misperceptions about e-cigarettes, perpetuated by exposure to marketing and flavors, and a lack of understanding about their harms and addictive properties. While schools have historically provided a key venue in which to implement tobacco prevention programs, most school-based tobacco prevention programs focus on conventional cigarette smoking only, have had mixed results, and have several gaps in their educational content on e-cigarettes. Further, studies have rarely determined if there are specific groups for whom e-cigarette prevention and cessation programs are, and are not, helping. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we developed the “Be Vape-Free” Curriculum, a free 5-session school-based education, prevention, and reduction (de-escalation) program for middle and high school students. This curriculum is part of and includes the most effective components of the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, a free online comprehensive tobacco prevention program used by thousands of schools and educators across the United States, having reached more than 1.7 million middle and high schools students. Aligning with the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, we have addressed 3 of the 6 stages needed to adequately develop, evaluate, refine, and fully implement and disseminate our Be Vape-Free Curriculum. Thus, the Specific Aims of this project are to: (1) Determine whether the Be Vape-Free Curriculum is effective in increasing middle and high school students’ knowledge of e-cigarettes and resistance to using, and decreasing their positive attitudes towards and intentions to use e- cigarettes; (2) Determine whether the Be Vape-Free Curriculum is effective in changing middle and high school students’ actual use of e-cigarettes (including preventing initiation, continuation, escalation; encouraging decreased use and cessation; and use of e-cigarettes with other tobacco and marijuana products); and (3) Examine the heterogenous treatment effects (HTE) of the intervention, identifying both those who benefit the most and those who do not benefit from the curriculum. We will employ a cluster-randomized trial, stepped- wedge design, with 60 middle and 60 high schools in California (n=10,800 students). Schools will be randomized to either the treatment (Be Vape-Free Curriculum) or delay-in-treatment arm (i.e., standard health education first year and Be Vape-Free curriculum in second year), with all students followed for another 12 months. The timing of this proposed research is extremely important as we have outstanding momentum, have established an extensive team of school and community partners and stakeholders, have numerous schools already interested in using the Be Vape-Free Curriculum, and have garnered tremendous support from the California Department of Education and schools. Use of e-cigarettes has dramatically increased among adolescents; however, few prevention programs focusing on prevention and escalation of e-cigarettes have been developed, tested, or widely disseminated throughout the U.S. We have developed a novel Be Vape-Free school-based curriculum aimed at changing high school students’ attitudes towards, misperceptions about, intentions to use and actual use of e-cigarettes, which will be evaluated for changes in adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes, intentions and actual use.",Evaluation of the Be Vape Free Curriculum of the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit,10288652,R01CA263121,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Future Teacher', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Heart', 'High School Student', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Marijuana', 'Marketing', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Planning Theory', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Property', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wages', 'Youth', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'combustible cigarette', 'community based participatory research', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic cigarette use', 'follow-up', 'high school', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'junior high school', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical conditioning', 'positive youth development', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'skills', 'social media', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tobacco prevention', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'vaping']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,744008
