"2022 Chemistry & Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Summary/Abstract The 2022 Chemistry and Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference (CBP-GRC) will highlight the exciting diversity of peptide science. Attendees will engage in discussions regarding scientific discoveries, challenges and advances in the design, synthesis, characterization, and translation of peptides. We have created an innovative and cutting-edge program encompassing sessions focusing on recent developments in chemical biology and organic synthesis complemented with sessions covering topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), vaccine development, immunology, natural and unnatural products, advances in green chemistry, biosynthesis, and novel technologies. To engage the audience and promote discussion, session chairs will give an overview of the broader field in each session to bring the audience together before the session speakers deliver their lectures. Furthermore, to increase cross-talk amongst scientists, sessions including “peptide mash-up” and the “future of peptides” will bring together scientists from vastly different fields (e.g. green chemistry, drug discovery, and structural biology) in a single session encouraging and stimulating our attendees to think outside of their own scientific boxes and promote collaboration across multiple disciplines. In 2022, the successful and well attended Power Hour will continue, highlighting the challenges women and minorities are still facing, as well as discussing solutions and progress toward equity. Altogether, this conference provides a collegial environment where emerging scientists present their work alongside world leaders in the field and the conference is the highlight of the peptide community conference calendar. The graduate and postdoctoral student-run Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), held in conjunction with the related GRC, will provide opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to foster meaningful connections by discussing their research and networking with their peers. The student- facilitated seminar, as well as the poster session, are designed to foster communication between students and form relationships which are then leveraged at the GRC. In addition, the GRS includes a career panel in which three mid-to-late career professionals provide insights and strategies on various career paths. The objective of the CBP-GRC is to provide opportunities to deepen the impact of peptide science on healthcare and technology through scientific communication and collaboration while actively prioritizing a diversified community and the involvement of underrepresented minorities. This goal will be achieved by actively inviting speakers and session chairs from diverse backgrounds and career experience as well as developing a scientifically innovative and diverse program. Narrative Peptides are molecules integral to human biology and medicine that are exciting leads for the development of novel medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. This conference will bring together world-class leaders and early stage investigators to advance peptide research in the 21st century.",2022 Chemistry & Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,10314225,R13TR003934,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Calendar', 'Career Choice', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Technology', 'Hour', 'Human Biology', 'Immunology', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Nature', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccines', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'career', 'community involvement', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'new technology', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'structural biology', 'symposium', 'vaccine development']",NCATS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2021,30000
"Hawaii Data Science Training for RCMI Researchers Project Summary There is little doubt that biomedical science has become data intensive science. In the last decade, we have witnessed the booming of new biomedical technologies generate massive amounts of bio-data. This massive data includes various types of “omics”-data, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, petabytes of imaging, and so on. It is now feasible to access and mine the massive amount of clinical and phenotypic data. Data science skills involve how to use computational methods and algorithms to analyze, manage, and interpret different types of data, and require interdisciplinary knowledge such as biomedical domain knowledge, computational programming, statistics, and mathematics. Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) funded projects are often conducted in minority institutions and lack sufficient data science skills and data scientist experts to perform data intensive biomedical research. It is therefore essential to train data science skills for RCMI investigators. Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is difficult for Hawaii-based investigators studying health disparities to travel to the US continent to receive structured data science training and project-focused analytical support and interactive training. Hawaii investigators desperately need local data science trainers. The data science team at John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) University of Hawaii has rich experience in training data science skills to students and different levels of investigators, as well as supporting their data science needs in their research projects. In the proposal, we aim to train RCMI investigators with next generation data science skills. To reach the goal, we plan to accomplish the following aims. Aim 1: Provide education and training of data science-related skills to RCMI Researchers and their collaborators. Aim 2: Enhance collaborations between RCMI -funded researchers and data scientists. In addition to training RCMI investigators and their collaborators in a group in Aim 1, we will also offer individual data science training for investigators to foster collaborations between investigators and our data science experts. Project Narrative In the proposal, we aim to train investigators of Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI), who conduct health disparity research with next generation data science skills. To reach this, we will provide education and training of data science-related skills to RCMI Researchers and their collaborators. We will also conduct individual training to enhance collaborations between RCMI-funded researchers and data scientists.",Hawaii Data Science Training for RCMI Researchers,10452388,U54MD007601,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methylation', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer program', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'health disparity', 'investigator training', 'lectures', 'medical schools', 'microbiome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'petabyte', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'skills', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'training project', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U54,2021,317955
"Center for Live Cell Genomics ABSTRACT Center for Live Cell Genomics We will build new methodology and capacity for large-scale, long-term, inexpensive, modular, customizable, shared, Internet-of-Things-controlled, reproducible live cell culture and tissue-based experimental genomics disease models. Tissue models include traditional cell culture as well as organoid and primary tissue explants obtained from surgery or biopsy. Organoid factories supporting tissue growth and maintenance will be integrated with external and on-chip electro-optofluidic analytical modules to become part of an ecosystem that is modeled after open-source software. It will use commodity sensors, cameras, and computers linked in platforms flexibly designed using simple 3D printing, molding, etching and milling techniques potentially available at any institution. This will stimulate rapid innovation in experimental platforms for tissue culture. We will push this technology and use its best-in-class capabilities to make progress in neurodevelopment and pediatric cancer, addressing big questions. What genes contribute most importantly and specifically to human brain development? How do they go wrong in neurodevelopmental disease or brain injury? What specific molecular pathways are disrupted in individual pediatric cancer cases? How can we test pathway-specific treatments in a tissue model specific to each patient? Our education and outreach plans include a training program to develop a diverse and inclusive cohort of undergraduate students trained in genomic science through secondary school and community college outreach as well as coding workshops and research-based laboratory classes for UCSC undergraduates to develop core competencies. Participation in these activities serve as a basis for training graduate students and postdocs in inclusive pedagogy and mentorship. We are also developing a one-stop information hub to form an online community and to share our technology through immersive webinars and tutorials aimed at a broader audience with a range of expertise from the general public to scientists and clinicians at research institutions. Our work will enable significant advances in neuroscience and cancer research and education, stimulate a new open-source culture in cell biology and genomics, and democratize scientific and educational access beyond elite institutions, extending sharing projects like NHGRI ANvIL beyond data and code to include experiments and Internet-connected experimental platforms. Project Narrative We will introduce a new experimental platform paradigm to genomic studies of live cells and tissues that will allow scientists to be more creative, more productive, more collaborative and use fewer resources for their live cell genomics experiments. We will create new platforms that provide living cells growing in realistic 3D cultures that mimic actual tissues in the body and incorporate Internet-based remote control and analysis capabilities. We will deploy this technology to perform new, more robust and more reproducible experiments leading to discoveries in neurodevelopmental disease and cancer.",Center for Live Cell Genomics,10307037,RM1HG011543,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebrum', 'Childhood Glioma', 'Clinical Data', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'International', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Secondary Schools', 'Speed', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer education', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'community college', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'engineered stem cells', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genomic data', 'glioma cell line', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online community', 'online resource', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'outreach', 'pedagogy', 'petabyte', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'programs', 'remote control', 'response', 'scaffold', 'science education', 'screening', 'sensor', 'stem cells', 'stroke model', 'student training', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tissue culture', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'undergraduate student', 'webinar']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,RM1,2021,2506350
"CSHL Network Biology Conference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks support for the conference on Network Biology, to take place March/April 2021 to 2025, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This meeting, held in biannual rotation on the CSHL campus in New York, brings together senior and junior scientists from both experimental and computational laboratories with common interests in network biology. The meeting will emphasize new discoveries and provide an open forum for the presentation of the latest research and results on molecular networks and their relevance to normal and abnormal cellular physiology. It will be essential for advancing knowledge in all aspects of the network modeling process, from data generation in experimental cell biology to data analysis and computer simulation and from the development and validation of network models describing these data to biological inferences made from the models. The conference will include platform sessions on interaction networks, signaling and network dynamics, regulatory networks, computational tools, artificial intelligence and big data, multi-scale networks, networks and disease, networks in differentiation, microbiome networks, network evolution, synthetic networks, network engineering and networks beyond biology though the exact program for the meeting will be assembled after the abstract submission deadline in February 2021 and adapted to ongoing developments in the field in subsequent years. This conference will include significant components designed to facilitate the active participation of younger scientists such as selection of platform speakers on the basis of the scientific merit of their submitted abstracts as well as poster presentations, round tables, lightning talks and poster prizes. Distinguished speakers will also be invited to give platform talks and interact with more junior scientists. The intimate environment at CSHL fosters social interactions and active participation by all. The majority of participants to the previous CSHL Network Biology meeting expressed that they were “very satisfied”. Speakers' panels have consisted of at least 50% women; the gender balance will be maintained in future meetings. In the 2019 iteration of the meeting, a panel discussion was established to address the challenges of Women in Network Science. We will continue to address big community challenges though panel discussions in this meeting. In 2021, we will discuss Applicability and Translatability of Network Biology with panelists including network biologists whose work is deeply influential throughout the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biological systems are functionally and structurally formed by complex networks of interacting molecular components, many of which are encoded in the genome. Elucidating the structure and function of these networks and understanding how their dysregulation causes disease are critical steps toward improving human health. This application seeks support for the conference on Network Biology to be held every two years in March/April 2021-25 at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, to bring together experimental and computational biologists and discuss emerging trends and latest results in the field.",CSHL Network Biology Conference,10137390,R13HG011550,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular biology', 'Chalk', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Influentials', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Lightning', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nationalities', 'New York', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Plants', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Process', 'Property', 'Published Comment', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rotation', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data exchange', 'data reuse', 'design', 'graduate student', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'senior faculty', 'social', 'symposium', 'trend', 'unpublished works']",NHGRI,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R13,2021,3000
"The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR Project Summary  The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets. Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily manual.  We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on community standards.  Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their work. Project Narrative Data that offer precise descriptions of data—metadata—are critical scientific resources that facilitate the discovery, reuse, and reproducibility of the data to which they refer. Our goal is to create methods and tools that improve the quality of scientific metadata hosted in public repositories, and thus enhance the discoverability and re-use of public biomedical datasets. Making data more accessible through scientifically rigorous metadata will accelerate the ability to make transformative data-driven biomedical discoveries using public data archives.",The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR,10093841,R01LM013498,"['Age', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Categories', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numerical value', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data archive', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'metadata standards', 'public repository', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'search engine', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334847
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Prognosis', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Career Development K12 Program PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall objective of the NEI Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program Award at UCSD is to develop outstanding clinician scientists to successfully compete for NIH grants and emerge as leaders within academic ophthalmology. Through this institutional career development award, we will continue to mentor clinician scientists toward independent academic appointments in ophthalmology. Since 1991, the UC San Diego Shiley Eye Institute has excelled in mentoring the career development of clinician scientists throughout ophthalmology. Many of these individuals now have successful research and clinical careers around the world; they include Department Chairs, Division Chiefs, and impactful academicians. With continued funding, we will amplify these strengths through a structured program of mentoring, research, and education to identify and mentor the next generation of academic clinician scientists, across all subspecialty areas of ophthalmology. With an emphasis on recruiting strong applications from women and minority applicants, Scholars will be selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in ophthalmology. The Scholar will undertake these activities in the area of basic and/or clinical sciences appropriate to their scientific focus, and by partnering with mentor(s) to facilitate career development. Each Scholar will be trained in clinically relevant research, statistics, scientific writing, grant preparation, ethics, leadership, and the responsible conduct of research. Additional aspects of the curriculum of each Scholar will be individualized by the Program Director (PI), Research Directors, Education Director, Executive Committee, Mentoring Group, and lead mentor based upon the Scholar's selected primary research track and his/her skills, background, and career goals. Each Scholar will create an original research program and through this Award develop an independent academic career. We propose six primary research tracks: (1) Visual Neuroscience, (2) Genomics and Proteomics, (3) Bioengineering, (4) Stem Cell Biology, (5) Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, and (6) Clinical (human subjects) Research. In the first K12 funding period, we trained and recruited four clinician scientists in the subspecialty areas of retina (2), glaucoma (1), and pediatric ophthalmology (1). Two of these Scholars already have received NIH K08 awards, and the other two have submitted K08 proposals that are under consideration. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through renewal of this K12 Career Development Program, we will continue to combine excellence in research mentoring, didactic education, and formal career development guidance to bring outstanding clinician scientists to careers in academic ophthalmology and vision research.",Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Career Development K12 Program,10190539,K12EY024225,"['Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Department chair', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethics', 'Eye', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human Subject Research', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Ophthalmology', 'Preparation', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Retina', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'next generation', 'programs', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem cell biology', 'vision science', 'visual neuroscience']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K12,2021,493372
"Administrative Supplement: Improving AI/ML-Readiness of data generated from HALBE or other NIH-funded research PROJECT SUMMARY Currently, data collected and shared in the biorepository of our parent project HABLE continues to expand rapidly. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) cannot make these data valuable to biomedical research until these data are AI/ML-ready. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective AI/ML readiness for HABLE and other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. This proposal will focus on three critical and common areas to improve the AI/ML-readiness of data generated from our parent HABLE project: missing data imputation, feature selection and outlier removal, and data readiness report. We will address the following three specific aims: Aim 1) Develop a Machine Learning Based Multiple Imputation Method for Handling Missing Data; Aim 2) Develop a Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) Algorithm for Feature Selection and Outlier removal, and Aim 3) Develop an Integrated Tool to Report Data Readiness. The algorithms and tools from this application will be the first of their kind to report data readiness for NIH data- sharing projects to facilitate heterogeneous data and feature engineering for AI/ML. It will make data scientists improve their AI/ML modeling more effectively and effortlessly. The administrative supplement project will benefit not only the parent HABLE project but also all other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. We expect that with the development of the algorithms and tools we will complete high data readiness in the HABLE project, which will eventually make HABLE more innovative in developing state of the art methods for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) clinical trials, leading to the development of effective personalized treatments which slow the progression of, and prevent, AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Effective AI/ML readiness is critical for data mining, modeling, and prediction in HABLE and other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. This research project will develop algorithms and tools to improve the AI/ML-readiness of data generated from NIH-funded research from three areas: missing data imputation, feature selection and outlier removal, and data readiness report. The algorithms and tools proposed herein will make the AI/ML endeavors of data scientists more efficient, productive, and successful.",Administrative Supplement: Improving AI/ML-Readiness of data generated from HALBE or other NIH-funded research,10415363,R01AG058533,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Latino', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Serum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'data mining', 'drug discovery', 'feature selection', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'parent project', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'repository', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2021,142142
"COBRE: Center for Computational Biology of Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to strengthen and extend the research capacity of the COBRE Center for the Computational Biology of Human Disease (CBHD) at Brown University and affiliated hospitals. High throughput data from multiple ‘omics-level’ technologies are fundamental factors in the identification and treatment of human disease. The acquisition of these data is now straightforward, but the efficient and creative interpretation of these data remain a serious impediment to progress for junior faculty in both the basic and translational aspects of biomedical science. The underlying principle of this Center is that close collaboration between laboratory scientists working with model systems and data scientists working with computational and bioinformatics tools can accelerate the implementation of human disease research. In Phase 1, we established the CBHD COBRE around a Computational Biology Core (CBC) and support for junior faculty Project Leaders (9) and Pilots Project leaders (8). These Project Leaders have been awarded six NIH R01s, an R35 MIRA, an NIH T32 Training Grant, an NIH R21, a USDA grant, a Sloan Award, and a Searle Award, totaling ~$17.9M. In Phase 2 we will strengthen this research environment with support for four new Project Leaders and a plan for growth and sustainability of the CBC that serves as the analysis and training hub of this COBRE. Our innovative joint mentoring strategy where each Project Leader is advised by both computational and biological or clinical senior faculty members has proven successful, and this will be extended. Moreover, we will build sustainable support for the CBC through expanded collaboration with COBRE graduates and other faculty on external grant support plus internally funded staff data scientists. The long-term goal of the Center is to grow a nexus of computational biology infrastructure for the greater Brown and hospital environments that will benefit all of Rhode Island. The objective of this proposal is to strengthen the infrastructure of the CBHD COBRE to ensure the transition of junior faculty Project Leaders to R01-funded scientists, and raise the computational proficiency and diversity of the broader biomedical research community. The three Aims are: Aim 1. Support the research of junior faculty Project Leaders pursuing biological and computational approaches to human disease. Aim 2. Broaden the CBHD research environment through enhanced Pilot and Mentoring programs that increase faculty recruitment and promote funding independence for Project Leaders. Aim 3. Strengthen the Computational Biology Core through enhanced staffing and broader access across the Brown biomedical community to build sustainability. The four new Research Projects are: 1. Local Regulation of T-cell Differentiation and Function in the Reproductive Mucosa; 2: Profiling Gene Expression and Mechanophenotype in Circulating Tumor Cells Ex Vivo; 3: Mapping Long-range Allosteric Pathways in CRISPR-Cas9; 4: Modeling Long-range Regulatory Interactions to Predict Gene Expression Using Graph Convolutional Networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of COBRE Center for Computational Biology of Human Disease is to enhance the research infrastructure for computational and bioinformatics analyses of biological research related to human disease. In this Phase 2 proposal we seek to strengthen the collaborations between laboratory scientists working with model systems and data scientists working with computational and bioinformatics tools to accelerate and sustain the implementation of translational medicine at Brown University and its affiliated hospitals.

"OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function Project summary Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Astronomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'data standards', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'imaging platform', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus', 'web portal']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246
"DS-I Africa - LAW Project Summary/Abstract The proposed project will have a strong focus on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa. Accordingly, the proposed project is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. Without knowledge of the law, scientists risk starting a health research project only to later find the data that they have generated cannot be used as planned; without knowledge of the law, scientists risk wasting resources, legal liability, and even criminal sanctions. Accordingly, scientists need clarity regarding the `hard' law that governs the use of data in health research. The law can often be multi- layered, complex, and may differ between jurisdictions. Therefore, to facilitate health discovery and innovation that uses data science, legal clarity will be provided on a variety of critical legal themes, listed below. The expected output of the proposed project will be practical guides for scientists on how to be legally compliant with regard to each of these themes. The impact will be that scientists who plan projects using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa (or with African collaborators) will be empowered to take the required actions to be legally compliant. The proposed project will have a broad jurisdictional scope, involving the law of twelve African nations. Five critical legal themes will be investigated over a three-year period: (1) modes of informed consent to the use of data; (2) the nature and content of individual and community rights in genomic data; (3) the use of persons' geospatial data for public health surveillance; (4) the cross-border sharing of data; and (5) the use of data as basis for Artificial Intelligence (AI). An important cross-cutting theme and goal of the proposed project is the decolonization and Africanization of extant law related to the use of data in health research. The proposed project will critically engage with the extant law of the twelve jurisdictions from the perspective of current trends in African legal philosophy. The expected outcomes are recommendations for legal innovation and inter- jurisdiction harmonization. The impact of these recommendations will be to empower policymakers in Africa to make the relevant law more attuned to the needs and expectations of the people of Africa. The project team consist of leading law academics from different regions in Africa – boasting with a collective publication record of 148 articles in peer-reviewed journals. The team's core expertise is the legal regulation of data, and African legal philosophy. Accordingly, the team is perfectly positioned to successfully execute the proposed project. Project Narrative The proposed project focuses on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa, and is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. The proposed project will provide legal clarity and practical guidance on issues that are critical for scientists, and make recommendations for legal innovation and inter-jurisdiction harmonization through the lens of decolonization and Africanization. The proposed project will have a broad jurisdictional scope involving twelve African nations, and will be driven by a project team of leading law academics from different regions in Africa.",DS-I Africa - LAW,10308774,U01MH127690,"['Africa', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'COVID-19', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Dimensions', 'Ethics', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human Rights', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intellectual Property', 'International', 'Internet', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Legal Liability', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Property Rights', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Technology', 'base', 'benefit sharing', 'data sharing', 'empowered', 'ethical legal social implication', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lens', 'novel', 'social implication', 'trend', 'wasting']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL,U01,2021,398940
"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design. Structure prediction algorithms could provide atomic models for these purposes in the near future. This proposal will leverage the structure-based technology, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), to develop methods to experimentally validate these atomic models and increase their accuracy.",Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY),10171872,R01GM137021,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bypass', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'beamline', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'risk prediction', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2021,406940

"NDEx - the Network Data Exchange A Network Commons for Biologists Summary Knowledge of the hallmark networks of cancer has been key to interpreting the molecular heterogeneity seen within and across tumors. NDEx, the Network Data Exchange (www.ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists can upload, share, and publicly distribute molecular networks and pathway models. We are currently two years into a three-year grant from the National Cancer Institute (U24 CA184427A), during which time we have created the NDEx open-source platform; released NDEx as a public website; and begun to link NDEx to applications such as Cytoscape. Having built this initial system, our goals for the next funding period are to rapidly develop NDEx network content and communities and the means by which these resources impact cancer research and treatment. In particular, we will (1) Connect NDEx networks to next-generation cancer genome analysis; (2) Enable the direct publishing of interactive networks on journal websites; (3) Develop hallmark cancer pathway content via social organization and automation; and (4) Scale the NDEx framework to support a growing community of users and analysis tools. Through these aims, the emphasis of the NDEx Project transitions from core infrastructure to genome analysis workflows, cancer-relevant network content, publishing, and community building. These developments address a strong and immediate need in cancer research for a cyberinfrastructure that can analyze genome-scale information in the context of molecular networks. Narrative NDEx (www.ndexbio.org) is an online commons in which biological networks can be shared, published and used by cancer researchers. Informatics applications for analysis and visualization can use NDEx as a hub to exchange networks, facilitating modular workflows.
