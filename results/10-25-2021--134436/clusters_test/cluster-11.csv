"Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism Abstract This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics (e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill, and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together, these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy. These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc- cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD. Project Narrative At the most basic level, social communication boils down to what you say and what you do while interacting with other people. Problems with social communication affect individuals with ASD throughout their lives, but expensive and time-consuming measurement tools have hindered the development of effective treatments for this core challenge. In this proposal, we aim to improve clinical characterization and diagnostic decision- making in ASD and other psychiatric conditions by digitizing human vocal interaction and using advanced machine learning techniques to fuse audio-video signals into an autism-specific algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for future precision medicine efforts and advancing the state of public health.",Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism,10165685,R01DC018289,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'clinical care', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cognitive process', 'data fusion', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'learning classifier', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'sound', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,595521
"Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype Abstract  Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and differences have also been observed more subtly in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP; a cluster of subclinical features related to ASD, which are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Prosody is a central component of pragmatics, which includes aspects of speech and language that modulate and enhance meaning at grammatical, pragmatic, and affective levels including stress and intonation, which are conveyed by changes in fundamental frequency, intensity, and rate. Atypical prosody in ASD has been identified as the most prominent feature that immediately identifies an individual with ASD as “odd” compared to typically developing peers, causing significant obstacles to social interaction and integration1-3. More subtle differences in prosody have also been observed among parents of individuals with ASD, and may serve as a key marker of ASD genetic risk, measurable in affected and unaffected individuals. Because speech samples may be easily obtained, identification of key prosodic profiles in ASD and profiles reflecting genetic liability to ASD, could have widespread implication as a biomarker for detection of ASD risk, and as a tool for assessment and interventions focused on this clinically significant feature of ASD. Limitations in current work pose significant barriers to the objective and efficient characterization of prosody, where current methods typically rely on subjective perceptual ratings which, though clinically valid, are difficult to obtain and apply objectively in treatment contexts, and are unfeasible for application with large samples. Moreover, without extensive training, perceptual rating methods are not adequately sensitive for capturing important variation and heterogeneity in ASD prosodic profiles, or identifying the often quite subtle yet biologically meaningful prosodic differences that may be observed in clinically unaffected relatives. These factors together impose substantial barriers to reproducibility, limit scalability, and render prosodic characterization unfeasible for use by clinicians. This project attempts to address these challenges by applying sophisticated computational modeling of extensive existing speech and language samples collected through a larger companion project (R01DC010191, PI: Losh), to characterize prosodic profiles in ASD and in parents. In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate evidence of distinct prosodic profiles of individuals with ASD and parents, along with relationships to broader pragmatic language abilities and neural processing of speech sounds in ASD and parents, supporting the goals of this project to apply sophisticated computational tools to speech data obtained across multiple contexts in order to 1) identify prosodic profiles that characterize ASD and the BAP in parents, and 2) examine how prosodic profiles relate to broader clinical-behavioral phenotypes, and aggregate within families, potentially contributing phenotypic signatures of clinically and etiologically more homogeneous subgroups. Project Narrative Difficulty with the social use of language, including impairments in the rhythmic and intonational features of language used to convey intention and emotions that are essential for establishing connections with social partners, is a hallmark of ASD. Subtle differences in these language features have been observed among clinically unaffected relatives as well, and might serve as subclinical markers of genetic risk to ASD. This project aims to provide clinically and biologically meaningful measures of such language differences, using state-of-the- art computational modeling of social language characteristics in ASD, to inform clinical assessment, treatment, and biological studies of ASD.",Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype,10113580,R03DC018644,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Companions', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'speech processing', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,74639
"Assessment of speech- and fine-motor coordination and their link to language in children with autism spectrum disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with motor difficulties in speech production and fine-motor tasks. Assessments of motor impairments, however, can be subjective and miss subtle and specific abnormalities. Therefore, there is a need to develop objective measures for clinicians to assess and understand speech- and fine-motor impairments in individuals with ASD. In addition, recent research suggests that difficulties with speech production, fine-motor, and oculo-motor tasks may contribute to language difficulties in ASD. The purpose of this project is to develop objective measures of speech- and fine-motor coordination in children with ASD, and to characterize the relationship between motor modalities and expressive language in ASD using these measures. We will focus on three speech subsystems: articulatory, laryngeal, and respiratory, as well as handwriting and eye movement. In a pilot study we conducted at the Lurie Center for Autism, we utilized novel coordination features developed in our lab to highlight lower complexity of coordination, or higher coupling, between and within speech subsystems in highly verbal children with ASD as compared to neurotypical controls. The analyses also indicated lower complexity of coordination during handwriting in children with ASD, suggesting there may be similar underlying mechanisms across these motor systems. In the proposed project, we will extend upon these promising results, evaluating measures of motor coordination using low-level features derived from speech, handwriting, and eye movement tasks completed by children with ASD and neurotypical controls. We will employ acoustic-to-articulatory inversion techniques to extract more physiologically accurate vocal tract articulator movements and coordination. Aim 1 uses measures of coordination to characterize the complexity of speech- and fine-motor coordination in children with ASD. We will also determine the features which provide the highest discriminatory ability between children with ASD and neurotypical controls using machine learning models. We expect that identification of patterns of complexity and important discriminatory features will provide a better understanding of the dependencies across and within motor subsystems, which could be used for objective assessment and tracking of motor difficulties in ASD. Aim 2 characterizes the relationship between speech- and fine-motor skills and expressive language ability. We will evaluate correlations and regressions between measures of motor coordination and scores on assessments of expressive language. We believe that motor tasks and features which show high correlations with evaluations of language ability will provide further insight into how motor modalities are associated with language difficulties in ASD. In summary, this proposal aims to quantify and understand speech- and fine-motor coordination challenges in ASD using objective measures of motor coordination, and aims to characterize the relationship between speech- and fine- motor subsystems and expressive language in ASD. This project works towards our long-term goal of developing a platform to assess, understand, and track motor and communication challenges in children with ASD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children in the United States. Children with ASD typically display challenges with speech- and fine-motor coordination, which have also been hypothesized to contribute to expressive language difficulties in this population. In this project, we aim to develop objective measures of motor coordination challenges across speech, handwriting, and eye movement tasks and aim to assess their relationship with clinical measures of expressive language in children with ASD.",Assessment of speech- and fine-motor coordination and their link to language in children with autism spectrum disorder,10381787,F31DC019509,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articulators', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Dependence', 'Discrimination', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwriting', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Larynx', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior measurement', 'clinical predictors', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'insight', 'language outcome', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'respiratory', 'sensorimotor system', 'social', 'visual tracking']",NIDCD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2021,33799
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,10181076,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized diagnostics', 'random forest', 'symptomatology', 'treatment stratification', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,1157073
"The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype Project Summary Extremely little is known about neural and cognitive changes or long-term prognosis for adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) older than 50 years of age, although in the US alone hundreds of thousands of people with ASD will reach this age group in the coming decades. Cross-sectional findings suggest that new cognitive, sensorimotor, and mental health problems emerge and that accelerated brain tissue loss occurs. Functional and structural brain connectivity is also affected, as shown with resting state functional MRI and diffusion MRI.  This project aims to characterize mid- to late-life trajectories of brain anatomy and function in ASD, as well as cognitive and behavioral change, and identify risk factors that predict poor outcomes including suspected effects of declining GABA concentrations and excitatory:inhibitory imbalance in aging. The proposed renewal will leverage an existing cohort (Cohort 1) of 40-70 year olds with ASD and matched typical comparison (TC) participants. In addition, a new cohort (Cohort 2) of 50 individuals with ASD and 70 TC participants age 40-70 will be recruited. Both cohorts will be followed longitudinally, with data collection every 3.5-5 years. Extensive data will be acquired at each time-point, including multimodal MRI scans, measures of GABA concentration from MR spectroscopy, diagnostic, cognitive, and behavioral assessments, as well as medical and personal history information.  The project will pursue 3 specific aims. Aims 1 will identify alterations (and altered rates of change) in brain anatomy, function, and connectivity and relate these to behavioral changes in 3 suspected risk domains of Motor, Executive, and Affective function. Aim 2 will test for group differences and effects of age in GABA concentrations and in network integration and segregation. Aim 3 will identify behavioral and neural risk factors of adverse (or positive) outcomes (e.g. on scales of maladaptive behavior, loss of daily living skills) using machine learning, and identify ASD subgroups based on GABA levels, differential rates of change, or differential domain-specificity. Project Narrative This project will generate extensive evidence on links between brain changes and behavior in adults with autism spectrum disorders between 40 and 70 years of age, for whom relevant data are extremely limited. Some specific focus will be on neuronal excitation:inhibition balance, which changes in aging. This systematic body of evidence will provide crucial information in the quest for predictors of long-term neurocognitive success or decline in ASD, thus serving as a first step to developing interventions to protect against such decline.","The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype",10299529,R01MH103494,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'insight', 'middle age', 'multimodality', 'prospective', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'young adult']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,743961
"Validation of the online Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screener (TADAS) at 18 months Project Summary Abstract The American Academy of Pediatrics has mandated identification of autism (ASD) beginning at the routine 18-month visit, based on evidence that early intervention for children with autism improves outcomes. However, the US Preventive Task Force has not endorsed that recommendation, in part because of limited validity data. This study builds on a series of studies by our group aimed at improving early autism identification. We have developed a promising novel and efficient screener for primary care called Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screen (TADAS). The TADAS was developed using machine learning to automatically determine which items to collect from the parent in each case based on data from a community sample in a previous project. Currently used autism screeners have high rates of missing children who have signs of ASD or Developmental Delay (DD) and also problematic and costly rates of over-referral. Data from our prior studies showed that TADAS had nearly three times the sensitivity (.94 vs .32) and similar specificity (.87 vs .90) to the currently recommended and most popular screen for autism (M-CHAT-R/F) and more than twice the sensitivity (.94 vs .39) and similar specificity (.79 vs .85) for developmental delay of the current standard Age & Stages Questionnaire-3tm. The TADAS also provides greater efficiencies since a difficult-to-implement recommended follow-up interview is not required and there is less parent burden in overall number of items. This proposal is to program TADAS for online delivery then validate it against diagnostic testing for ASD and DD in a new community sample of children coming for their 18-month well child visit that better reflects the U.S. population in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic status than our original study population. If our initial results are further validated in this study, screening for early ASD and DD could be much more effective with corresponding improvements in child outcomes through earlier intervention. A side benefit of the project will be an efficient Computer Adaptive Testing language screen based on existing national language abilities data that could be used independently to both track language impaired toddlers who are at risk for later development of autism as well as for general language screening in primary care. These innovative new tools are being created within an online clinical support system, called CHADIS that has additional features to assist in the entire process of early identification, referral, and tracking. CHADIS provides individualized patient education for the parent; clinician use of care coordination software connecting primary care with early intervention services with options to share data and track outcomes; as well as options for doctors to receive required Board re-certification credits for participating in autism screening quality improvement efforts. The final product and “system of care” of value to clinicians, insurers, municipalities and states. Project Narrative The American Academy of Pediatrics has mandated identification of autism beginning at the routine 18-month visit, based on evidence that early intervention for children with autism improves outcomes, but there are concerns about the accuracy of currently available screening tools at that age. This project builds on data from a previous grant showing that using machine learning algorithms individualizing presentation of items to screen for autism and developmental delay (called TADAS) dramatically improved accuracy of screening with lesser parent burden and benefits to office workflow. The proposed study is required to bring this promising tool to clinical use by programming it into our online clinical process support system (CHADIS) and then completing validation in a new community sample of toddlers weighted to be representative of the U.S. population.",Validation of the online Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screener (TADAS) at 18 months,10153564,R44HD104973,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Certification', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Language Tests', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid services', 'Municipalities', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Qi', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'S Phase', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Side', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialty Boards', 'Specificity', 'Support System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'Well Child Visits', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care systems', 'case-based', 'cost', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'developmental disease', 'early screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'online delivery', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'study population', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,250263
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,10072077,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'insight', 'movie', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2021,426957
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,10205977,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,195916
"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,10464139,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Cre driver', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2021,41702
"Neural signatures of outcome in preschoolers with autism Objective. This proposal has the important goal of furthering our understanding of the longitudinal course of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is motivated by the urgent need for early prognostic markers able to explain the extensive heterogeneity of ASD outcomes. To this end, we propose a longitudinal study of young children with ASD (2-3 years) to identify the neurobiological underpinnings of early developmental changes in restricted repetitive behavior/interests (RRB) – one of the most clinically impairing aspects of ASD - and their predictive contribution to later function. The proposal builds on the confluence of related findings and our own work including: 1) clinical evidence that RRB changes over the age window between ~29 and 42 months are prognostic markers of ASD adult functioning; and 2) advances in brain developmental functional connectomics that allow investigations of neural circuits in preschoolers with ASD using natural sleep MRI. We specifically aim to test 1) whether changes from 24-36 to 36-48 months-of-age (T1, T2) in the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of somatomotor (SM) striatal-cortical circuitry are associated with changes in the repetitive sensory motor (RSM) subdomain of RRB; and 2) whether these early brain-behavioral changes predict later (age: 48-60 months, T3) adaptive functioning. Exploratory aims will examine the potential contributions of structural connectivity changes in striatal-cortical tracts, and test whole-brain iFC employing unbiased connectome-wide association. Finally, we will explore the value of an alternative, data-driven hierarchical clustering approach to characterizing outcomes based upon multiple clinical dimensions at T3. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete T1 and T2 brain-behavioral data from 100 preschoolers with ASD enrolled at age 24-36 months and followed prospectively on a yearly basis. At T1 and T2, preschoolers will undergo natural sleep imaging with state-of-the-art MRI (high resolution T1- and T2-weighted structural MRI, multiband resting state fMRI (R- fMRI), and when possible, diffusion tensor) and phenotypic assessments rigorously selected to deeply phenotype a range of ASD core and associated symptoms. To examine the predictive value of iFC and RSM changes (i.e., T1-T2) to later function, children will be re-evaluated at 48-60 months (T3). A partial list of assessments includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2, Behavioral Observation Social Communication Checklist, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, clinician and parent measures of comorbid psychopathology and adaptive functioning. Brain-behavior analyses will primarily rely on R-fMRI, and explore diffusion tensor imaging. Significance. Findings will elucidate the neural correlates of changes in RSM at the earliest practical time following clinical diagnosis. They will provide a developmentally informed understanding of the neural underpinnings of outcomes, thus bringing the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals. Such knowledge is essential for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Impact is maximized by sharing de-identified data with the NDAR and ABIDE yearly to accelerate scientific progress.  NARRATIVE This proposal aims to provide means to address an important question that follows the diagnosis of autism; “what is the prognosis?” To begin to answer this question, we propose to use advanced brain imaging and clinical methods to identify the circuits responsible for early changes in restricted repetitive behaviors and their role in predicting later clinical outcomes. If we are correct, our results would support the development and improvement of new treatments.  ",Neural signatures of outcome in preschoolers with autism,10203750,R01MH115363,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'associated symptom', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'brain behavior', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'data de-identification', 'design', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'motor symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'outcome prediction', 'prospective', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'young adult']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,697991
"Spatiotemporal and functional convergence of genes implicated in ASD SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders.

"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,10092221,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychoses', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,690443
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,10208649,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'feasibility testing', 'hemodynamics', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,796501
"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,10057391,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,720921
"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",10125199,R44MH118763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurobehavioral test', 'patient variability', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2021,1088257
"Discovering Eye Tracking Biomarkers of ASD with Diagnostic and Prognostic Power Children with ASD, on average, are not identified and treated until around age 4‐years, several years beyond the first signs and symptoms. Even when toddlers are diagnosed as ASD, parents and clinicians have little information to guide treatment decisions or predict the early course of that child's next few years. Research is needed to discover objective biomarkers that detect ASD at early ages with high accuracy, indicate disorder subtypes linked to definable clinical profiles, and convey prognostic information. The discovery of such biomarkers have been elusive, in part, because most studies utilize small sample sizes and fail to include non‐ASD delay contrast groups which are essential to enhance specificity. Our proposal plans to fill this gap by leveraging eye tracking technology to determine if visual fixation patterns in a large sample of very young (12‐36 months) ASD and non‐ASD toddlers (n=225) from the general population can be used to discover an eye tracking biomarker profile of ASD. The prognostic power of our eye tracking biomarkers will be determined by linking initial eye tracking scores to clinical profiles 1‐2 years later. Given the heterogeneity in ASD, it is unlikely that a single eye tracking test would detect all toddlers. Here we plan to remedy this by testing the utility of a battery of 9 developmentally appropriate, short (~1‐minute each), eye tracking tests that each tap into a foundational domain in ASD symptoms including: visual social attention, gaze shifting, and auditory social attention. Our tests will objectively quantify key metrics such as overall fixation levels within social versus non‐social images, the frequency of gaze alterations during joint attention and gaze following tests and, using unique gaze contingent technology, the degree to which a toddler prefers to listen to prosodic, emotionally valent, motherese speech. Our preliminary findings suggest that several of our proposed eye tracking tests have extremely high diagnostic accuracy. Findings, however, are sometimes not replicated in science, and we proactively address this by proposing concurrent, independent and exact (equipment, software, paradigms, procedures) replication testing of each of our eye tracking tests within an independent cohort of toddlers at U. Washington (n=90 toddlers). Thus, in AIM 1 we will discover an eye tracking biomarker that detects ASD at early ages (12‐36 months) with high accuracy using artificial neural networks at UCSD, and then we will independently test replication of its performance at U Washington. To enhance interpretability, our approach will incorporate patterns of metrics from each eye tracking test to produce an Autism Risk Score (ARS) scaled from 0‐100 that represents the level of ASD risk for a toddler. In AIM 2, using a rich clinical battery that captures each toddler's social, language, cognitive and symptom severity profile derived from a combination of standardized, parent report, and free‐play testing, we will identify clinically meaningful eye‐tracking based subtypes of ASD using unbiased network clustering approaches. In AIM 3 we will examine the prognostic utility of our eye tracking test battery by identifying the degree to which eye tracking‐based profiles at ages 12‐36 months can predict social, language, cognitive and attention abilities 1‐2 years later. Research is needed to discover objective biomarkers that detect ASD at early ages with high accuracy, indicate disorder subtypes linked to definable clinical profiles, and convey prognostic information. Our grant will identify diagnostic, subtype and prognostic biomarkers in a large sample of 1‐3 year old ASD toddlers using 9 innovative, developmentally appropriate 1‐minute eye tracking tests that each tap into a range of key domains in ASD including visual social attention, gaze shifting, and auditory social attention, and demonstrate independent replication of the diagnostic biomarker. Success will open new avenues for future studies to implement objective biomarker use in clinical settings, and identification of disorder subtypes with specific clinical profiles will provide a roadmap towards individually tailored treatments that best match the strengths and weaknesses of the individual child with ASD.",Discovering Eye Tracking Biomarkers of ASD with Diagnostic and Prognostic Power,10063560,R01MH118879,"['3 year old', '4 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Equipment', 'Eye Development', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Link', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'artificial neural network', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'feature selection', 'gaze', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'population based', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'standard of care', 'success', 'trait', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,722691
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,10231106,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prognosis', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'efficacious treatment', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2021,86880
"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,10148819,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387238
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families. These methods have potential to improve access to care and reduce the time lag between symptom emergence and diagnosis.",Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life,10201443,R01MH121344,"['4 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hour', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lifestyle-related condition', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer program', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'family burden', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,717517
"1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check‐ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well‐baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6‐10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check‐ ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12‐24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early‐detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state‐level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program. Success of this large and clinically valid first-of-its-kind work will spark more such studies of this vital question, and through that, future pediatric best-practices guidelines for age of detection and treatment of ASD can be properly based on objective evidence and implemented nation-wide.",1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD,10120731,R01MH121595,"['Academy', 'Achievement', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Characteristics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Language', 'Laws', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Massachusetts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Work', 'age effect', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'screening', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,1290640

"Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development, revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as 1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at 36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants, and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by atypical social communication and behavioral repertoire. The current studies aim to reveal how sensorimotor impairments may underlie, contribute, and regulate the neurobiology of this condition in toddlers recruited from the general population during the 2nd year of life and who were assessed for ASD vs. non-ASD outcomes during the 3rd year of life. Features of the neurobiologically grounded subtypes of ASD developed as part of this proposal will be used in future studies to predict diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in children with low-functioning form of ASD, those at risk for developing ASD, and those children with related disorders of neurodevelopment.",Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers,10127705,R01MH121605,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sensorimotor system', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2021,360836
"A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Project Summary Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also occur across a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders. RRB present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, interfere with family functioning and present a source of considerable stress for parents. Despite their clinical significance, underlying mechanisms behind this complex behavioral domain are poorly understood and effective, targeted, individually tailored treatment options are currently lacking. One of the major barriers to moving the RRB research agenda forward has been the lack of clarity around the structure and conceptualization of RRB and the limitations of the currently available measures, particularly in terms of their (i) inability to comprehensively capture the full range of RRB and (ii) lack of sensitivity to treatment-related change. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a parent report measure for comprehensive and quantitative RRB assessment applicable across clinical populations and across the life- span and useful in both etiological- and treatment-related research. In order to achieve this goal, we will first conduct advanced statistical analyses of multiple, large, high-quality datasets containing a range of currently available measures in order to achieve fine-grained differentiation between distinct RRB domains (Specific Aim 1) and to identify domains not adequately captured by the current measures (Specific Aim 2). The implementation of this initial phase of the project will ensure that robustness and generalizability of the factor structures for each individual measure across age, developmental level, gender, and diagnostic status, is established and that generalizable core RRB structure across the currently available RRB instruments is identified. Neither of these two different aspects have been comprehensively addressed before. Robust derived RRB factor structure, together with the identification of potential RRB domains that might be under- represented and not adequately depicted by the current instruments, together with the systematic review of the literature will inform the development of items of the new scale to capture the full range of RRB. The pilot version of the new scale will be psychometrically evaluated online within a large sample of children and adolescents with ASD (Specific Aim 3). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations aimed at further refinement of the newly developed informant-based scale and the development of a clinician interview and objective instrument, as well as their validation across ASD ansd neurodevelopmental disorders, and the testing of their utility as a clinical outcome measure. Project Narrative Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB), a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, and a source of stress and management challenges for families. In addition to utilizing existing large datasets to clarify the structure of RRB and develop comprehensive RRB taxonomy, this project will utilize the information gained from the innovative secondary data analysis to develop and pilot a newly developed comprehensive and sensitive RRB scale. This project will pave the way for new studies that will aim to further validate the new measure, explore its sensitivity to change and utility as an outcome in clinical trials and inform the development of new clinical observation and objective measurement tools.",A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors,10066368,R21MH121876,"['Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinically significant', 'compulsion', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'informant', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'motor behavior', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'stress management', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,197125
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",10019734,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital health', 'digital treatment', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2021,485065
"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD,10290878,F32MH122057,"['11 year old', '13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hyperactivity', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'anxious', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'course development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early adolescence', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'symptomatology', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F32,2021,68694
"Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD. Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model- based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g. face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant, interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1) hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD- relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular, we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically- driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets. Project Narrative Despite social deficits being core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contributing to relationship difficulties and low employment rates, their neurobiological underpinnings are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about the brain mechanisms underlying social deficits in autism using computational modeling, novel brain imaging tools, and interactive experimental tasks that simulate dynamic social interactions. In contributing to our understanding of the brain basis of ASD, this study may unveil new directions for intervention.",Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder,10261593,R01MH122611,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Values', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'face perception', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'geometric structure', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social norm', 'social relationships', 'social skills', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,745867
"Harnessing Electronic Health Records to Identify Participants and to Study Health Outcomes in Transition-Age Youth and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder The health care needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex and multifaceted, with access to quality care a major challenge. Co-occurring physical and mental health conditions are highly prevalent in transition-age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD. Treating these conditions represents an important avenue for improving quality of life in this population. Provider-based training programs, such as Project Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes (Project ECHO), has been shown to increase provider knowledge self-efficacy, although their impact on health care outcomes and health care utilization in TAY/adults with ASD is understudied. The overarching goal of this K18 application is to provide training in health services research related to TAY/adults with ASD, specifically focused on harnessing data from electronic health records (EHR) to study health outcomes in future interventional studies. These skills are preparatory to designing and carrying out a rigorous future trial of Project ECHO is TAY/adults with ASD. In the K18, I will use deidentified datasets at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Kaiser-Permanente Northern California (KPNC). My research specific aims are (1) Determine the utility of applying novel algorithms for identifying and characterizing cases of TAY/adults with ASD within the VUMC deidentified EHR and (2) Analyze how common physical and mental health conditions and measures of health care utilization change with increasing age in in an existing longitudinal cohort of TAY/adults with ASD within the KPNC EHR. My training goals are (1) Learn how to use pragmatic tools, such as natural language processing and phecodes, to identify TAY/adults with ASD and co-occurring conditions and (2) Learn how to analyze longitudinal health data. I will obtain this training through mentorship provided by Dr. Lisa Croen of KPNC and Drs. Jeffrey Neul and Lea Davis of VUMC as I conduct my research project. Formal coursework in Bioinformatics and Epidemiology, along with Responsible Conduct of Research, will enhance my practical experience. The environment provided by VUMC and KPNC is ideal for this training, given the expertise of both institutions in cutting-edge EHR-related research. The project is innovative given the proposed use of novel tools for identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and the proposed analysis of longitudinal EHR data related to health conditions and health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by a rising tide of adolescents with ASD who are entering adulthood and have complex healthcare needs Testing the effectiveness of provider training models to care for transition age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD requires skills in (1) identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and (2) analysis of longitudinal data on health conditions and health care utilization. In this K18, Dr. Malow will learn these critical skills through the use of two existing datasets, thereby equipping her to design rigorous studies of provider-based interventions aimed at improving health care in TAY and adults with ASD.",Harnessing Electronic Health Records to Identify Participants and to Study Health Outcomes in Transition-Age Youth and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder,10171620,K18MH122755,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Institution', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Perception', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Videoconferencing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness testing', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'patient population', 'physical conditioning', 'provider networks', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K18,2021,169139
"Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum (CICADAS) PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness CICADAS (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum)—a clinician-assisted, closed-loop technology, mobile application for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Via ten mobile assessments CICADAS will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. These data will populate a machine learning algorithm that will tailor the delivery of ten neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises targeting sensory processing abnormalities. This individualized assessment and treatment approach is posited to induce adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, thus maximizing the impact and generalizability of psychological Evidence Based Treatments targeting social skills and relational strategies, including PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills). In particular, we posit that CICADAS-induced enhancement of processing and cognition will facilitate the application of PEERS skills in the environment of adolescents with ASD, thus improving their real- world functioning. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS; 3) an enhancer for PEERS. In Specific Aim 1, we will finalize development, ensuring that assessment data correctly populate the closed- loop algorithm and correctly guide the delivery of individualized NB-SCT. Next, we will involve three adolescents with ASD and two PEERS clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine CICADAS. Once decisions regarding app design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run to verify that CICADAS is detecting and improving sensory processing abnormalities and cognitive deficits. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that CICADAS is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm randomized crossover trial with 48 adolescents with ASD to document the acceptability of CICADAS and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support an efficacy trial in Phase II designed to establish medical claims. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition.

"Health Information Technology to Support Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Risk Assessment for Early Diagnosis Project Summary / Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children in the US (1). The economic cost of ASD is estimated to be $66 billion per year in the US, from medical care and lost parental productivity (2). Early diagnosis is crucial since it allows for early treatment and the best long-term outcome. However, identifying children at high risk for ASD at an early age is challenging due to lack of specialists. To address this problem, the project's objective is to create health information technology (HIT) using information in electronic health records (EHR) to support non-expert clinicians in identifying children at high risk for ASD. The HIT will integrate two components that provide complementary information. The first component will leverage machine learning algorithms to label EHR of children at high risk for autism. Both traditional and deep learning, potentially leveraging each other, will be evaluated while systematically tracking quality and quantity of information in EHR and their effect on performance. The second component will focus on the EHR free text and identify phenotypic behavioral expressions of diagnostic criteria as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Rule-based natural language processing will be combined with machine learning algorithms. For both components, potential algorithm bias will be investigated and corrected or documented when this is not possible. The HIT will combine results from both components through an intuitive user interface. Since it is intended to be used as a human-in-the loop decision tool, it will also provide descriptive data on performance for both components. The final HIT will be developed using rapid prototyping in interaction with domain experts. It will be evaluated in a user study with representative non-expert clinicians. The evaluation will compare accuracy, confidence, and efficiency of identifying children at risk for ASD with and without the HIT by non-ASD experts. It will also systematically focus on the type, amount, quality and transparency of information provided, and how this interacts with user beliefs about their own expertise as well as their bias toward machine decisions. Different types of EHR as well as different levels of clinical expertise will be compared for effects of HIT use. Preliminary work has been conducted for all components with good results. However, this prior work focused on version IV of the DSM and used only free text from data rich EHR. The proposed project will expand the prior work to use DSM-5 criteria, train and develop the algorithms to use structured and unstructured fields in clinical, representative EHR, and work with EHR from different hospitals to evaluate potential obstacles and advantages of variability in data. Using information in EHR, this HIT will provide support especially for non-expert clinicians in their evaluation of children who may be at risk of ASD. The HIT will support early referrals leading to early diagnosis and therapy. It will be useful in a variety of different settings where domain expertise is missing. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobiological condition with increasing prevalence for which early diagnosis is crucial but unfortunately often late or missed entirely, in large part due to lack of trained clinicians. This project will create health information technology (HIT) that uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms with electronic health records to support non-expert clinicians in identifying children at risk for ASD. The HIT will be evaluated with non-expert clinicians for the minimum and optimal requirements to help clinicians make confident and high quality decisions.",Health Information Technology to Support Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Risk Assessment for Early Diagnosis,10297910,R01MH124935,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'economic cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'social', 'structured data', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,378122
"Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects ~1% of the population. Progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of ASD through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies that have identified several loci associated with ASD. However, a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. There are multiple reasons to expect that DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation. First, part of the ASD-related genes identified via DNA sequence variation include genes involved in chromatin modification and DNAm. Second, ASD likely originates during prenatal development, a period of dynamically regulated changes in DNAm in the brain. As this remodeling may result in epimutations that can dysregulate brain function, disruption of the DNAm regulation in utero represents a plausible ASD risk mechanism. Third, ASD is associated with several neonatal and other environmental risk factors. Because DNAm can be modified by environmental factors, it may mediate the effect of these risk factors on ASD.  The overall aims of this project is to enhance our understanding of DNAm in ASD etiology, and use DNAm marks at for early detection of individuals at risk for ASD. For this purpose we will generate methylome-wide data using samples from ASD cases age 18-25 years and matched controls from an existing Swedish case- control study called Population-based Autism Genetics and Environment Study. In addition, we will use stored neonatal blood samples to generate a second methylation profile for these same individuals at birth. Thus, we will have methylome-wide data from blood for two time-points from all participants, accompanied by longitudinal phenotype information spanning birth to current date obtained from the Swedish registers.  We will use a sequencing-based approach to assay the DNAm status of nearly all 28 million common CpG sites in the human genome and will perform a battery of novel statistical analyses including methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) of whole blood and individual cell-types in blood; analyses integrating DNAm information with neonatal risk factors and already existing GWAS and WES data; and studies exploring the role of DNAm in the ASD sex-bias. Significant findings will be replicated in four existing and independent blood sample collections, and studied in the newly generated methylation/expression data from ASD brain samples. Finally, we propose to use neonatal DNAm markers to create multi-marker methylation risk scores (MRSs) for predicting ASD risk. Although, there has been ample progress in identifying genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation and, therefore, we proposed to perform methylome- wide investigations using sequencing-based DNAm data and novel statistical approaches. The successful completion of this project means that we have identified ASD associated methylation marks that will enhance our understanding of the ASD etiology and may be used for risk prediction and early diagnosis of ASD.",Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder,10098730,R01MH124981,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Complement', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sex Bias', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Whole Blood', 'X Chromosome', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'factor A', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic epidemiology', 'improved', 'in utero', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'prenatal', 'risk prediction', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,764339
"Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder Project summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually diagnosed early in childhood. Understanding the developmental curves of brain functions in typically developing children and children with ASD will help to understand the brain correlates of ASD. In this project, we will analyze functional MRI (fMRI) data of more than 1,000 children and adults to portrait brain developmental curves. FMRI has been commonly used to study brain functions in action. Usually, participants are asked to do some strictly designed tasks on a computer, or simply lay in the scanner without thinking a thing in particular. A more natural way to perform scanning has been proposed, where the participants are asked to watch short movie clips during the scanning. However, data analysis for movie watching data becomes complicated. We have developed a novel method to examine functional communications between brain regions during movie watching. In this project, we will compare our new method with existing methods. The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will study brain developments in hundreds of typically developing children. We will compare data from movie watching and resting-state, and compare different analysis methods. The results will help us find better methods to chart the developing brain. In the second part, we will compare the developing curves between individuals with ASD and those in typically developing individuals. The data may help us to establish a better way to scan individuals of ASD, and a better way to characterize brain functions in ASD. Public health relevance Brain imaging examinations of individuals with autism spectrum disorder is challenging for both practical and theoretical reasons. This study proposes a method to study the communications between brain regions during a naturalistic movie watching condition. The method can help to understand brain communications in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and to portrait growth charts of brain functions.",Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder,10291842,R15MH125332,"['21 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clip', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portraits', 'Predictive Value', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thinking', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'design', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental state', 'movie', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'theories', 'trend']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2021,305061
