"Frequency domain diffuse optical spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy for assessing inspiratory muscle metabolism in mechanically ventilated patients PROJECT SUMMARY Mechanical ventilation (MV), which is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing in critically ill patients, led to $27 billion in expenditures in the US in 2010, accounting for 12% of all hospital costs. In that same year there were 2.7 episodes of MV per 1000 population, highlighting the enormous importance of this procedure. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased these numbers, although precise rates are not yet available. MV is used, in part, to “unload”, or reduce the metabolic effort of respiratory muscles in order to redirect oxygen delivery to vital organs. As the patients’ conditions improve, key inspiratory muscles (e.g. diaphragm, scalenes, sternomastoid, etc.) need to take over spontaneous breathing independent of the ventilator. This “reloading” is precarious due to muscle disuse atrophy, induced by unloading. This is further complicated by other common conditions such as septic or cardiogenic shock, which can severely limit oxygen delivery independent of muscle status. What’s needed is a methodology that can continuously monitor blood flow and oxygen utilization of inspiratory muscles so that respiratory effort can be continuously optimized during MV. This project aims to develop a comprehensive blood flow index, oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform for inspiratory muscle physiology by integrating wideband frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (wbDOS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to tackle this unmet need. wbDOS is a new all-digital frequency-domain DOS technique that captures amplitude and phase measurements over a wide bandwidth of modulation frequencies (50-500 MHz) at high speeds (>100 Hz). wbDOS and DCS will combine synergistically to provide pathlength- corrected estimates of absolute Hb/Mb concentrations and blood flow index (BFi), allowing for the extraction of tissue regional oxygen metabolic rate (MRO2i), a parameter directly linked to oxygen utilization. We hypothesize that wbDOS and DCS measurements can be acquired simultaneously at high speed (>10 Hz) with parallel detection and integrated electronics. This speed is needed to capture inspiratory/expiratory dynamics at the respiratory rate. Additionally, we hypothesize wideband frequency-domain DOS measurements will provide improved quantification of optical properties, BFi and MRO2i when optically integrated with DCS as compared to single frequency FD-DOS or CW-NIRS. We will validate this through rigorous system testing using flow-channel tissue-mimicking optical phantoms. A multi-layer inverse model will be developed to better capture inspiratory muscle metabolism by accounting for subcutaneous lipid thickness and skin tones. We will also expand on our recent work in Deep Neural Network (DNN) processing to develop high-speed algorithms for calculating Hb/Mb concentrations, StO2 (%), BFi (mm2/s), and MRO2i at 10 Hz. We will conduct a feasibility study (n=10) of healthy volunteers during respiratory muscle loading and unloading to evaluate performance compared to expected trends. It is anticipated that completion of these aims will yield a novel and comprehensive blood flow index, oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform (wbDOS-DCS) and lead to subsequent R01-scale funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here focuses on developing and validating a new non-invasive way to measure the metabolism of inspiratory muscles for patients under mechanical ventilation. This proposal focuses on technology development and clinical feasibility, and in the future this same technology can be used to improve the efficacy of mechanical ventilation and improve weaning success. As mechanical ventilation is currently associated with severe morbidities and a high mortality rate, improvements based on the technology proposed here have the potential to improve outcomes and decrease mortality for patients under mechanical ventilation.",Frequency domain diffuse optical spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy for assessing inspiratory muscle metabolism in mechanically ventilated patients,10194837,R21EB031250,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood flow', 'Boa', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Disuse Atrophy', 'Electronics', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospital Costs', 'Inflammation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Research', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Scientist', 'Septic Shock', 'Skin', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Sternocleidomastoid Muscle', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Ventilator', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'metabolic rate', 'mortality', 'muscle metabolism', 'muscle physiology', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'septic', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2021,215000
"Consumption of Contaminated Passaic River Fish Causes Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and May Influence Metabolic Syndrome Outcomes The Newark Bay/Passaic River region is home to a Superfund site that is heavily polluted with PCBs, mercury, and record levels of dioxin. There is very strong evidence that the marine life inhabiting these polluted waterways are contaminated with these toxic agents. Bottom or filter feeders, along with predatory species, often accumulate significant amounts of contaminants in their body tissue. Consumption of these species by humans exposes them to high levels of contaminants, which can lead to adverse health effects. Despite these findings and posted public warnings that vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women, babies, or elderly) should not consume marine life captured in these waterways, exposure through consumption continues in poor communities. A pilot study done by our lab sequenced 16S rRNA from the feces of adult mice that were fed autoclaved diets supplemented with 2.5% or 7.5% “dirty” Passaic River fish. A principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that consumption of “contaminated” eel feed sourced from the Passaic River affected GI tract community diversity and structure in male mice at both days 1 and 9, compared to the “clean” feed group. Because the gut microbiome encompasses key metabolic and life functions, such as endocrine signaling, lipid production, metabolism, and immune regulation, dysbiosis, or an imbalance of, bacterial community structure can lead to significant changes in overall wellness. Phenotypes may include those of metabolic syndrome - This grant aims to study how GI tract dysbiosis from consumption of contaminated Passaic River fish contributes to the biological effects of metabolic syndrome, which will be characterized as hypertension and triglyceride, HDL-C, and fasting glucose levels. We propose to do this by observing shifts in community structure of the gut microbiome, and analyzing phenotypes of metabolic disease in mice that have consumed contaminated fish captured from this waterway. Importantly, we will focus on mixtures and synergistic effects of contaminants, as it is unusual for such contaminants to exist independently of others. This research will model both environmentally relevant concentrations and real-world exposure scenarios where contaminated fish are consumed by anglers and their families. Finally, we will explore the preventative effects of probiotic treatment on GI tract dysbiosis. These findings will translate into healthier communities by raising awareness, reducing disease susceptibility, and protecting the health of poorer communities where families regularly rely on caught fish as sustenance. This project will provide valuable training opportunities in environmentally relevant coexposure assessments, microbiome analyses, and community health awareness as data is translated into public health policy and disease mitigation strategies. Gut dysbiosis from contaminated Passaic River fish consumption may produce adverse health effects linked to metabolic syndrome. This may be exacerbated by exposure to mixtures of contaminants, as is often the case at Superfund sites. Efficacious treatment with probiotics will offer a practical intervention for susceptible communities.",Consumption of Contaminated Passaic River Fish Causes Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and May Influence Metabolic Syndrome Outcomes,10157495,F31ES032737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Consumption', 'Crabs', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dioxins', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Eels', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Fishes', 'Food', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Home', 'Hypertension', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low Income Population', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mercury', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnant Women', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Rivers', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'bacterial community', 'contaminated seafood', 'dietary control', 'dysbiosis', 'efficacious treatment', 'exposed human population', 'fasting glucose', 'feeding', 'gut dysbiosis', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'lipid metabolism', 'male', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'pollutant', 'poor communities', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'remediation', 'response', 'sex', 'superfund site', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,39636
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,10215480,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dietary control', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'microbiome signature', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,637564
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10228732,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'algorithm training', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,607600
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,10149339,R00GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R00,2021,249000
"Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Within the last decade, we have made great strides in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) risk and progression, however much of the variation remains unexplained. We have achieved significant reductions in the time to diagnosis and we have improved diagnostic sensitivity, however specificity is not ideal. Further, most of the FDA-approved MS-specific immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) focus on the inflammatory disease component in the relapsing phase and have little effect on improving outcomes once a patient enters the progressive phase. The challenge for drug trials is the lack biomarkers to detect and monitor MS progression. The objectives of the current application are: 1. To identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from other central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNSIDDs) and non-CNSIDD controls, and 2. To identify biomarkers of disease activity and biomarkers that distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. We propose a multi-stage analysis of pre-existing and well- defined biological samples from two resources.  Aim 1. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify a metabolic signature discriminating MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls (HCs) in two cohorts. In the 1st cohort, MS patients who are early in their diagnosis (≤ 2 years) and IMT naïve/free will be compared to HCs and other CNSIDD cases. Discriminating metabolites will be tested for replication in a 2nd cohort comparing similarly defined MS patients to HCs and other CNSIDDs, and other autoimmune disease patients. We will determine the direction of the replicating MS- metabolite associations using bidirectional genetic instrumental variable analyses. Aim 2. Identify biochemical features of MS disease activity. We will identify metabolic variation corresponding to disease activity by comparing IMT naïve/free patients within 2 years of diagnosis and with a recent relapse to those who have been in remission for ≥3 months and to HCs using supervised classification in a discovery cohort followed by replication analyses in a 2nd cohort. Aim 3. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate progressive from relapsing MS. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify metabolic patterns associated with MS progression by comparing IMT naïve/free patients with relapsing forms of MS to progressive MS from at a single academic specialty clinic. Aim 4. Identify metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. In this exploratory aim we will identify gene-metabolite (GxM) interactions involving the primary MS risk factor, HLA-DRB1*15:01. The encoded peptide is involved in antigen presentation and effectively binds to many endogenous metabolites, suggesting a mechanism through which autoreactive T cells may be activated. We will conduct GxM analyses in MS-HC matched pairs to identify metabolites associated with MS risk in the context of HLA-DRB1.  At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified and characterized a serum-derived metabolomic signature that discriminates MS from other CNSIDDs and non- CNSIDD controls. We also expect to have identified novel serum markers of MS disease activity and progression, as well as putative metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to modify risk. These results will have an important positive impact by identifying serum-derived biochemical traits that could be used to improve diagnostic specificity in MS. There is also the promise of discerning novel molecular processes underlying MS, which will provide new opportunities for the development and evaluation of novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 900,00 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed, with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatory therapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden, thus there is a critical need for accurate discrimination of MS from non-MS conditions, and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor disease activity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target for identifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls, and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapse activity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.",Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,10197636,R01NS121928,"['Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complement', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Financial cost', 'Free Will', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health', 'Inflammatory', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuromyelitis Optica', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'autoreactive T cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medical specialties', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein', 'side effect', 'supervised learning', 'targeted therapy trials', 'trait']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,518973
"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"Democratizing Multi-Omics to Expedite Discovery of Hidden Metabolic Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how metabolism changes in many diseases because we lack methods for high-throughput, unbiased discovery of indirect metabolite-protein connections. Continued ex- istence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for many diseases will remain largely intractable. Multi-omic analysis of proteomes and metabolomes from the same system offers a promising path to discover hidden metabolic pathways, but the requirement for human expert interpretation is a critical barrier that prevents complete value extraction from multi-omic experiments. The long-term goal of the Meyer Research Group at Medical College of Wisconsin is to reveal previously hidden metabolic pathways. The overall objective here, which is the first step in realizing this vision, is to democratize multi-omic data collection and data interpretation, thereby increasing the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. The central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence models can learn to draw new metabolic connections between metabolites and proteins. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and published literature, which shows how the strategy reveals known and new connections between metabolites and proteins. The rationale for the proposed research is that unbiased, data- driven discovery of new metabolic connections with AI algorithms (such as deep neural networks) will result in new and innovative therapeutic targets that can be manipulated positively or negatively to prevent or treat dis- ease. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two complementary focus areas: (1) multi-omic data integration, and (2) multi-omic data collection. The multi-omic data integration focus uses AI models, already established as feasible in the applicant’s lab, to predict metabolite-protein inter- actions. AI models will be optimized with existing public data, models will be validated with newly collected data, and then novel metabolic connections will be validated using classic genetic and biochemical techniques. The second focus area builds new, fast methods for multi-omic data collection to feed data into AI models, starting from a recent advancement published by the applicant (Meyer et al., ChemRxiv 2020, accepted at Nature Meth- ods). The applicant’s lab will further develop this method to quantify the full yeast proteome, and also extend the method to enable multi-omic analysis on a single platform. This approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data interpretation requiring expert humans by building and validating a new, automated AI method for metabolite pathway discovery. The multi-omic data collection focus is innovative be- cause it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data collection requiring multiple platforms and hours per sample by enabling unified multi-omic analysis in minutes. This contribution will be significant because ulti- mately, the knowledge, validated methods, and resource datasets generated by this project will open new hori- zons in drug development for diseases with altered metabolism, such as cancers and diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of new metabolic connections between proteins and metabolites is ultimately expected to increase our range of treatable disease, which will lead to new therapeutics and increase healthy lifespan. The democratization of methods enabled by the proposed research will greatly increase the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission to develop fundamental methods and new technologies, and understand the principles that underlie living organisms.",Democratizing Multi-Omics to Expedite Discovery of Hidden Metabolic Pathways,10272870,R35GM142502,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biochemical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep neural network', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIGMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R35,2021,390000
"The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth Project Summary Perhaps the defining feature of the eukaryotic cell is its organization into biochemically distinct compartments known as organelles. While the biochemical functions of individual organelles are often well known, how cells regulate the copy numbers, sizes, and subcellular positions of its diverse organelles in a coordinated fashion and how organelles interact to produce integrated physiological outputs remain one of the grand challenges in cell biology. The goal of my research program is to discover the quantitative principles governing how cells regulate systems-level organelle dynamics to coordinate metabolism, growth, and proliferation. To achieve this goal, my research strategy will proceed along two directions. In the first direction, I will quantitatively determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics with cellular growth demands. Specifically, I will quantify and build a mathematical model of the relationship between cellular organelle composition and cell growth. The model will be calibrated from data obtained by simultaneously visualizing all major metabolic organelles using our machine learning-based hyperspectral imaging platform, exerting chemical biological control over cell growth and proliferation rates, and genetically perturbing key organelle biogenesis, organization, and interaction factors. In the second direction, I will determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics and gene expression to control metabolism during growth and proliferation. I will categorize single cells according to their organelle content and systematically measure the temporal correlations in their expression of genes whose products execute organelle-specific functions. I will concomitantly measure the metabolomic profile of these cells sorted by organelle content. I will then combine these measurements to develop a mathematical model that quantitatively captures the connection between gene expression and metabolism as mediated by the cell's organelle makeup. I will subsequently test predictions of this model by systematically tuning organelle interaction strengths by modulating the expression of organelle biogenesis factors and organelle contact sites. Successful investigations along these two directions will yield mechanistic insight into how to untangle the complex interdependencies between organelle dynamics, metabolism, and cell growth and proliferation. A systems- level understanding of how organelle composition and interactions coordinate metabolism to control cellular growth and development will lay a rigorous foundation into future investigations into how the cell actively shapes its organelle composition to match biochemical supply with physiological demand through, how this plasticity is leveraged in health by multicellular organisms to provide the metabolic flexibility needed to develop its myriad cell types, but also in disease by allowing for multiple routes to metabolic pathologies in cancer, diabetes, and aging. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: In eukaryotes from single-celled fungi to mammals, metabolism takes place in the context of cells organized into spatial compartments known as organelles. In this proposal, we seek to illuminate the fundamental quantitative principles by which the cell coordinates the dynamic properties of its organelles, their regulation by gene expression, and the role coordinated organelle dynamics plays in cellular growth and metabolism. Knowledge of these principles can help uncover mechanisms underlying how cells develop normally into cell types and how in the context of disease, such as cancer and diabetes, they remodel their organelle composition to handle altered metabolic profiles and thus point toward potentially new targets for therapy.","The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth",10274898,R35GM142704,"['Aging', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cell type', 'design', 'flexibility', 'fungus', 'genetic manipulation', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,393750
"Towards In Vivo Imaging of Tissue Metabolomics PROJECT ABSTRACT: The ability to measure and quantify the composition and abundance of various metabolites in biological samples, also referred to as metabolomics, provides a unique window into the complex biological processes at different scales. So far, the field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These technologies, although powerful, only measure metabolite profiles in homogenized biological extracts, e.g., biofluids or dissected tissues, thus losing the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes. As spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of metabolism, especially in complex biological systems such as animals and humans, obtaining spatially resolved metabolomics has been a dream of many biomedical scientists and engineers. In recent years, MS imaging (MSI) has emerged as a tool of choice for imaging metabolomics, which allows for the generation of spatially localized metabolite profiles from tissue sections. One major limitation of MSI is that it requires post-mortem or invasive tissue sampling, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. This has limited its translation to human studies. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is another alternative for imaging metabolomics. It combines the powers of MRI and NMR spectroscopy to produce spatially resolved tissue metabolite profiles, noninvasively. However, MRSI is highly limited in its poor spatial resolutions. Furthermore, most MRSI studies only target a single nucleus (e.g., 1H), thus limited in the number of molecular species measured. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a research program that will pave a path towards in vivo imaging of tissue metabolomics. Specifically, we aim to develop an unprecedented high-resolution multinuclear MRSI technology that can simultaneously map a large number of metabolites in vivo, synergizing advancements in ultrahigh- field MRI instrumentation, fast data acquisition, and machine learning driven computational imaging techniques. We also propose a novel multimodal MRSI and MSI imaging framework for validating our multinuclear MRSI technology and integrating two complementary biochemical imaging modalities for tissue metabolic profiling. Novel computational approaches will be developed to analyze the high- dimensional metabolomic data. Success of the proposed research will establish a new paradigm for generating and analyzing imaging metabolomics data. This paradigm will transform metabolomics into a powerful noninvasive and tissue specific technology (from an invasive and nonspatial-specific one) for studying metabolism in living animals and humans. These advances will enable new means to unravel the metabolic basis of normal physiological functions and different diseases, inspiring developments of new biomarkers, novel treatments, disease prognosis and management strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies that either completely lose the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes being studied or require invasive procedures, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states.

"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,10053329,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'Body mass index', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,224806
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune mediated destruction', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,10242687,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,415385
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,10146317,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,633791
"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10221654,F99CA253744,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2021,35758
"Development of next generation 2HG and metabolic MR imaging for precision oncology of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients 7. Project Summary/Abstract Gliomas are rarely curable tumors with a low survival rate of 36% at five-years that is well below the average survival rate of 67.2% across all cancers, according to SEER and CBTRUS. Malignant brain tumors cause an average of 20 years of potential life lost (YPLL) for individuals diagnosed as adults, which exceeds most common cancers. Survival and YPLL have not improved for gliomas similarly to other cancers and progress is desperately needed. The lack of improvement in patient outcomes is not due to lack of new discoveries, but due to limited success in translating this knowledge into clinical benefit. Important discoveries have been made over the last decade regarding key molecular mechanisms involved in glioma initiation and growth, which have been incorporated in the latest WHO classification. IDH mutation is the primary event in glioma initiation and has become a paradigm shift in the treatment of glioma. Neuro-oncology experts (SNO, EANO) agree that brain imaging can accelerate clinical trials of targeted therapies and mandated the development of molecular imaging for highly specific and sensitive glioma imaging. The long-term goal of our research is the development of non-invasive molecular imaging methods that can be used clinically in cancer patients. IDH mutations are frequent in glioma and produce high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that can be imaged as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, guidance of surgery and radiation, response to chemotherapy and targeted treatments. The objective of this application is to develop fast high resolution whole brain quantitative 2HG and metabolic imaging for diagnosis, treatment guidance and monitoring of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that advancing next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging will enable precision oncology and accelerate clinical translation of novel targeted therapies to improve outcomes in mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients. Three specific aims will be performed for this: 1) develop fast high-resolution whole-brain clinically robust 2HG and metabolic imaging, 2) improve sensitivity, precision, accuracy and workflow of 2HG and metabolic imaging, and 3) clinical translation of next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging in glioma patients. There are strong rationales for the proposed research: 1) there is no alternative in vivo imaging method specific for IDH mutations, 2) 2HG imaging is completely non-invasive, can be repeated safe without any radiation, can provide results fast and cost effective, 3) provides comprehensive evaluation of the entire tumor and healthy brain without the sampling bias of biopsies, 4) it can be performed pre-surgically and in tumors that cannot be operated. The approach is innovative because it employs the first available whole brain 2HG imaging method, which will be accelerated by compressed sensing, novel shim hardware to improve data quality, and transformed in a high throughput automated tool by deep learning. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will provide clinicians with a user-friendly and precise tool for diagnostic, guiding and monitoring of glioma patients. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the capabilities of clinical MR scanners to image specific molecular signatures of primary brain tumors. The new features will provide rapid scanning, improved data quality, and automated data analytics for clinical use. This would enable precision oncology in patients with mutant IDH glioma tumors for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical translation of targeted therapies.
