"Howard University Research Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities Principal Investigator/Program Director: John Kwagyan, PhD Project Summary Advances in technologies and computational tools has made it possible to generate and store large, complex, and diverse datasets. The behavioral, biomedical and health research enterprise is increasingly becoming data- intensive and data-driven. As a result, recognizing, understanding, and using big data for behavioral, biomedical, and health related research has become necessary to arrive at best evidence and enhance translation. Applied data science starts with identifying relevant data sources, developing algorithms and/or utilization of existing software tools to access these data and employing advanced data analytical skills for knowledge discovery and dissemination of information. In biomedical and healthcare areas, big data methodology is used in several fields including but not limited to medical imaging studies, drug discovery, genomics, predictive diagnosis and cost effectiveness studies. Data science also allows researchers to assess patient/population heterogeneity, through the integration of large data from published literature and meta-analysis to reach conclusions that can be used to inform clinical practice and guide public health policy. Despite the importance of the emerging field of data science and the recent rapid rise of its use, many minority institutions do not offer specialized training in data science. Moreover, though the approach is highly developed, there are few who possess the necessary skill set in this highly quantitative and technical field and training opportunities are uncommon and there exist disparities in data science expertise. Skill sets in data science, from ethical practices in data collection, use of complex computational and analytic techniques including machine learning, to data visualization and reporting, are particularly critical for advancing the science of minority health and health disparities. To bridge this gap, and address disparities in acquiring data science skills and its applications, we created the Howard University, HU RCMI Virtual Applied Data Science Training Institute, VADSTI. VADSTI, drew faculty with complementary experts in the conduct and application of data science from across different institutions and in partnership with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy, delivered a well-attended and successful 8-week comprehensive data science training. The ability of behavioral, biomedical and clinical researchers to recognize, and use big data is still limited in minority serving institutions, for various reasons including lack of exposure to relevant databases and knowledge of programming techniques and access to relevant software, tools, and expertise in data analytics. The need for creation of an ecosystem of data science resources and useful tools at minority serving institutions is warranted. The goals of the current application are, (i) to attract, train and engage the next generation of investigators in using advanced analytics and data science methodology with application to large existing minority health and health disparities datasets, (ii) continue to enhance capacity building by promoting and simulating the creation of data science ecosystem at HU.

The ability of minority researchers in the behavioral, biomedical and clinical science to recognize, and use big dataset, however, is limited for various reasons including lack of exposure to relevant databases, knowledge and incorporation of cutting-edge data science tools and capabilities, and expertise in data analytics.

"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process. Using big data analysis, we are developing a computational method to utilize drug similarity information to predict novel diseases that drugs can treat.",An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning,10112306,F31LM013058,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Encyclopedias', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Orphan', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Viagra', 'Voting', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data types', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'side effect']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2021,46036

"Using Neuroimaging Markers to Understand Risk Factors and Consequences of Cannabis on Brain Structure and Function Project Summary This application for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) requests support to develop a program of brain-based and behavioral research on substance use disorders (SUD), especially cannabis use disorder (CUD). My laboratory is supported in part by a funded R01 (DA039135) that seeks to understand the effects of medical marijuana on the brain, cognition, and escalation to CUD. In the next phase of my career, I propose to learn enhanced analytical techniques (e.g. machine learning and predictive modeling) that can capitalize on newly-available, large, longitudinal datasets that can answer fundamental questions about the development of SUD that cannot be answered in small populations. In addition, I propose a secondary training goal of gaining expertise in developmental neuroscience, to broaden the populations I can study to include children and adolescents at-risk for SUD. Together, these skillsets will allow me to greatly expand the types of questions I can ask, by allowing me to answer questions about SUD using both large observational data-sets, and also targeted experimental manipulations (such as my R01). My goal at the end of this K02 to have the tools to not only use big data to better understand risk factors and consequences of addiction in large samples, but also to use this knowledge to inform future experimental studies and clinical trials that I can conduct in my lab.  The scientific focus of this application is a research project, using the publicly-available Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset of 11,877 children scanned longitudinally, to understand how trajectories of change in impulsivity associate with brain-based abnormalities and SUD risk. The aims for the ABCD analysis project are to (1) define the factorial structure of impulsivity in the ABCD dataset as it may portend SUD risk (using a confirmatory factor model which will be applied to the array of behavioral tasks, self- report measures, and parent reports), (2) determine structural and functional brain measures that correlate with impulsivity, and (3) examine how longitudinal changes in brain signatures of impulsivity are associated with risk for SUD. To accomplish these aims, I will participate in courses and train with collaborators with expertise in developmental neuroscience and in statistical analyses of big data. The skills I learn in the K02 period will be used not only to query the ABCD dataset, but also to enhance the sophistication of neuroimaging analyses of my R01 data and any future data collected in my laboratory. This training will enhance my laboratory by significantly expanding the questions I can address, improving my analytic skills, furthering my ability to collaborate, and providing a foundation for mentoring junior scientists. In the absence of K02 support, I will need to cover my salary through teaching and administrative work, which would detract from my research, training, and mentoring activities. This K02 award will provide protected time to develop my research program and receive this training that will be critical for my career development as an addiction neuroscientist. Project Narrative This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide protected research time for the PI to develop an integrated program of brain-based and behavioral research on substance use disorders (SUD), especially cannabis use disorder (CUD). This award will provide protected time for training in (1) statistical analysis as it pertains to big data, in light of the shift in the neuroimaging field toward large consortia-collected datasets, and (2) developmental neuroscience. This training will enhance the PI’s laboratory through significantly expanding the questions she can address, improving her analytic skills, furthering her ability to collaborate, and providing a solid and growing foundation for mentoring junior scientists.",Using Neuroimaging Markers to Understand Risk Factors and Consequences of Cannabis on Brain Structure and Function,10301282,K02DA052684,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive development', 'detection method', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'marijuana use disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'parallel computer', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'substance use', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2021,128304
"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated.

"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10251022,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2021,137416
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools PROJECT SUMMARY  Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,10117719,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Seizures', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prospective', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific biomarkers', 'technology/technique', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,512781
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,10232380,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386628
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic.  As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to fight against the disease.  This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via a HIPAA compliant secure server to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a secure HIPAA compliant database that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10190370,R01AI127203,"['Big Data', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 surveillance', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Secure', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data warehouse', 'disability', 'fight against', 'health data', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'systems research', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,626275
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,10159277,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,276700
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Super Greedy Trees Project Summary/Abstract We identify critical weaknesses with Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees (CART), a widely used base learner for machine learning of big omic-data analysis, and propose to replace these with a fundamentally different type of base learner we call super greedy trees (SGT's). SGT's cut the space in a fundamentally different manner, resulting in a richer partition structure with provable consistency and superior empirical performance. The project will develop a uniﬁed SGT framework for big data analysis using machine learning including the treatment of time varying covariate survival analysis, unsupervised learning, highly imbalanced data and multivariate regression. The SGT framework will be deployed within scalable and extensible open source software that will allow NIGMS researchers to deploy them to deal with their challenging big data problems.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research.

"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10176406,K25AI153816,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Ships', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Viral', 'Viral Epidemiology', 'Viral Physiology', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'blind', 'career development', 'epidemiological model', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'outbreak prediction', 'parallel computer', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2021,106467
"Big Data Health Science Fellow Program in Infectious Disease Research Abstract The multiple, massive, and rich Big Data streams in healthcare (e.g., electronic health records, mobile technologies, wearable devices, genomic data) and the emergence of advanced information and computational technologies (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence) offer an invaluable opportunity for applying innovative Big Data science research in NIAID focus areas of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. Big Data science has the potential to identify high-risk individuals and communities and prioritize them for early biomedical or public health interventions, predict long-term clinical outcomes and disease progression, and evaluate public health policy impact. Key to addressing these complexities is a critical mass of health researchers with adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to unlock important answers from Big Data to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent these diseases and related comorbidities. However, there is a nationwide shortage of talent with such knowledge, competencies, and skills, especially in traditional academic settings. While junior faculty, as part of the generations of digital learners, have the greatest potential to develop their Big Data health science research agenda, many face multiple structural barriers to conduct Big Data science research. Such barriers include a lack of protected time to initiate new interdisciplinary Big Data research, lack of opportunity to participate in funded Big Data research, and a lack of adequate mentoring. To address these gaps, we propose developing a “Big Data Heath Science Fellow” program for early career junior faculty (i.e., assistant professors) at health science schools (e.g., medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy, social work) at the University of South Carolina (USC). Specifically, we plan to recruit 4 USC health science junior faculty per year and provide them with protected time (25%) to participate in the comprehensive training program, including: 1) courses for competency and skill development in Big Data research and professional development; 2) participation in hands-on research and grant proposal development; and 3) rich mentoring experience in Big Data research and professional development. The proposed training program will be implemented with the support of the existing infrastructure of the USC Big Data Health Science Center (BDHSC), one of USC’s Excellence Initiatives. BDHSC’s mission is to promote and support Big Data health science research at USC and across SC through capacity development, academic training, professional development, community engagement, and methodological advancement. BDHSC contains 5 content cores (electronic health records, geospatial, genomic, social media, and bio-nanomaterial data) and 2 supporting hubs (business/entrepreneurship and technology) with the involvement of 43 faculty from 10 USC college/schools. The proposed training will be an integral component of the BDHSC professional development mission. Upon the accomplishment of the proposed training, each trainee will be expected to: 1) obtain hands- on mentored research experience on an NIAID-funded project; 2) develop at least one Big Data-related manuscript on HIV or COVID-19; and 3) submit one grant application to NIAID or other appropriate funding source. The training program will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science research in HIV, COVID-19, and other NIAID focus areas. Public Health Relevance Statement NIH has identified “workforce development” as one of its 5 strategic goals for biomedical data science in the coming decades and has called for integrative training in data-science approaches through curricula and mentored research. This proposed R25 program is designed to address the nationwide shortage of Big Data health science researchers in NIAID focus areas. The training program will target junior faculty in health science disciplines at the University of South Carolina and will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science research in HIV, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases.",Big Data Health Science Fellow Program in Infectious Disease Research,10311679,R25AI164581,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academic Training', 'Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biometry', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education Projects', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Social Work', 'South Carolina', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Wages', 'Workforce Development', 'big-data science', 'biomedical data science', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'community engagement', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data streams', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'genomic data', 'hands on research', 'health data', 'health science research', 'health training', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'nanobiomaterial', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'social media', 'synergism', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2021,350996
