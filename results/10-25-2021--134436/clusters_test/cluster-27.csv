"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses. The center will also develop new mass spectrometry methods, molecular biology methods, and informatics models to create a platform technology for sub-cellular genomics. Many human diseases, especially neuropsychiatric diseases, can be traced to dysfunction of organelles and other sub-cellular components. This project will create novel technologies to study function and dysfunction of sub-cellular processes and apply them to study of neurons.",Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics,10198973,RM1HG010023,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Depressive disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'informatics tool', 'lipidomics', 'macromolecule', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'nanoscale', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'response', 'subcellular targeting', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'transcriptome', 'welfare', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RM1,2021,500000
"Model organism neural circuit knowledge graph Project Summary To extract greater value from extensive but disparate and siloed data relevant to neural circuits, we will leverage the ontologies, bioinformatics, and curation of the Alliance of Genome Resources to derive an artificial intelligence (AI) ready knowledge graph. Participation of a computational neuroscientist who uses AI for neural circuit analyses will help specify the form of the knowledge graph, demonstrate the utility of the graphs, extend the graphs from a focus on the well-defined nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans to the similarly well- defined mouse retina, and connect with neuroscience researchers who are starting to applying AI to neural circuits. Known entities (such as neurons, small molecules, and neuropeptides) and Ontologies (anatomy, relations, and experimental evidence) provide the underlying data of the graph. Curated assertions provide the knowledge, e.g., synaptic or functional connections between neurons, neuropeptide has a specific receptor, or a neuropeptide is expressed in a specific neuron). In this graph model, entities are the nodes, ontological relationships are the edges. These provide an inferred knowledge graph supported by evidence backed assertions. This type of knowledge graph can be applied to biological pathways that are based on phenotype observations including expression, neuronal activity and organismal behavior rather than physical interactions or enzymatic activities such as those used to describe biochemical pathways. To accomplish generation of knowledge graphs, we will refine the relevant vocabularies to focus on relations used in neural circuit research, we will adjust existing infrastructure to handle the appropriate ontologies, data models, and curation tools for neural circuit data, and we will incentivize expert contributions by arranging short reviews coupled to computable assertions. The knowledge graph will be used by local AI experts, published on the internet, and tested by a hackathon. Project Narrative There are large amounts of high-quality data that are underutilized in our attempt to understand the structure and function of neural circuits. In particular the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches could be enabled by having these data in computable form and available via simple download or application programming interface (API). We will facilitate construction of knowledge graphs for neural circuits, construct graphs for the C. elegans nervous system and the mouse retina, and demonstrate utility by applying AI and ML to those graphs.",Model organism neural circuit knowledge graph,10412857,U24HG010859,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'California', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Graph', 'Incentives', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptide Receptor', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'WormBase', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data curation', 'data modeling', 'efficacy testing', 'genome resource', 'hackathon', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'neural circuit', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U24,2021,259479
"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing. Project Narrative Normal hearing depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate and suppress responses to self-generated vocal sounds, while impaired suppression generates auditory hallucinations. We aim to show how vocal motor signals suppress auditory activity in the brain, thus informing how hearing works in health and disease.",Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing,10121250,R01DC013826,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Hallucination', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bone Conduction', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Courtship', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ultrasonics', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory feedback', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'autoencoder', 'deaf', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neural circuit', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'unsupervised learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429899
"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Ferrets', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operating System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pupil', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virus', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'frontal lobe', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591
"The Circuit Logic of Modulation of Locomotion by Odors 1 There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying even simple naturalistic  2 behaviors, such as making a cup of coffee, which proceed through a sequential execution of sub-behaviors.  3 Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because obtaining a circuit-level understand-  4 ing of complex multi-step behaviors is a necessary step toward unlocking the mysteries of healthy brain func-  5 tion and of disorders. The overarching goal is to obtain a circuit-level understanding of such naturalistic behav-  6 ior. The research objective here is to unravel the logic of sensorimotor transformation in the context of odor-  7 modulation of locomotion in Drosophila. The central hypothesis is that, like many of our own everyday actions,  8 control of odor-modulation of locomotion is hierarchical. A fly’s locomotion is built from simpler elements called  9 locomotor primitives, each of which lasts between 1-3 seconds (or 10-30 steps). Odors, instead of acting on 10 instantaneous locomotor parameters such as speed and angular speed, act on these locomotor primitives and 11 change the probability that the fly spends performing a given locomotor primitive. This hypothesis was formu- 12 lated on the basis of our previous work and preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that 13 understanding odor-guided locomotion—a complex, flexible behavior—in the context of a genetically tractable 14 system will allow a precise delineation of the steps that underlie sensorimotor transformation in the context of a 15 naturalistic behavior. The hypothesis above will be tested by characterizing the circuit basis of modulation of 16 locomotion by food odors using a combination of techniques including imaging, electrophysiology, quantitative 17 behavior and computation. The proposed research has three specific aims. 1) To extract the locomotor primi- 18 tives and test the hypothesis that odors modulate locomotion by changing the time a fly spends performing dif- 19 ferent locomotor primitives. 2) To test the hypothesis that different ORN classes modulate the time spent in 20 distinct locomotor primitives. 3) To elucidate the role of lateral horn in odor modulation of locomotion. The re- 21 search is innovative because it employs sophisticated statistical tool (Hierarchical Hidden Markov model, 22 HHMM) and cutting-edge experimental tools in the context of a genetically tractable model organism to obtain 23 insights into naturalistic behaviors. The proposed research is significant because it will vertical advance our 24 understanding of sensorimotor processes involved in naturalistic behaviors. Insights from multiple fields have 25 all come to the conclusion that behavior is organized into discrete packets or behavioral primitives. Actions un- 26 fold by a sequential recruitment of these discrete packets. A critical barrier to the study of natural behavior is 27 that in most cases there is enough variability in these discrete packets to make them unrecognizable without 28 the help of sophisticated statistical tool. By deploying HHMM, we overcome this critical barrier. Besides repre- 29 senting a vertical advance in our understanding of naturalistic behavior, another possible positive outcome of 30 this study is better diagnosis of neurological conditioning that occur through improper sequencing of actions. 31 32 33 Public health: The ability to execute complex behaviors in response to sensory responses is disrupted in many diseases. In the research proposed here is aimed at understanding the logic underlying the control of complex behavior and how control of complex behaviors is organized in neural circuits which lead to better management of diseases affecting proper execution of behavior.",The Circuit Logic of Modulation of Locomotion by Odors,10132287,R01DC015827,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Instinct', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Locomotion', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'central pattern generator', 'conditioning', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'innovation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NIDCD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,325218
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes. This work forms a basis to study central alterations following noise- induced hearing loss or other cochlear pathology, and gain deeper understanding of all auditory structures from brainstem to cortex.",The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus,10131580,R01DC015901,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'CNS processing', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear nucleus', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Octopus', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'afferent nerve', 'auditory processing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell type', 'cellular targeting', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'granule cell', 'health goals', 'human error', 'in silico', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular scale', 'nanoscale', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recombinase', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2021,620597
"Neuronal population coding: from vision to decision Project summary  A very large number of studies have investigated the relationship between the activity of sensory neurons and behavior. The model that implicitly or explicitly guides most of that work is that single neurons are the unit of computation. The underlying hypothesis is that different groupings of neurons are responsible for each sensory, cognitive or premotor role in decision-making. However, each neuron's responses encode a unique combination of sensory and cognitive signals as well as noise, and have distinct interactions with the rest of the network. These observations, combined with the staggering flexibility of mappings from sensory stimuli to actions suggest that different weighted sums of the activity of the entire population may be more informative about sensory and behavioral variables than different groupings of neurons.  This idea represents a new way of thinking about neural coding. It has important implications for the neuronal mechanisms underlying many behavioral processes, including perceptual decision-making in the primate visual system, which is our model system. This paradigm can also explain longstanding paradoxes about the aspects of the neural code that limit performance on perceptual tasks.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the aspects of population activity that guide and gate perceptual decisions. We hypothesize that the sensory information that is used to flexibly guide and gate decisions is shared between populations of visual and premotor neurons. The two cornerstones of our approach are 1) to record simultaneously from groups of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT), which encodes visual motion, and in the superior colliculus (SC), whose responses are visual, oculomotor, and everything in between and 2) to use novel measures of neuronal activity that incorporate the activity of the whole population. In Aim 1, we will compare the extent to which individual perceptual decisions can be predicted from the dominant fluctuations in population responses within MT or the SC or activity that is correlated on a trial by trial basis between the two areas. In Aim 2, we will determine whether task-irrelevant stimulus information, which can cause large changes in the activity of sensory neurons, is filtered out by interactions between MT and the SC. In Aim 3, we will conduct a strong test of the hypothesis that visuo-motor interactions guide perceptual decision-making by measuring the relationship between choices and interactions between MT and SC neurons with receptive fields in opposite hemifields.  Together, these studies will address long-standing questions about the extent to which perception is limited by the fidelity with which stimulus information is encoded in sensory cortex or by the information that is flexibly communicated to downstream areas in a task-dependent way. More generally, this work will establish a set of experimental and data analysis techniques for revealing the relationship between neuronal populations and behavior.

"Cortical mechanisms mediating visual function and behavior Project Summary Intracellular recording from sensory cortex provides a window into the synaptic inputs that shape spiking responses of individual cortical neurons, but until recently, this powerful technique has been limited to anesthetized animals. By combining the unique expertise from our laboratories, we have developed a novel technique that allow us to conduct, on a routine basis, reliable, whole-cell intracellular recording in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, behaving macaque monkeys. We combine intracellular recording with an array of concomitant measurements that provide access to the state of the local network in which the neuron is embedded as well as to the internal state of the animal. Using these techniques, we have access to both subthreshold (membrane potentials, representing input) and suprathreshold (spikes, representing output) responses of individual cortical neurons, while also utilizing the precise control of visual stimulation and the subject’s behavioral state afforded by behaving primates. Our ability to perform intracellular recording in awake, behaving primates opens the door to addressing three fundamental questions with respect to the circuit-level mechanisms that mediate visual perception: (1) what are the nature, sources, and behavioral consequences of the large neural variability of sensory cortical neurons, (2) what is the contribution of internal state fluctuations to this variability, (3) what circuit models can account for the observed neural variability during spontaneous and evoked responses? To address these questions, in Aim 1 we will study the quantitative relationship between sub- and suprathreshold activity during spontaneous and stimulus-evoked responses in V1 of fixating monkeys. This will allow us to test the generality of previous findings from anesthetized animals. In Aim 2, we will examine the relationship between the activity of single V1 neurons and perceptual decisions in monkeys that are engaged in a demanding visual detection task. Specifically, we will examine how sub- and suprathreshold responses are altered by changing the attentional and motivational states under which the stimulus is presented. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test a novel set of circuit models that can account for our observed results and guide future experiments. Project Narrative The goals of this proposal are to shed light on the nature, sources, and behavioral consequences of the large neural variability of sensory cortical neurons, the contribution of internal state fluctuations to this variability, and to generate cortical circuit models that account for the observed neural variability. Our three laboratories have developed a computational and experimental strategy leveraging our ability to perform whole-cell intracellular recordings in awake, behaving animals performing well-controlled and demanding visual tasks.

"Image-based modeling of functional connectivity in neural networks at single-cell resolution Project Summary/Abstract Calcium fluorescence imaging has opened unprecedented opportunities to investigate how neurons are wired in circuits that plastically process information in the brain. Recent advances in microscopy and genetically encoded calcium indicators allow us to record in real time the transient rises of intracellular Ca2+ for a large population of neurons during their electrical activity. However, little is known about mechanisms of information processing in neural circuits at the single neuron level. Even though cutting-edge technologies are capable of optically probing thousands of neurons firing in relation to stimulation or behavior output, we are still unable to track the propagation of the neuron firing events. The key barrier to progress is the lack of computational technologies in image and signal processing for the calcium imaging data. A common but unresolved obstacle to collect calcium activities of neurons from acquired images is deformation of live tissues during imaging. The goal of the project for image processing is to develop an algorithm to automatically extract accurate traces of single-neuron activity from deforming 3D calcium images. A new approach under development generates a dynamic region-of-interest for each jittering and blinking neuron by iteratively learning neuronal identities from local images of firing neurons. As a next step, the goal for signal processing is to develop statistical inference frameworks that can assess the evidence of information flows from external stimuli to sensory neurons, and between interconnected neurons. The responsiveness of neurons upon stimulation will be statistically determined based on an autoregressive hidden Markov model. We will identify causal hierarchy among neuronal activities using Granger-causality inference, in order to reconstruct the functional connectivity networks for large-scale neuronal populations. Subsequent graph theoretical quantification of the connectivity networks at the single-neuron level will enable us to differentiate wiring architectures of neural circuits under different molecular conditions. The long-term career goal of the candidate, Dr. Noh, is to establish an independent research program specialized in image-based stochastic modeling of dynamic nervous systems by translating his expertise in statistics and time series analysis. The training objective of this proposal is to allow Dr. Noh to make a unique contribution to computational methods for complex neuroimaging data and its dynamics, and to train Dr. Noh to gain the ability to conduct hypothesis-driven research for neuroscience by himself. The proposed training is guided by Gaudenz Danuser and Julian Meeks, who are leaders in the fields of computational cell biology and neurobiology, respectively. Being engaged in diverse environment of informatics/experiments and neurobiology, Dr. Noh will immerse himself into neuroscience, acquire experiential learning of neuroimaging experiments, and gain expertise in multidisciplinary team science. The completion of this proposal will enable Dr. Noh not only to establish his groundwork for research in neuroimaging, but also to play leading roles in multidisciplinary research. Project Narrative This project develops computational methods to analyze calcium fluorescence imaging data which display thousands of neurons firing and communicating with each other in live tissues or brain of animals. After redesigning the mathematical methods employed for analyzing dynamic economic quantities, we track propagation of the neuronal firing events to better understand brain function. The methods under development will enable researchers to decode collective calcium activities and understand wiring patterns of individual neurons in neural circuits from the calcium imaging data, and consequently it will help us early detect neurological diseases.",Image-based modeling of functional connectivity in neural networks at single-cell resolution,10266100,K25EB028854,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accessory Olfactory Bulbs', 'Active Learning', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'reproductive', 'response', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vomeronasal organ']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2021,126900
"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Drug Screening', 'Endoderm', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth Factor', 'Guide RNA', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'control theory', 'design', 'engineering design', 'extracellular', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'self assembly', 'self organization', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell population', 'synthetic biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610
"Optoretinography: All-optical measures of functional activity in the human retina Project Summary/Abstract The last few decades have seen major inroads into detailing the physiological mechanisms supporting vision as well as therapies aimed at rescue and repair of neurons affected by retinal diseases. For the continued evolution of treatments and their rapid translation to the clinic, it is essential to find a non-invasive, all-optical biomarker to monitor the efficacy of disease and potential therapeutic agents. To this end, we propose to develop the optoretinogram, or ORG, the optical analog to the electroretinogram (ERG) which is the current gold standard for retinal function assessment in humans. The ORG is rooted in classical interferometry and enables a highly sensitive assay of how neurons interact with light. Using this technique, our group has demonstrated the ability to visualize light-driven neural activity across a range of spatiotemporal resolution – from single cells to a collection of neurons, and from µsecs to ms timescales. Here, we aim to expand the capabilities of the ORG and demonstrate its efficacy for basic science and clinical applications. The proposed technology is built upon a solid foundation of established approaches, and combines them in new and complementary ways to achieve an optimal combination of speed, resolution and sensitivity geared towards overcoming the key challenges faced with imaging cellular structure-function in humans. The core technologies are phase-resolved OCT, an eye-safe, interferometric method to measure nm-scale changes at ms time scales in vivo, adaptive optics (AO) to overcome ocular aberrations, increase the signal-to-noise and allow resolution down to single cells and real-time eye tracking to overcome eye motion and allow targeting, recording and averaging of responses from single and a collection of retinal neurons. These are implemented across three ORG platforms. At the University of Washington, we will refine the line-scan phase-resolved OCT with improvements in optical design and eye-tracking and use it to characterize the basic properties of phototransduction and inner retinal function in healthy human volunteers and patients with retinal degenerations. At Stanford University, we will develop a similar line-scan system for rodents, and together with transgenic models and pharmacology, determine the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the ORG and develop templates for human recordings. At UC Berkeley, we will push the envelope of speed and sensitivity by incorporating a real-time eye-tracking system to drive an AO-OCT interferometric probe, with the aim to measure the tiniest and briefest neuronal changes in the human retina. This bioengineering research partnership will benefit from complementary expertise, research direction and ORG implementation across the three sites, and the use of common approaches for image/data analysis, eye tracking and visual stimulation. Ultimately, the aggregate technology will facilitate a deeper mechanistic understanding of early visual processing and eye disease, and provide entirely new avenues for accelerating therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative This proposal outlines a plan to develop the technology for measuring the Optoretinogram, or ORG: the all- optical recording of functional activity of retinal neurons and their connections in a living eye. We employ a unique combination of technologies (OCT, adaptive optics, interferometry, eye-tracking) that together enable in vivo access to the early visual processing elements in the retina in humans. In the end, we envision powerful, clinically deployable tools suited to test and accelerate the new generation of treatments aimed at regenerating neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system.",Optoretinography: All-optical measures of functional activity in the human retina,10295296,U01EY032055,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroretinography', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interferometry', 'Ions', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Photoreceptors', 'Phototransduction', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transgenic Model', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'adaptive optics', 'adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy', 'analog', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'ganglion cell', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'inherited retinal degeneration', 'millisecond', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'mutant', 'nanometer', 'non-invasive imaging', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'retinal neuron', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'visual dysfunction', 'visual processing', 'visual tracking']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2021,1037920
"Brain-wide Neuronal Circuit Mapping with X-ray Nano-Holography Project Summary This proposal's objective is to develop synchrotron-based X-ray imaging technologies to enable high-resolution imaging of brain-wide neuronal circuits. Comprehensively mapping brain-wide circuits is not currently feasible, even in small mammalian model systems, because light microscopy (LM) lacks sufficient resolution and electron microscopy (EM) cannot be applied over large volumes. Leveraging the unprecedented qualities of the new 4th generation synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron, we will develop X-ray nano-holography (XNH) imaging techniques for large-scale imaging of brain circuits. Taking advantage of improvements in source coherence and brightness, we will improve imaging resolution to allow direct visualization of synaptic connections between neurons, and develop imaging protocols that allow imaging of centimeter-scale circuit volumes within a typical beamline experiment. We will combine non- destructive XNH with EM and LM imaging techniques to rigorously and quantitatively validate the accuracy of XNH- based circuit reconstruction. We will then use this correlative workflow to study the relationships between long-range sensory inputs, local synaptic micro-circuitry, and single-neuron activity, investigating how circuits in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) support perceptual decision-making. Lastly, we will apply XNH circuit-mapping over an entire cortical hemisphere, and utilize deep-learning based machine vision algorithms to obtain a comprehensive atlas of cortical connectivity. This atlas will in principle resolve all long-range connections between cortical areas at single-axon resolution, lending insight into how distinct cortical areas achieve specialized function, and how distributed cortical networks support cognition and are affected by psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative  Mapping the complex wiring between neurons can help us understand how brain circuits work a fundamental level, but is not possible with current imaging technologies. In this project, we will develop a synchrotron-based X-ray imaging approach that has the potential to enable rapid brain-wide circuit mapping.

"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Death Inhibition', 'Cell fusion', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Ganglia', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhibition of Apoptosis', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroepithelial', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neuropil', 'New York', 'Optic Lobe', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Transcript', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'developmental neurobiology', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroblast', 'neuroepithelium', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinotopic', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'somatosensory', 'stem cell division', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-photon']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,10225560,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,235907
"CRCNS: Reward and motivation in neural networks  The overall goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) theory of motivation, understood here as motivational salience, and to test the conclusions of this theory using experimental observations obtained in the ventral pallidum (VP). Animals' actions depend on the shifting values of internal demands determined by physiological or behavioral conditions, such as thirst, hunger, addiction, specific nutrient deficiency, etc. These need-based modulations of the perceived values of reinforcements (reward or punishment} are described by a mathematical variable called motivational salience or, simply, motivation. Including motivation adds a new level of complexity to RL theory, and allows it to generate flexible ongoing behaviors. Here, we will investigate how motivation can be learned by neuronal networks to generate complex adaptive behaviors and compare the conclusions of our theory with the VP circuits. Previous studies indicate that the VP plays an important role in a variety of behaviors, potentially, by influencing motivational salience. In vivo recordings suggest that VP neuron firing correlates with motivational states. Lesions, pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations in VP cause profound changes in behaviors motivated by natural rewards or drugs of addiction. Dysfunction of this structure is linked to depression and drug addiction in humans. Our theoretical results suggest that distinct classes of neurons in the VP should play essential roles in representing either positive or negative motivational states. We further hypothesize that the functional interactions locally within the VP are critical for generating such signals that guide motivated behaviors. Consistent with predictions of RL theory, in our preliminary studies, we found that individual VP neurons could be classified as either positive or negative 'motivation neurons', as the activities of these neurons represented both expected values of outcomes and motivational states. When population activity is considered, representations of outcome expectation can be distinguished from representations of motivation fluctuating according to the animals' physiological states. Based on the preliminary data, we devised an integrated approach, combining studies in computational analysis and theory (Koulakov lab) with advanced molecular genetic tools, optogenetics, chemogenetics, electrophysiology, and imaging in behaving mice (Li lab), to test our hypotheses through the following Aims: Aim 1. To develop methods for identifying motivation in the population activity of VP neurons. Here we will use novel behavioral and computational methods to disambiguate representations of motivation and outcome expectation in neuronal responses. Aim 2. To develop reinforcement learning theory of motivation and to test its predictions using responses of VP neurons. Here we will develop the Q-learning theory of motivation and compare networks trained using this theory to responses of VP neurons. Aim 3. To identify the circuit basis of representations of motivation in VP neuronal populations. We will identify the network structure in Q-learning networks with motivation, and test predictions using opto- and chemogenetic manipulations in VP. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The neural mechanisms of motivated behaviors remain unclear. In the proposed research program, we will determine the precise circuit mechanisms and computations by which neurons in the ventral pallidum participate in modulating motivated behaviors. Findings from this project will have important clinical implications, as impairments in motivational processes are core features of depression and drug addiction. n/a",CRCNS: Reward and motivation in neural networks ,10227072,R01DA050374,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thirst', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'computational neuroscience', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'incentive salience', 'learning network', 'mental state', 'motivated behavior', 'motivational processes', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,432000
"Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings Project Summary Opioid overdoses kill more than 130 Americans every day, yielding over 47,500 deaths per year, and the same number of deaths in the 9/11 attacks every 23 days. The best treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are medication-assisted therapies such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, and are inadequate to buttress the epidemic. Failure to treat OUD is sourced in not understanding the molecular pathophysiology of OUD, including its clinical manifestations as a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, the neurobiological mechanisms that reinforce its consumption, and how repeated consumption affects other neurocognitive processes. The Hurd lab recently discovered a genomic locus associated with OUD, downstream of the protein tyrosine-kinase FYN, in striatal neurons from human heroin abusers. Additionally, heroin increased Fyn expression in the striatum of rats that undergo heroin self-administration (SA), and in primary striatal neuronal cultures. FYN phosphorylates tau, and hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to precede neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of neurocognitive disease. This proposal leverages high-throughput electronic medical records (EMR) from the Mount Sinai Health System to examine how chronic opioid exposure affects the odds of neurocognitive disease (NCD) on a population level, and EMR from two other hospitals at Columbia University and the University of San Francisco to replicate these effects, using the same analysis pipeline. Additionally, I propose mechanistic studies of Fyn overexpression in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region known to be affected in NCD and OUD, on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors using animal models. Further, I used a machine learning approach with RNA-seq data obtained from human post-mortem OFC tissue to classify subjects as either belonging to the heroin overdose or control group based on the expression of ~10 genes. Three feature (gene) importance metrics highlighted a transcript, SHISA7, that was reduced in the human OFC, and this finding was replicated in the OFC of rats that underwent heroin self-administration. SHISA7 and FYN both regulate the synaptic function of AMPA receptors, and are components of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic neurons. I will examine the impact of overexpressing SHISA7, identified using this machine learning approach, in the OFC on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors in animal models. Finally, I will conduct RNA-sequencing experiments on the OFC from Fyn- and Shisa7-manipulated animals, and in downstream bioinformatics analyses, parse key drivers of gene networks to identify potential mechanisms that account for the contribution of these genes to heroin SA and cognitive behaviors. High-throughput clinical and gene expression data from the human can inform translational, mechanistic studies using animal models that will enable a far-reaching understanding of the molecular disturbances underlying the effects of opioids on cognition and addiction. Project Narrative The opioid epidemic is killing over 130 Americans every day, and current treatments consist of opioid substitution therapies, which are fraught with challenges and ineffective at slowing the epidemic. Opioid use disorder is a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, and our scientific understanding of it must proceed along multiple dimensions of analysis to elucidate its underlying molecular pathophysiology, with the end goal of formulating novel treatments. This project will gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of how opioids affect cognition and addiction, starting from high-throughput human studies using advanced computational methods, proceeding to mechanistic studies using animal models of reversal learning and heroin self-administration behaviors, and further through deep sequencing and bioinformatics studies to characterize gene networks and key drivers impacted by opioid exposure.",Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings,10150982,F31DA051183,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Epidemic', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FYN gene', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Heroin Users', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Naltrexone', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Opioid replacement therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reversal Learning', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Source', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'heroin abuser', 'heroin overdose', 'human data', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overexpression', 'prescription opioid', 'psychologic', 'synaptic function', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement across the opioid exposure cycle PROJECT SUMMARY Pathological adaptions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system associated with chronic exposure to opioids and opioid withdrawal can dysregulate responsivity to opioids and contextual cue associations. The primary goal of this training proposal is to gain new skills in advanced computational techniques to delineate how functionally diverse subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons are regulated during morphine exposure and the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. Foundational findings have identified the intrinsic and synaptic (glutamatergic and GABAergic) adaptations that VTA dopamine neurons undergo throughout acute and chronic opioid exposure. Yet, few studies have accounted for the functional diversity of VTA dopamine neurons that mediate distinct aspects of cue-reward processing and motivation. Dissociating the potential diversity of VTA dopamine responses in the development of opioid dependence will help unravel the neural basis of the progression of opioid-use disorder. The Zweifel lab has previously used a genetic approach to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons that project to discrete regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons were found to selectively project to the NAc Core (VTACore) and cholecystokinin (Cck)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons selectively project to the NAc medial Shell (VTAmShell). I hypothesize that there exist projection-specific neural and behavioral correlates in response to morphine and during the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. I will investigate this using a systematic approach across three aims. For Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral pharmacology and fiber photometry to determine whether VTACore and VTAmShell dopamine neurons engage in uniform or differential dose-dependent neural activation dynamics in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 2 (K99), I will use my skills in conditioned place preference and in vivo fiber photometry to determine how the VTACore and VTAmShell neurons encode contextual associations to morphine in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 3 (R00), I will determine the basis of these pathological adaptations in VTA dopamine subpopulations by dissecting the role mu-opioid receptor (MOR)- sensitive GABAergic inputs play in morphine contextual associations. During the K99 mentored phase, I will gain new scientific training in Dr. Larry Zweifel’s laboratory, augmented by my advisory committee, in computational analytical tools to analyze complex neurophysiological and behavioral data sets. I will also gain new career development training from Dr. Zweifel, my advisory committee, and the MOSAIC UE5 program that will facilitate my transition into a successful independent principal investigator in academia. Importantly, I will continue my work on increasing representation and equity in the biomedical research workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid crisis has inflicted a tremendous socioeconomic burden and resulted in the countless loss of lives. In order to further initiatives geared towards resolving the opioid crisis with novel treatments, basic neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie pathological opioid behaviors need to be elucidated. The goal of this proposal is use combinatorial genetic, photometric, electrophysiological, and machine-learning based behavioral analysis to decode the behavioral and neural correlates of the heterogeneous mesolimbic dopamine system that regulate morphine response and associative learning in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice.",Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement across the opioid exposure cycle,10282160,K99DA054265,"['Abstinence', 'Academia', 'Acute', 'Advisory Committees', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Cholecystokinin', 'Chronic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'Morphine Receptors', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Synapses', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'combinatorial', 'conditioned place preference', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'functional loss', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'mesolimbic system', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neural correlate', 'neuroadaptation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'sensor', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,171937
"Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid addiction is a chronic, progressive disorder that fuels the current US epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Over the years, a tremendous amount of research effort has been devoted to understanding the biological roles of opioid receptors and developing newer generations of synthetic opioids to treat pain and combat opioid addiction. However, given the advancement of contemporary and novel neuroscience technologies, we have the tools to think beyond mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to develop improved OUD therapeutics. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in the brain and to determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to withdrawal-active MOR-expressing cells and axonal output projections, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these input/output maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes within dependence networks using hyper-multiplexed 3D in situ hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro- labeled connections. Finally, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within core regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the population activity— at cellular resolution—across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. Our models will provide formal summaries of activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure and withdrawal, and our datasets will be made publicly available as they are generated. To bridge these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since their discovery almost 50 years ago how opioid receptors facilitate the development of dependence and withdrawal at a circuit level is still not known. To address this question, we will chart the global cell-type identity, shifting connectivity, and ensemble activity of opioidergic networks by examining brains throughout various stages of addiction. By leveraging cutting-edge neuroscience technologies, we will map and profile neuronal ensembles and cell-types that mediate opioid action in the rodent brain.","Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies",10293782,R01DA054374,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Head', 'Image', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Lifestyle-related condition', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'combat', 'control theory', 'endogenous opioids', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroadaptation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'relating to nervous system', 'searchable database', 'synthetic opioid', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virus genetics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516298
"Combined Mechanistic and Input-Output Modeling of the Hippocampus During Spatial Navigation PROJECT ABSTRACT Large-scale realistic model of neuronal network is a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics and cognitive functions. It integrates multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms/processes identified through diverse hypotheses and experimental data into a single platform. However, due to its high complexity and lack of neuron-to-neuron correspondence to experimental data, it is difficult to constrain, validate and optimize such a model using large- scale neural activities recorded from behaving animals, which are most relevant to cognitive processes. We propose to develop a novel modeling paradigm inspired by the generative adversarial network (GAN) to synergistically combine both mechanistic and input-output (machine learning) modeling techniques to build large- scale realistic models that are functionally indistinguishable from actual neuronal networks. We will apply this paradigm to the modeling of the hippocampus to reveal how spatial information is encoded and re-encoded in the hippocampal neuronal networks during navigation. Specifically, full-scale mechanistic model of the hippocampus will be constructed as the generative model to simulate how hippocampal circuits generate ensemble spiking activities in response to 2D trajectories during navigation. Large-scale population-level input- output models will be developed to statistically characterize input-output properties of the real hippocampus and the hippocampal mechanistic model. The input-output models of the mechanistic model will be evaluated by a discriminator against the ground truth input-output models of the real hippocampus. This forms the discriminative model that (1) identifies discrepancies between the mechanistic model and the real hippocampus, and (2) guides the optimization/modification of neuron model and connectivity parameters of the generative model. This procedure will be performed iteratively until the discriminator fails to distinguish the generative (mechanistic) model from the real hippocampus. In addition, the modifications to the mechanistic model generated by this paradigm will provide falsifiable predictions that can be further tested experimentally. We expect to use this combined mechanistic and input-output modeling strategy to unveil how (1) causal relations between spiking activities across different hippocampal subregions, and (2) place fields of hippocampal neurons, are determined by multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms and the interplay between these mechanisms. The proposed methodology will provide a general computational framework for integrating biological knowledge, hypotheses, and large-scale input-output data to gain deeper and more quantitative understanding of cognitive functions.

"Multiscale computational frameworks for integrating large-scale cortical dynamics, connectivity, and behavior Project Summary/Abstract A central problem in neuroscience is to understand how activity arises from neural circuits to drive animal behaviors. Solving this problem requires integrating information from multiple experimental modalities and organization levels of the nervous system. While modern neurotechnologies are generating high-resolution maps of the brain-wide neural activity and anatomical connectivity, novel theoretical frameworks are urgently needed to realize the full potential of these datasets. Most state-of-the-art methods for analyzing high-dimensional data are based on detecting correlations in neural activity and do not provide links to the underlying anatomical connectivity and circuit mechanisms. As a result, conclusions derived with these methods rarely generalize across different behaviors and are hard to validate in perturbation experiments. In contrast, mechanistic theories, which combine connectivity, activity, and function, have been highly successful in understanding function of small neural circuits. Conditions under which insights from small circuits scale to large distributed circuits have not been explored. Mechanistic theories informed by multiple data modalities are critically missing to guide experiments probing global neural dynamics on the brain-wide scale. The main goal of this proposal is to develop computational frameworks for modeling global neural dynamics, which utilize anatomical connectivity and predict rich behavioral outputs on single trials. Our project will address two complementary aims. First, we will take advantage of recently available datasets of high-resolution brain- wide neural activity and anatomical connectivity to construct a multiscale model of functional dynamics across the mouse cortex. Integrating measurements across multiple scales, from mesoscopic to near-cellular resolution, we aim to reveal the effective degrees of freedom at each scale, which constrain global neural dynamics and drive rich patterns of behavior. Second, we will leverage techniques from dynamical systems theory and artificial recurrent neural networks to develop circuit reduction methods that infer interpretable low-dimensional circuit mechanisms of cognitive computations from high-dimensional neural activity data. Rather than merely detecting correlations, our method infers the structural connectivity of an equivalent low-dimensional circuit that fits projections of high-dimensional neural activity data and implements the behavioral task. We will apply this method to multi-area neural activity recordings from behaving animals to reveal distributed circuit mechanisms of context-dependent decision making. The computational frameworks developed in this proposal can be validated in perturbation experiments and extended to other nervous systems and behaviors. Project Narrative Neural signals related to behavioral and cognitive functions are widespread across the distributed circuitry of the mammalian brain. We will take advantage of recently available high-resolution datasets of brain-wide neural activity and anatomical connectivity to develop mathematical models that integrate multiple data modalities to predict global neural dynamics and rich patterns of behavioral outputs. Our research will produce analytical tools capable to reveal distributed circuit mechanisms underlying behavioral and cognitive functions that are distorted in mental disorders.","Multiscale computational frameworks for integrating large-scale cortical dynamics, connectivity, and behavior",10263628,RF1DA055666,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dorsal', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Problem Solving', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'mathematical model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurotechnology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2021,1440000
"Robust modeling of within- and across-area population dynamics using recurrent neural networks Over the past several decades, the ability to record from large populations of neurons (e.g., multi-electrode arrays, neuropixels, calcium imaging) has increased exponentially, promising new avenues for understanding the brain. These data have the promise to provide a qualitatively different view of activity within and across brain areas than was previously possible, but the effort will require the development of advanced analytical tools. One natural framework is provided by the tools of dynamical systems, which offer the means to uncover coordinated time-varying activation patterns expressed across an interconnected network of recorded neurons, and to characterize how these patterns relate to behavior. This framework has provided fundamental new insights into information processing in these cortical circuits, including those underlying motor, sensory, and cognitive processes. However, previous analytical approaches to uncovering dynamics have typically been developed and tested in specific brain areas, for limited behaviors, in restricted behavioral settings. Ironically, it is not unusual for these methods to have 10^5 parameters that need to be set or learned, and require careful tuning to properly function. Yet the brain is not homogenous, and it is unclear how well these approaches can be made to generalize to a variety of brain areas and behaviors, let alone by researchers who are not intimately familiar with the methods. Further, assuming that the brain's dynamics stem from independent, isolated areas is a vast oversimplification. Clearly, perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions all rely on activity distributed across multiple, interacting brain areas, each of which likely has distinct dynamics. Communication between areas is a dynamic process that underlies flexible function. There is growing recognition that population dynamics are specifically structured to support inter-area interaction, and an immediate need for methods to accurately uncover dynamics between interacting areas.  We will address the challenge of generalized applicability to diverse brain areas by developing a powerful new open-source toolkit for automated discovery of neural population dynamics, within highly divergent brain areas. Further, we will extend this toolkit with new neural network architectures to model the dynamics between interacting areas. Our approach, the Dynamical Systems ID toolkit (DSID), will support accurate and straightforward application to data from different brain areas and behaviors without requiring great expertise or infrastructure setup. DSID will leverage sequential autoencoders (SAEs), powerful and flexible deep learning architectures that use recurrent neural networks to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems. We will validate the generalizability of DSID using a combination of previously-collected and new multi-electrode recording data from monkeys, including motor, sensory, and cognitive areas of cortex. Following their development and validation in our labs, we will work to disseminate them throughout the appropriate research communities where we expect they will be further developed with application to an even broader range of brain areas and behaviors.

"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactivity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
"CRCNS: Age-related changes to cortical dynamics underlying working memory Normal aging in primates often leads to impaired cognitive function, particularly in working memory (WM), which begins to decline in middle-age. Cognitive changes correlate with structural and functional changes to neurons and white matter pathways in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area that is a key player in WM. However, we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how the changes at the single-cell and pathway level impact network function and thus WM performance. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex is only one node in a distributed network of brain regions that contributes to WM, and aging also alters these other –particularly fronto-parietal and visual– areas and long-range inter-areal connections. The central goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying WM as well as the age- related changes to this executive function in the rhesus monkey model of normal aging. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that WM arises through coordinated interaction of visual and fronto-parietal brain regions, and that aging-related decline in WM results from changes to both local circuit dynamics and inter-area communication. Our interdisciplinary approach will combine psychophysical, anatomical and physiological experiments with theory and computational modeling, taking advantage of the complementary expertise of the collaborating laboratories. The proposed research has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify aging effects on individual neurons, white matter pathways and resting state fMRI activity in fronto-parietal and visual cortices. Aim 2: Develop a multi-area computational neural network model in which WM function emerges from interacting distributed circuits. Aim 3: Model-based interpretation and experimental validation of the neuronal mechanisms underlying age-related WM decline.  Public health relevance related to the NIA mission: This project will reveal mechanisms underlying WM and selective age-related changes to WM due to neuronal dysfunction and predict mechanisms that may compensate for these changes to restore function at the cellular, circuit and cognitive level and the quality of life. It thus has broad implications for strategies to enhance brain function in the rapidly increasing population of normally aging individuals. Unique to this proposal is our use of state-of-the-art multiscale anatomical, physiological, and computational approaches in behaviorally characterized rhesus monkeys. These data are critically needed for targeted therapies to prevent detrimental structural and functional brain changes in normal aging.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10242930,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,664653
"Plasticity of cortical circuits in health, aging, and Alzheimer's disease Project Summary/Abstract  Comprised of six distinct layers, the cerebral cortex is the key brain structure for all of our cognitive abilities, ranging from sensation to decision making to movement. Each layer contains distinct cell types differing in their genes, biophysical properties, and connectivity with other parts of the nervous system. Yet how these diverse cortical layers and cell types are involved in any given behavior remains unresolved. Moreover, we currently lack insight into how aging impacts interactions between cortical layers, which severely limits our understanding of how aging alters cortical circuit function. At the most basic level, the cortex can be divided into deep and superficial layers, each of which receives a complete copy of sensory information from the thalamus. This suggests that the two sets of layers constitute different processing systems, which begs the question: what are the possible purposes of these parallel networks? Because these processing streams differ in input, output, intrinsic membrane, synaptic integration, and spike generation properties, I hypothesize that deep and superficial layers have unique, independent functions. This also raises the intriguing possibility that these pathways are differentially susceptible to aging. I hypothesize that aging leads to layer-specific changes that ultimately lead to unique age-related deficits in cortical circuit function.  Investigating the functions and age-related changes in deep and superficial cortical networks requires a cortex-dependent task. In Dr. Bruno’s lab at Columbia University (F99), I developed a whisker-mediated texture discrimination task for head-fixed mice, demonstrated that this behavior requires the cortex, and revealed that both deep and superficial layers are involved in processing texture information (Aim 1.0, progress report). I propose to characterize the sensorimotor strategies required for this behavior (Aim 1.1) and how layer-specific manipulations alter texture representation in the deep and superficial layers (Aim 1.2). Understanding the computations performed by individual layers will not only expand our understanding of the complex cortical circuitry, but will also provide insight into how aging and neurodegeneration – which often involve dysfunction of specific cortical cell types, layers, and their pathways – may be mitigated through the development of targeted therapies. In Dr. Tsai’s lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (K00), I will develop a novel therapy that galvanizes the brain’s own mechanisms to noninvasively improve cognitive and behavioral health in aged and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice. To do so, I will first identify how aging and AD alter learning, performance, sensorimotor strategies (Aim 2.1), and sensory processing across cortical circuits (Aim 2.2) on my texture discrimination task. These findings will inform the development of a noninvasive therapy that stimulates cortical circuits to protect sensory and motor functions from aging and AD pathology (Aim 2.3). This proposal will advance our limited understanding of how aging dynamically alters cortical circuits in vivo and may lead to an effective intervention to prevent age and disease-related functional impairments in human patients. Project Narrative  The cerebral cortex is instrumental to all human and animal cognition, ranging from sensation to decision making to movement. The complexity of cortical circuits is a major obstacle to both understanding cortical function as a whole and to treating maladies that might afflict it, including numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. The proposed studies will reveal how cortical circuits interact to execute cortical computations, how these interactions are impaired by aging and neurodegeneration, and how we can noninvasively stimulate cortical circuits to galvanize the brain to fight against pathologies caused by aging and Alzheimer’s disease.","Plasticity of cortical circuits in health, aging, and Alzheimer's disease",10291327,F99AG073558,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Fingers', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Massachusetts', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Progress Reports', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'behavioral health', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'convolutional neural network', 'density', 'effective intervention', 'extracellular', 'falls', 'fight against', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'synaptic pruning', 'targeted treatment']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F99,2021,47536
"Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit Project Summary/Abstract Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse. However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are implemented in neural systems. Project Narrative Although the ability of the nervous system to predict sensory input is critical for accurate perceptions, coordinated movements, and normal cognitive function, detailed accounts of the underlying neural circuitry and plasticity are lacking. This proposal addresses this challenge by applying novel experimental approaches and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system where neural correlates for learned predictions are highly accessible to mechanistic investigation. The detailed circuit-level models we plan to develop will provide a foundation for understanding how disruptions of predictive mechanisms contribute to neurological disorders.",Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit,10206425,R01NS075023,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Electric Fish', 'Electric Organ', 'Electrodes', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immobilization', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mormyridae', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Posture', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Swimming', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,538626
"Extension of NEURON simulator for simulation of reaction-diffusion in neurons Development of simulation bioengineering techniques in medical neuroscience has been limited due to  computational neuroscience's focus on the higher capacities of humans, such as the ability to play  chess or go. That has led to the notion that the brain can best be understood by recourse to the  concepts of computer science: artificial neural networks, information theory, Bayesian inference,  pattern recognition, etc. Whether or not these tools are sufficient for understanding human  neocortical function, they are clearly not sufficient for understanding the nervous system  dysfunction seen in neurological and psychiatric pathology. Brain disease, like diseases of other  organ systems, is disease of biological tissue, and must eventually consider energetics and  oxygenation, blood and brain pressures, as well as chemical reactions and diffusion of toxins and  pharmaceuticals. Such full-organ simulation will require linkages to other simulators. Through such  linkages, as well as through internal extensions, we have been extending the widely-used NEURON  simulator to handle reaction-diffusion in neural tissue in order to better understand brain  signaling, neurodegenerative toxic cascades, and drug effects. For the current funding period we  will further augment NEURON's NRxD module through 4 Aims: 1. Improve synaptic modeling techniques  by considering presynaptic volume, cleft and postsynaptic volume together to handle ionotropic  synapses, metabotropic synapses, gap junctions and complex combination synapses; along with  reuptake, diffusion, electrodiffusion, neurotransmitters, second messengers and retrograde  neurotransmitters in a coordinated way. 2. Allow more rapid and more extensive exploration of  parameter space by improving simulation speed and by allowing full state variable saving for  improved simulation initialization and recovery from high-performance computing failures. 3.  Develop both Python-based and socket-based application programming interfaces (APIs) for easier  linkage with other simulators, including for electrodiffusion and for various types of stochastic  simulation. 4. Continue package dissemination and education in order to get more computational and  experimental NRxD users. We will continue to offer twice-yearly tutorials, and to sponsor  additional workshops at Computational Neuroscience  and at other meetings. We will integrate online  tutorials with the documentation to provide both Programmer's Reference and Biological Reference  online manuals. We will develop a set of video tutorials associated with these that will eventually  be linked together to make an online course. Overall, we expect that our novel simulation  neurotechnology will be of increasing use and utilization both for research use, and for future  clinical adoption in personalized medicine. Narrative The enormous complexity of brain interactions makes understanding brain diseases such as stroke, autism, and Alzheimer disease extremely difficult. Part of this complexity lies in the need to understand how the chemicals that underlie learning and memory, and brain energy, interact with the electrical signals that travel along nerve fibers. We are extending NEURON, one of the most widely used nerve and brain computer simulators, to simulate chemical reactions both inside and outside of cells. This will allow us to better understand the roles of oxygen, toxins and drugs in brain dysfunctions of neurological and psychiatric disease.",Extension of NEURON simulator for simulation of reaction-diffusion in neurons,10299041,R01MH086638,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computers', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Edema', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equation', 'Extracellular Space', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gatekeeping', 'Genome', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Intracellular Space', 'Ischemia', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'artificial neural network', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'body system', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain research', 'chemical reaction', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neglect', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'online course', 'online tutorial', 'personalized medicine', 'postsynaptic', 'pressure', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'reuptake', 'simulation', 'syntax', 'synuclein', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,426388
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255
"Investigating functional development of neural circuits specified by the gs homeobox transcription factors in larval zebrafish Project Summary: Many questions remain about the genetic mechanisms that when gone awry, lead to neuroanatomical and behavioral deficits associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD that are typically diagnosed years past birth. Identifying these critical gene networks is one key to developing meaningful early diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the negative symptoms of these disorders. My long-term goal is to characterize causative genetic mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders using a combination of model systems approaches, molecular tools, and behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses. The zebrafish provides a unique opportunity as an easily accessible, vertebrate genetic model system with a comparatively “simple” nervous system, rapid neurodevelopment, many orthologues of human disease-related genes, and defined and tractable behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. They are also a relatively accessible animal model system for students at various educational levels to use. We can begin to study specific classes of neurons based on their molecular identity and function from the moment that they are born in the embryo through adulthood in rapid time compared to other animal models. My previous work revealed for the first time the molecular identity of key interneurons that mediate sensory processing and reflexive control in mouse and zebrafish. Larval zebrafish with ablated gsx1-expressing neurons have altered sensory motor gating, a phenotype we also found in Gsx1 KO mice to link neurons derived from this developmental genetic network to this clinically relevant behavioral paradigm. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine the role that the gs homeobox genes (gsx1 and gsx2) play in specifying these brainstem and other gsx1/2-derrived interneurons in other brain regions through analysis of neuronal differentiation, cell survival, and proliferation combined with sensory-mediated behavior testing of gsx1/2 zebrafish mutants compared to their wild type siblings. The experiments described in Aim 2 will determine the changes in gene expression that occur in the gsx1/2 zebrafish mutant CNS using state of the art transcriptome profiling at different developmental time points in addition to validating already identified putative, disease-relevant target genes for Gsx1 and Gsx2 that we uncovered by mining the literature in the lab as part of several undergraduate and graduate student projects to date. We will be able to perform these experiments and analyze and validate the large amount of data that will be generated under the expert guidance of genomics and bioinformatics core facilities at WVU. As these studies are based on subsets of interneurons with defined molecular identity and critical functions, they will provide insight into the complex genetic etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders in which patients have defects in sensory- processing comorbid. In addition, they will provide an abundance of data that can be utilized to support future student-driven research projects in the lab that align well with our broader goals. Project Narrative: Human neurodevelopmental disorders occur in part from disruptions to gene regulatory networks that contain important transcription factors that have similar developmental expression patterns and functions from zebrafish to mammals. This application seeks to uncover novel genetic mechanisms for the establishment of the initial identity, connectivity, and function of molecularly identifiable interneurons that are required for normal sensory processing and reflexive control. This work should provide key insights into therapeutically targetable gene networks that are disrupted to lead to brain disease states with frequent comorbid sensory processing deficits as reported in patients with and animal models of many neurodevelopmental disorders.",Investigating functional development of neural circuits specified by the gs homeobox transcription factors in larval zebrafish,10114516,R15HD101974,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Birth', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Embryo', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homeobox', 'Homeobox Genes', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reflex control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'axon guidance', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'brain size', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'developmental genetics', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'sensory stimulus', 'superior colliculus Corpora quadrigemina', 'synaptogenesis', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R15,2021,455337
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,386750
"Circuit mechanisms underlying learned changes in persistent neural activity ABSTRACT Persistent neural activity, a sustained response following brief stimuli that is observed in many brain networks, needs to be appropriately tuned to meet the exacting demands of various motor and cognitive tasks. One task that has been particularly amenable to understanding persistent neural activity is the oculomotor control of gaze position. In the oculomotor system, where persistent activity maintains the appropriate gaze angle necessary for high-acuity vision, this tuning arises in large part through an interaction loop between the cerebellum and the oculomotor neural integrator, a brainstem structure that temporally integrates eye velocity commands to generate eye position encoding signals. Whereas we understand a fair bit about the coding properties and signal transformations within the cerebellum and especially the neural integrator proper, the interactions between these key brain centers is poorly understood. Here we aim to close this gap through an integrative approach using a combination of whole-network two-photon imaging, targeted optical perturbations, serial-section electron microscopy, in-vivo electrophysiology, and next-generation network modeling. In Aim 1, we will combine volumetric imaging of neuronal dynamics in the zebrafish with learning and targeted perturbations to examine the causal relationships between cerebellar and integrator populations. In Aim 2, we will perform high-resolution serial-section electron microscopy of a functionally imaged brain to gain insight into the global circuit's anatomical connectivity. In Aim 3, we will directly fit a network model to these dynamical and structural data to find the physiological interaction patterns in the circuit and predict the sites of plasticity. In Aim 4, we will probe predicted sites of plasticity using cell-targeted optical stimulations and whole-cell patch recordings. These tools and results will enable concrete predictions about the circuit mechanisms tuning persistent neural activity, guide understanding of the modular loops between the cerebellum and a wide range of other brain areas, and serve as a benchmark for efforts to understand the dynamics and plasticity of interactions across the brain. NARRATIVE The tuning of persistent neural activity, a sustained network response following brief stimulation, is important for a range of behaviors from sensorimotor integration to decision making. In this proposal we will combine whole-network imaging, optical perturbations, serial-section electron microscopy, next-generation network modeling, and whole-cell patch electrophysiology to determine the circuit mechanisms underlying the tuning of persistent activity.",Circuit mechanisms underlying learned changes in persistent neural activity,10075328,R01NS104926,"['Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemosensitization', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic Markers', 'Image', 'Information Storage', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'activity marker', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell type', 'cognitive task', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'eye velocity', 'gaze', 'hindbrain', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'network models', 'next generation', 'oculomotor', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality environment']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,797236
"Principles of multi-whisker stimulus integration in rodent somatosensory cortex Project Summary Integration of sensory signals is crucial for sensory processing in the brain. Rodent whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) provides a powerful system to study this, because neurons integrate tactile information across a discrete array of whiskers. S1 circuitry is well characterized, but tactile representation remains poorly understood. Most studies have focused S1 encoding of single-whisker deflections. This stimuli elicit low-probability spiking, relatively weak somatotopic tuning, and highly similar receptive fields and maps in thalamus and across cortical layers. This weak- redundant code suggests that S1 neurons may code for more complex stimuli than single-whisker deflections. My project tests whether S1 neurons code for multi-whisker stimuli, which are generated during natural whisker sensation. I propose that multi-whisker tuning is achieved by linear and non-linear integration and that multi- whisker features are represented in a novel topographic map in S1. Aim 1 describes past work in which I extensively characterized multi-whisker tuning to 2-whisker sequences, which represent a tractable and important subset of multi-whisker stimuli. I discovered that many neurons have strong spatiotemporal tuning for specific 2- whisker sequences at specific inter-whisker-deflection-intervals (Δt). I found that a combination of linear and nonlinear mechanisms construct and enhance spatial selectivity, with prominent sublinear suppression of non-preferred stimuli. I also discovered principles governing Δt tuning and that it enhances spatial selectivity for 2-whisker sequences, thus defining general computations underlying multi-whisker integration In Aim2, I will use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging to determine the representation of 2-whisker sequences at the population level. While neurons in L2/3 of S1 are highly intermixed by single-whisker tuning (Sato et al. 2007, Clancy KB et al. 2015), I propose that discrete cortical columns will be apparent if receptive fields are defined in terms of 2-whisker sequences. My results suggest that the edges of each column will be defined by a ring of spatiotemporally selective neurons that form discrete borders between columns through sharp differences in Δt tuning. Also, by imaging many neurons simultaneously, I will test whether firing correlations between spatiotemporally selective and non-selective units provide a robust population level code for 2-whisker sequences. This will greatly strengthen our understanding of how S1 represents multi-whisker stimuli. In Aim 3, I plan to extend my study of active sensory systems by studying the role of motor circuits in perception during active sensation. Overall, my research plan will contribute significantly to understanding how the brain integrates sensory and motor signals to generate accurate percepts of the world. Project Narrative The everyday lives of people with sensory disabilities, like blindness, are constantly challenged by their inability to fully perceive the world. This work identifies general mechanisms that the brain uses to represent the world by determining how it integrates sensory information from receptors like the fingertips. Understanding how the brain represents the sensory world will enable development of new strategies to bypass sensory dysfunction.",Principles of multi-whisker stimulus integration in rodent somatosensory cortex,10106683,K00NS105186,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cortical Column', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'base', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'haptics', 'improved', 'novel', 'post-doctoral training', 'preference', 'receptive field', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory system', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,K00,2021,62343
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'rabies viral tracing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,10199070,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2021,2989579
"Studying perceptual decision-making across cortex by combining population imaging, connectomics, and computational modeling Project Summary During perceptual decision-making, populations of neurons, arranged in highly interconnected microcircuits, work together to encode sensory stimuli and to transform sensory perception into appropriate behavioral choices. A fundamental gap in our knowledge about perceptual decision-making is understanding how the connectivity in cortical microcircuits shapes dynamics and information codes in populations of neurons. This gap has arisen because anatomical connectivity and activity have generally been studied separately, and because a computational framework to understand structure-function relationships in cortical microcircuits is missing. Here, we will assemble a team of researchers with complementary skills to tackle this problem. We will combine approaches to study population coding and dynamics using two-photon calcium imaging during a novel and complex decision task for mice, with measurements of connectivity in the imaged neurons using electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomics. Furthermore, we will use our activity and connectivity data to develop a data-driven model to explore structure-function relationships across cortical microcircuits. We will apply our new approach to investigate how population codes, microcircuit connectivity, and structure- function relationships differ across cortex to perform distinct computational tasks during perceptual decision- making. Although it is well established that sensory and association cortices perform different functions, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these different roles, including distinctions in microcircuit connectivity and population coding schemes. In a first aim, we will compare population codes and microcircuit connectivity for sensory stimuli and behavioral choices in visual cortex (V1; sensory cortex) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC; association cortex). We will use computational tools to examine how distinct coding schemes provide functional benefits. We will use EM connectomics in V1 and PPC for neurons imaged during a perceptual decision task to probe structure-function relationships for stimulus and choice codes. We will develop a data- driven recurrent neural network model to relate connectivity and population activity. In a second aim, we will investigate how neuronal populations transform sensory information into behavioral choices using microcircuit connectivity. We will develop a new statistical concept – intersection information – to identify activity patterns in V1 and PPC that carry sensory information that informs behavioral choices. Using EM connectomics, we will reconstruct the microcircuit connectivity between cells to test hypotheses about sensory-to-choice information flow. Our work will be some of the first to compare population coding and microcircuit connectivity across cortical regions and to explore structure-function relationships for perceptual decision-making. Project Narrative Many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, likely result from the disrupted function of neural circuits. The proposed projects will establish novel methods to understand the relationship between connectivity and function in neural circuits to reveal basic principles of neural computation in the mammalian cortex. We expect our projects will help inform how neural circuits are disrupted in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.","Studying perceptual decision-making across cortex by combining population imaging, connectomics, and computational modeling",10242172,R01NS108410,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'connectome data', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'study population', 'synergism', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual coding']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,1143583
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might

all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1

ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐

In accordance with these functions, DA dysfunction is prominently implicated in a wide gamut of disorders affecting tens of millions of people, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, addiction and depression. Understanding how DA neurons control all of these distinct behaviors is important for understanding and treating these neuropsychiatric diseases.  The literature is dominated by anatomical classification of DA neurons based on location within the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) or Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). Guided by an emerging literature on DA neuron heterogeneity, we hypothesize that there must exist several molecularly and functionally distinct DA types, perhaps intermingled, that could underpin the myriad functions of DA. As a first step in classifying DA neurons, the Awatramani lab developed an approach to profile single midbrain DA neurons, each for the expression of 96 key genes, using a microfluidic dynamic RT-qPCR array. Hierarchical clustering indicated that DA neurons exhibited roughly six distinct molecular barcodes, presumably indicative of at least six molecularly and functionally distinct DA subtypes.  The Dombeck laboratory has developed a robust data set demonstrating functional heterogeneity of DA neurons in behaving mice. Previous models postulated that slow variations in tonic firing rates bias the system toward or away from movement, whereas phasic signaling was linked to unpredicted rewards. Using imaging in behaving mice, we showed heterogeneous expression of phasic locomotion and reward signaling in DA axons projecting to the striatum. In the dorsal striatum we found that most DA fibers displayed a phasic signal locked to the animal's cyclic accelerations during locomotion. In the ventral striatum, axonal signaling to unpredicted rewards was more prevalent. These results indicate that striatum DA release is not simply homogenous and movement permissive, but is richly heterogeneous with respect to reward and locomotion signaling.  Based on these complementary data sets- molecular heterogeneity and functional heterogeneity, our goal is to correlate molecular identity with anatomy and function. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the diversity, transcriptomes, and projections of DA neuron subtypes, developing intersectional genetic tools to access DA neuron subtypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish the behavioral signaling properties of the genetically identified DA subtypes that project to the striatum. Thus, using a collaborative approach between two laboratories each with distinct expertise, we aim to characterize DA neuron subtypes based on their molecular, anatomic and functional properties. These studies will be vital for designing targeted therapies for the DA system. Moreover these studies will provide genetic platforms for manipulations of DA subtypes towards understanding their role in mammalian behavior. Narrative Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons underpin a plethora of mammalian behaviors including movement control and reward based learning. The proposed aims seek to deconstruct the midbrain DA system into its constituent components, by identifying molecularly distinct DA neuron subtypes and then characterizing their anatomic projections and functional properties during behavior.","Molecular, anatomic, and functional characterization of midbrain dopamine neuron subtypes",10107852,R01MH110556,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Axon', 'Bar Codes', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Microfluidics', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cohesion', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo imaging', 'millisecond', 'motor learning', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pars compacta', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,679543
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,10224662,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,480000
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,10150927,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,1026631
"Dendritic Computation and Representation of Head Direction in Retrosplenial Cortex The mammalian cortex plays a critical role in integrating multiple streams of information to guide adaptive behavior. For example, head direction (HD) information is combined with visual and spatial input in the mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Accurate integration of these signals is a necessary component of navigation: recognizing a distant landmark while facing north vs. facing south has very different interpretations for one's position and future actions. However, the mechanisms by which any cortical association area integrates different inputs at the level of individual neurons during behavior is unknown. RSC is therefore a compelling model system in which to test general associative computations during a complex behavior: the combination of visual and HD information during navigation.  Anatomical evidence suggests that HD inputs computed in the anterior thalamus make their synapses at distal apical dendrites in RSC, while visual and motor synapses are located closer to the somas of RSC principal neurons. This arrangement suggests that nonlinear dendritic integration may be used by RSC to combine HD with other inputs. Active dendritic integration is theorized to allow single neurons to respond flexibly to different combinations of input, where the state of one input nonlinearly influences the impact of another input. Our overarching hypothesis is that such mechanisms could work in concert with neural circuit computations to implement context-dependent cortical computations. Congruent with this idea, RSC neurons in navigating rats exhibit complex conjunctive receptive fields, a feature that is lacking from commonly studied primary sensory cortices. RSC is therefore an ideal area to evaluate the role of dendrites in associative computations during navigation. However, current methods are not well-suited to this level of investigation: they either allow mice to behave freely or they achieve sub-cellular resolution. This has led to a critical gap in our understanding of navigation, and by extension, associative cortex function. We have recently developed technology that bridges this gap: an animal-actuated rotating headpost that allows mice to engage in 2-D navigation by freely turning their head during conventional 2-photon imaging. We will use this new approach to test the hypothesis that neurons in RSC use sub-cellular processing to flexibly combine HD and visual information during navigation behavior. These experiments will provide new insights into cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms of navigation, and of associative cortical function in general. Results from this project will be valuable for understanding brain disease states as well as for building biologically-inspired artificial neural networks. The brain is a network of staggering complexing, yet each of its elementary units, single neurons, can themselves be seen as a network of sub-modules, performing complex functions such as learning to flexibly integrate multiple inputs. These within-cell computations may play an important role across in a variety of disease states including schizophrenia, ADHD, and Alzheimer’s disease, though, their role in neural circuit function remains poorly understood. This project will apply new tools and approaches to establish the role of dendritic computations during behavior, providing novel insight into general mechanisms of associative cortical function.",Dendritic Computation and Representation of Head Direction in Retrosplenial Cortex,10198060,R01NS113079,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Apical', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Sum', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'cell cortex', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'postsynaptic', 'receptive field', 'sensory cortex', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual information', 'visual motor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,412837
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Sensory', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning', 'design', 'excitatory neuron', 'expectation', 'functional restoration', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'repaired', 'therapeutic target', 'two-photon', 'visual processing']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory-experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work, and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission that pertains to reducing illness and disability.",Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity,10266838,R01NS115800,"['Age', 'Anions', 'Blindness', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cations', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Childhood Injury', 'Chlorides', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Newborn Infant', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Stroke', 'Swelling', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Water Movements', 'base', 'cell type', 'cytotoxic', 'deafness', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'drug development', 'excitotoxicity', 'extracellular', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'neonatal period', 'neonatal seizure', 'neonate', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'prevent', 'symporter', 'water channel', 'water flow']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,423191
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,10086894,R01NS116350,"['ALS pathology', 'ALS patients', 'Address', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Lateral Sclerosis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'functional disability', 'graph theory', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuron loss', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'precision medicine', 'protein TDP-43', 'regional difference', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'stem', 'symptomatology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R01,2021,576665
"THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT Project Summary/Abstract Although HIV-infected patients in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population, they are at a significantly elevated risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Such disorders are the most common neurological complication of HIV disease, with prevalence estimates ranging from 35-70% of all HIV-infected patients, and research targeting such comorbidities has been identified as a top priority by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137). While the mechanisms that underlie HAND are not well understood, numerous human neuroimaging studies have examined the brain regions that may be involved, and overall these studies have been largely successful in identifying the critical hubs and large-scale networks. However, many questions remain regarding basic circuit dysfunction within these brain regions, and consequently there is a clear and common need to further investigate the key physiological parameters that may underlie the development and progression of HAND, especially in the context of aging. It is well known that human cortical neurons exhibit spontaneous firing in the absence of incoming exogenous and endogenous input. Across a neuronal population, these discharges summate with local dendritic currents and synaptic potentials to produce cortical rhythmic activity, which is often referred to as “spontaneous activity.” Such spontaneous rhythms are ubiquitous throughout the human brain, but their role in modulating cognition is only beginning to be understood. Recently, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to show that the strength of spontaneous activity directly affects neural oscillatory activity in the same cortical area, and in-turn modulates real time task performance in controls and HIV-infected adults. Additionally, we have shown that spontaneous activity in multiple brain regions increases with advancing age, that this increase is deleterious to performance, and that these effects are accentuated in patients with HAND. In fact, our preliminary data suggests that the level of spontaneous activity in specific brain regions may distinguish age-matched HIV-infected patients with and without HAND. In this project, we will quantify the trajectory of age-related elevations in spontaneous cortical activity in a large group of HIV-infected adults and demographically-matched controls. We will then evaluate how the strength of such spontaneous activity affects local neural oscillations and real time cognitive performance. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that spontaneous activity will increase with age in both groups, and that the slope of this increase will be steeper in HIV-infected adults relative to controls, and further accentuated in those with HAND. Importantly, we also hypothesize that these increases will be associated with proportional changes in the strength of the neural oscillations underlying cognition, and behavioral performance indices such as accuracy and reaction time. Finally, in Aim 3, we will utilize deep learning methods to classify our sample into groups based on the neurophysiological metrics derived from MEG, with the gold standard being their overall neuropsychological profile. Project Narrative HIV-infection has become a chronic manageable condition with a life expectancy that approaches that of the general population, but affected patients remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive disorders. Previous neuroimaging studies have mapped the brain regions that may be involved in these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders(HAND), and while these studies have been largely successful, many questions persist about the inherent physiology in these regions, and how it might differ in patients with HAND. In the current study, we use an advanced dynamic functional brain mapping approach to evaluate the role of two novel neurophysiological parameters, previously shown to be implicated in aging, in the pathophysiology of HAND.",THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT,10321801,R01MH116782,"['AIDS dementia', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Task Performances', 'Terminal Disease', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Visual Cortex', 'Western World', 'age related', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'electric field', 'healthy aging', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'somatosensory']",NIMH,FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' HOME,R01,2021,518570
"Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement Abstract The ~86 billion neurons that form the human brain are organized at multiple scales, ranging from the fine details of an individual neuron’s dendritic arborization, to local circuits that are embedded within large-scale systems spanning the brain. In this project, we will image across this vast range of scales to create a multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brain that can visualize hemisphere-wide networks and then zoom in to see individual, labeled cells at micron resolution in the frontal temporal lobe. This dramatic advance will be made possible through the use of an array of imaging technologies, including light-sheet microscopy (LSM), tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry (IMH), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and newly developed techniques in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as it provides micron resolution over large volumes of tissue, images all of the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and staining and hence can be automated, and is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior to cutting. LSM-based IMH will provide molecular, morphological and spatial properties of cells that will enable us to develop cellular classification systems, while OCT images of the same tissue will enable us to remove the distortions induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer information to whole-hemisphere MRI for atlasing and in vivo inference. This transfer of information depends critically on the ability to register images across a huge range of resolutions and contrast types. For this we propose to use the endogenous fiducial landmarks provided by the cerebral vasculature. To take full advantage of the vasculature using deep learning requires a training set of labeled vessels in each of our imaging modalities across an array of examples. The goal of this supplement is to provide these labelings including the assessment of intra- and inter-rater reliability. Relevance Automated segmentation of neurons, glia, cortical areas and laminar boundaries will enable new and more specific types of analyses of neuroimaging data. In particular, the ability to probe cellular and laminar properties of specific cortical areas may provide significant advances in developmental disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia. To facilitate these advances we propose to label cerebral vessels, then use the manual labeling to develop a deep learning-based technique to register images from microscopy to whole-hemisphere MRI.",Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement,10307352,U01MH117023,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Dyslexia', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Planet Earth', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuroimaging']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,99916
"Network and dendritic mechanisms of context-dependent cortical computation Many disorders including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease are being studied in-depth on the cellular and molecular level, and considerable progress has been made on how they change synaptic transmission and single neuron function. However, how cellular-level neuronal function translates to disruptions in larger-scale network function and cognition is not well understood. A key link between cellular function and behavior is the integration of synaptic inputs in the dendrites of neurons, which can give each individual neuron its own computational mechanisms that in turn shape the computations performed by networks of neurons. Efforts to study how sub-cellular dendritic function contributes to brain function and behavior, especially via the associative cortices involved in higher-level cognition, have been challenging, due to two major barriers. First, in rodents, the behaviors that engage associative cortices are incompatible with head fixation, limiting our ability to measure dendritic signals during complex behavior. Second, interpreting data from natural behaviors is computationally and conceptually hard: sensory encoding can be understood by averaging hundreds of trial repetitions, but studying decision-making in this manner makes animals memorize simple and stable stimulus-response associations, which do not require associative cortices in the same manner. This proposal will use new approaches that overcome these issues to examine the contributions of dendritic and network computation in a complex associative behavior. This project exploits a novel approach for cellular-level imaging in free behavior, and a task that requires animals to perform associative computations but is easy to train. The candidate has expertise in systems neuroscience, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and engineering, providing a strong foundation for this program. The K99 will provide training in dendritic physiology, and the computational methods required for linking complex tasks to the activity of individual neurons and networks of neurons despite variability in behavior. The primary mentor Dr. Mark Harnett will provide mentorship in dendritic function and methods for studying subcellular computation. The co- mentor Dr. Ila Fiete will provide training in computational methods relevant to the task. Additional advice from Dr. Mehrdad Jazayeri on modeling population dynamics and Dr. Cengiz Pehlevan on the mathematical properties of the underlying computations will ensure high-level training in all relevant scientific approaches. This training will enable the candidate to complete these aims and to develop an independent research program focused on neural computations underlying complex natural behaviors. The results of this research will provide new insight into how cellular computations contribute to complex behaviors, which will be important for understanding disorders with non-trivial behavioral phenotypes that are not easily studied in classical rodent behavior, such as dementia and schizophrenia. The brain is commonly thought of as a network of neurons, and each neuron is in-itself a network that performs complex functions such as learning to combine multiple inputs. These within-cell computations may play an important role in a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, dementia, autism, and epilepsy, but their role in complex and natural behaviors remains poorly understood. This project will apply new tools and computational approaches to understand how neurons coordinate during complex behaviors and establish the role of dendritic computations in these computations, providing novel insight into general mechanisms of associative cortical function.",Network and dendritic mechanisms of context-dependent cortical computation,10236349,K99NS118112,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Apical', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell behavior', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'expectation', 'free behavior', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual motor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,103324
"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.  At the end of Phase II, Translucence will have a market-ready Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic platform including reagent kits, user-friendly software, and service options. Project Narrative Translucence uses cutting-edge technology to make brains optically clear coupled with computational tools to map and quantify neuronal activity at single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain.

"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,10150484,R01MH120404,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical shape', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cortex mapping', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'neocortical', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'patch sequencing', 'preservation', 'scale up', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'ward']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,401250
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals Abstract Groundbreaking work within the NIH BRAIN Initiative has revealed many new types of neurons and their genetic signatures. The dividends from this research will include sophisticated tools allowing selective genetic access to these cell-types, such as for imaging, optogenetic or tracing studies. To complement these powerful genetic tools, it will be equally important to have new imaging techniques that can reveal how multiple neuron- types work together in the live brain to support information-processing and construct different brain states.  To address this challenge, Stanford University and The John B. Pierce Laboratory at Yale University will create optical techniques for imaging the concurrent voltage dynamics of up to 4 separate neuron-types in behaving animals. First, we will combine machine learning methods and an automated, high-throughput protein screening platform to engineer 4 different categories of genetically encoded fluorescent optical indicators of neuronal transmembrane voltage. We will then innovate several types of optical instruments tailored to work in conjunction with the new voltage indicators. These instruments will enable unprecedented studies of voltage rhythms and spiking dynamics in 2–4 genetically identified neuron-types in superficial and deep brain areas of awake behaving animals. One instrument will allow us to track the concurrent, population voltage oscillations of 2 neuron-types in freely behaving rodents. Another instrument, an optical mesoscope, will enable imaging studies of voltage waves and oscillations across the entire neocortical surface of behaving mice. A third device will be a high-speed miniature microscope for tracking neural dynamics at single cell-, single spike-resolution in freely behaving mice. Lastly, we will develop the capability to image with millisecond-scale precision the simultaneous spiking dynamics of 4 targeted neuron-types in either cortical or deep brain areas. Five external beta-tester labs will evaluate all these innovations in live mice and flies and provide critical user-feedback.  If our work succeeds, it will be a ‘game-changer’ for studies of brain dynamics, yielding vital knowledge about how different neuron-types synergize their dynamics to shape animal behavior and the brain’s global states in health and disease. To facilitate this outcome, we plan a 5-fold strategy for resource sharing: (i) All voltage-indicator constructs, viral vectors, transgenic flies, software and screening data will be deposited at public repositories for open distribution; (ii) All instrument designs will be published in extensive detail to facilitate replication; (iii) Our novel imaging devices will be integrated into an existing NIH-supported, publicly accessible facility for brain-imaging in rodents; (iv) In project years 2–4, we will conduct 4 training workshops for 40 visiting scientists per year (120 in total) to learn the new technologies firsthand. These visitors will also provide extensive user-feedback; (v) We will license our imaging instruments for commercial distribution.  Overall, we expect our project will lead to major conceptual advances in brain science and multiple new technologies that will reshape the practice of mammalian brain imaging. Project Narrative Prominent successes of the NIH BRAIN Initiative to date include the identification of many new types of neurons, but to understand how these cell-types work together in the live brain it will be crucial to have techniques that can record the coordinated voltage dynamics of multiple classes of identified neurons simultaneously. To create such techniques, we will engineer four novel fluorescent indicators of neuronal trans-membrane voltage and three new optical instruments tailored to use these indicators to image either the spiking or oscillatory voltage dynamics of up to four neuron-types concurrently in the brains of awake behaving animals. These innovations will reveal how multiple neuron-types act concertedly at the millisecond-scale to support information-processing and shape a wide range of neurophysiologic states.",Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals,10166236,U01NS120822,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Optical Instrument', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Visit', 'Work', 'absorption', 'awake', 'brain shape', 'cell type', 'design', 'fly', 'genetic signature', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'microendoscopy', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,875437
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10269928,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Wing', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'male', 'markov model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'peanut butter', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Neural population dynamics in premotor cortex during decision making Project Summary / Abstract Decision-making requires populations of neurons in the brain to collectively process sensory evidence and select appropriate behavioral responses. Neural population dynamics (NPDs), which describe how the responses of a population of individual neurons unfold over time, can provide an insightful view into these decision processes. Much is known about how individual neurons respond in select decision making tasks. However, little is known about how populations of neurons dynamically perform decision computations, and how resulting NPDs within a brain area are structured across many decision-making tasks. Shared features in NPDs across many tasks could indicate unifying neural mechanisms of computation that underlie the multi-functionality of a given neural circuit. This proposal aims to uncover the details and structure of these decision-related NPDs in human and nonhuman primate dorsal premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to both the function and dysfunction of decision making. Particular attention will be devoted to examining how NPDs are organized across multiple decision-making tasks and how those NPDs emerge during learning of new tasks. During the K99 phase, novel analytical tools will be developed for extracting NPDs from simultaneously recorded neural population activity and, importantly, for providing interpretable links between NPDs and their role in decision-related neural computation. With the goal of identifying unifying principles of decision-related computation, large-scale analyses will then integrate existing and newly collected neurophysiological datasets involving multiple decision-making tasks performed by humans and nonhuman primates. During the R00 phase, the proposed research will pivot toward understanding how NPDs emerge during learning to make new types of decisions. The proposal postulates that the ease, speed, and efficacy of learning all hinge on the extent by which critical neural circuits can leverage pre-existing neural mechanisms of computation. These concepts will be tested in collaborative human and nonhuman primate neu- rophysiological experiments, with guidance provided by interrogations of artificial neural networks posed with similar decision-related learning tasks. Upon completion, the proposed research will provide new fundamental knowledge concerning i) the multi-functional and adaptive role of premotor cortex across many decision-making tasks and ii) unifying principles of neural computation that support this flexibility. Better understanding decision- related circuits and their neural mechanisms could ultimately elucidate the basis for the numerous psychiatric disorders that impair decision making, which could eventually lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Our brain’s ability to generate decisions can be severely disrupted by psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. This proposal develops novel analytical and experimental approaches for understanding decision making at the level of populations of individual neurons in human and non-human primate premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to decision making. By integrating a large collection of new and existing datasets reflecting the involvement of premotor cortex in a wide range of decision- making tasks, the proposed research is expected to generate fundamental knowledge about unifying principles of decision-related neural computation, which may ultimately lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treat- ment of decision-impacting psychiatric conditions.",Neural population dynamics in premotor cortex during decision making,10412753,K99MH121533,"['Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,42222
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10415740,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,41175
"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders.

"CRCNS: US-French Research Proposal: Principles of Inference through Neural Dynamics    Recurrent interactions between neurons generate dynamic patterns of activity that serve as a substrate for behaviorally relevant computations. However, we do not yet have a principled framework for relating neural dynamics to neural computations. We have recently synthesized a theory that explains how low-rank recurrent neural networks may serve as a building block for computations. Our overarching goal is to integrate insights from this theory with behavior and electrophysiology in awake, behaving monkeys to establish a principled framework relating neural dynamics to neural computations. The project will start with reverse engineering low-rank network models that capture cortical dynamics in simple timing tasks. We then move systematically toward progressively higher rank network models that can perform timing tasks with progressively more sophisticated computational demands such as probabilistic inference of time intervals. We aim to create models that simultaneously succeed in performing task-relevant computations (i.e., behavior) and emulate cortical dynamics recorded in monkeys performing those tasks. We will use this iterative process to establish a principled framework relating neural dynamics to neural computations underlying inference. Finally, we will put this framework to test using a novel task that demands an unprecedented level of computational flexibility. RELEVANCE (See instructions): It has become increasingly apparent that the neurobiology of behavior in health and disease has to be probed at the level of populations of neurons.

"Circuits underlying threat and safety Classical conditioning has been studied in many different animal models, and even in humans. However, the larval zebrafish with its transparent brain offers a unique opportunity to observe large scale changes in synaptic structure that accompany this form of learning. Accordingly, we have developed a novel paradigm for visualizing synaptic changes that occur during classical conditioning in larval zebrafish. Using this paradigm we have observed striking region-specific changes in the distributions of synapses that drive the rewiring of neural circuits that mediate threat responses. In this grant we will expand this paradigm by monitoring neuronal activity through imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators throughout the pallium (the homolog of the amygdala) before, during and after classical conditioning and extinction. This will allow us to identify cells that comprise the circuits that control threat and safety and explore their connectivity using optogenetics. We will investigate how different sensory inputs can cause changes in the activity of those cells leading to synapse change, and the formation or extinction of associative memories. A crucial component of these studies will be the recording of field potentials to capture rhythmic activity throughout the pallium and high speed SPIM imaging of genetically encoded voltage indicators to record rhythms in individual cells. By understanding the precise timing of signals that impinge on individual cells we will uncover mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity. Our goal is to develop a theoretical model describing the neural circuits that underlie threat detection and how they can change as a result of associative memory formation and extinction. The research proposed in this grant is aimed at characterizing essential circuits in the larval zebrafish that control threat and safety. We will leverage the small size and transparency of the zebrafish brain in combination with state of the art imaging, genetically encoded probes, a custom software platform and biophysical modeling to study circuits at the cellular and molecular levels.",Circuits underlying threat and safety,10218722,U01NS122082,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Control Animal', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FAIR principles', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'physical state', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,4718512
"Coordinating structure and function for neuronal computations mediating context-dependent behavior Project Summary This proposal explores an emergent computational framework for understanding the neural population codes that support flexible, context-dependent behavior. The current state of the field is based on two competing views. According to the circuits view, fixed behaviors arise from specific anatomically or genetically defined cell populations that serve specific functions. Alternatively, the network computation view instead holds that neural activity provides mixed representations of task variables and can be understood only based on the joint activation of many neurons. Currently, these competing views are pursued by different communities with different tools, different behavioral paradigms and different model organisms. This has led to a disconnect between neural computation and the underlying biological circuit mechanisms. Here we propose a unified framework, in which the combinatorial activity of biologically-identified populations of neurons shapes the computations through low dimensional dynamics. A new interdisciplinary team of investigators - Pesaran (NYU - primate experimentalist), Johansen (RIKEN - rodent experimentalist) and Ostojic (Ecole Normale Superieure - computational theory) will develop the computational theory and apply it to flexible input-output tasks in multiple species - rats and non-human primates. To achieve these goals, we will analyze recurrent neural network models trained to perform a sensory-motor context-dependent decision-making task and fit low-dimensional models to experimental data. We will perform experiments in rodents and non-human primates to validate model predictions that combinatorial coding can support context-dependent behavior and is behaviorally-significant (Aim 1). We will analyze whether biologically-defined cell types map onto computationally-defined cell classes during context- dependent behavior by determining how activity in combinations of genetically and anatomically identified PFC cell types corresponds to low-dimensional dynamics (Aim 2). In parallel, we will determine how biologically- defined cell types control context-dependent behavior during explicitly-cued and implicitly-signaled contexts by performing optogenetic perturbations of anatomically-defined PFC cell types and testing behavioral performance (Aim 3). Successful completion of these aims will link neural computation to biology across multiple species to deliver a computational framework explaining how biological circuit mechanisms give rise to neuronal computations that mediate context-dependent behavior. Project Narrative How flexible context-dependent neural computations are implemented in the brain is critical to understanding the neural mechanisms of higher-cognitive functions. We propose to explore whether and how context-dependent flexible behavior is mediated by neural population codes involving multiple distinct populations in an integrated set of studies grounded in computational theory and models using recording and perturbation techniques in multiple species. Successful completion of these aims will link neural computation to biology across multiple species to deliver a computational framework explaining how biological circuit mechanisms give rise to neuronal computations that mediate context-dependent behavior.",Coordinating structure and function for neuronal computations mediating context-dependent behavior,10225166,U01NS122123,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Goals', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Taxes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'combinatorial', 'computational network modeling', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,2824391
"Using perceptual decision-making to understand the role of selective inhibitory activity in cortical computation Cortical circuits perform computations to generate appropriate behaviors based upon diverse sensory inputs. These computations are central to an animal maintaining its health and long- term survival. An example of this type of computation are perceptual decision-making tasks where an animal must weigh sensory evidence to choose a behavior which will elicit a reward. The classical circuit models of decision-making focus solely on the effects of recurrent excitation, treating inhibitory neurons as agnostic facilitators of competition between excitatory subpopulations. However, this view of inhibitory neurons is at odds with experiment results which show a diversity of interneuron tuning and connectivity across the cortex, recently in the decision-making context. I propose to develop new models of cortical decision-making circuits which parameterizes selectivity of connections between subpopulations within the excitatory and inhibitory populations to understand how selectivity shapes the attractor dynamics underlying decision-making and how these dynamics represent animal choice. Based on the analysis of these models, I will establish an updated theoretical framework for the neural circuit mechanisms of decision-making behaviors which more fully account the intricacies of cortical circuit structure and more fully represent the diversity of neuronal cell-types. The role of inhibitory selectivity in facilitating task learning will be investigated using artificial neural networks as a proxy. Finally, single cell resolution calcium activity will be measured from a labeled inhibitory cell-type. This work will address how circuit structure and cell-type shape population dynamics underlying decision-making and how local cortical processes generate meaningful behaviors. Complex cognitive processes such as perceptual decision-making arise through computations performed in cortical circuits. Models describing these computations often treat inhibitory neurons as agnostic facilitators of competition between excitatory populations. Using theoretical and single neuron resolution imaging of cortical population activity, this project aims to more fully account for the role of interneurons in cortical computation.",Using perceptual decision-making to understand the role of selective inhibitory activity in cortical computation,10164614,F32MH123011,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'two-photon']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2021,71390
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic.

"Astrocyte Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior Project Summary: Overall “What is the function of glial cells in neural centers? The answer is still not known, and it may remain unsolved for many years to come until scientists find direct methods to attack it.” (Ramon y Cajal, 1901). This prophecy turned out to be accurate. Astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types in the brain, have long been thought of as primarily passive support cells. Over the past two decades, studies indicate that astrocytes play pivotal roles in nervous system development, function, and diseases. However, a major unresolved issue in neuroscience is how astrocytes integrate diverse neuronal signals under healthy conditions, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and how aberrant excitation and molecular output influences sensorimotor behavior and contributes to disease. The overall goal of this U19 Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Program proposal is to address this fundamental issue by developing a deeper mechanistic understanding of astrocytes’ roles in neural circuit operation, complex behaviors, and brain computation theories. Two overarching questions will be addressed: 1) How do astrocytes temporally and spatially integrate molecular signals from the diverse types of local and projection neurons activated during sensorimotor behaviors. 2) How do astrocytes convert this information into functional outputs that modulate neural circuit structure and function at different spatial and temporal scales. A multidisciplinary, comprehensive effort is proposed to address these questions that can only be completed through close collaboration between researchers with unique and complementary expertise. An innovative multi-scale approach integrating functional, anatomical, and genetic analyses with theoretical modeling will be leveraged. This approach involves quantitative behavioral assays, large-scale imaging of cellular and molecular dynamics, targeted cell-type-specific manipulations, high- throughput omic techniques, genetic profiling, protein engineering, machine learning, and computational modeling. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms will be determined through which astrocytes influence neural circuits and contribute to complex behaviors and brain computation theories. The experimental and data analysis tools developed as part of this project will be invaluable for the broader neuroscience community. Project Narrative: Overall The human brain contains roughly equal numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. A major unresolved issue in understanding brain function is how the non-neuronal cells integrate neuronal molecular signals, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and mediate changes in information processing, perception, and behavior. This project will employ a broad range of experimental and theoretical approaches to identify core principles of the bi-directional communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells in various brain regions and how disrupting this regular communication transforms perception and action in health and disease.",Astrocyte Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior,10294800,U19NS123719,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Protein Engineering', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'gene therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo imaging', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learned behavior', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system development', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'synaptic function', 'theories', 'tool', 'tool development']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,U19,2021,2100000
"Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum The architecture of brain circuits plays an essential role in understanding their function. The discovery of principal concepts in physiology and neurocomputation critically depends on the availability of precise morphological knowledge. A prominent example supporting this notion is the cerebellum, a brain circuit that is involved in motor (and non-motor) control and adaptation. At the center of cerebellar circuits are Purkinje cells, projection neurons that receive thousands of excitatory synapses, which convey sensory information needed for proper motor control. A hallmark feature of these unique neurons is that they have a massive dendrite that is innervated, in the adult brain, by one climbing fiber input. The climbing fiber plays a crucial role in theories of cerebellar supervised learning, and within this conceptual framework provides an instructive signal (here an error signal) guiding plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. More recent studies have, in addition, pointed out roles in reward signaling and noted that climbing fiber-evoked complex spikes occur in response to a variety of sensory stimuli and may also carry motor command signals. These activity-dependent complex spikes are observed in addition to spontaneous complex spikes that occur at an average frequency of about 1Hz. Thus, while we do not know what the exact functions of climbing fiber signaling are, it is obvious that this unusual input provides a core element of cerebellar cortical circuits and to some degree will define its operations. Our discovery – presented here as pilot data – that a subgroup of the entire adult Purkinje cell population (~15%) has two climbing fiber inputs instead of just one, that two inputs are almost exclusively observed in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites (either separately exiting from the soma, or separating in close proximity to it) and that within this subgroup 20-25% of Purkinje cells show two climbing fiber inputs, leads to the question whether there is a functional significance of this double innervation. Is persistent double climbing fiber innervation of adult Purkinje cells a bug or a feature? In this exploratory study, we plan to examine the basic phenomenon further and to assess whether two separate climbing fiber inputs may signal independently. If the answer to our ‘bug or feature’ question is ‘feature’, we will examine consequences for cerebellar function (e.g. behavioral learning tests) in subsequent studies that we will seek separate funding for. The first aim uses patch-clamp recordings from mice in combination with confocal microscopy in vitro to test the hypothesis that the persistence of multiple climbing fibers is not random, but occurs in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites. We will also inject tracer dyes into the inferior olive to stain climbing fibers and anatomically confirm the existence of two climbing fiber inputs. The second aim will add calcium imaging in vitro to examine whether a double climbing fiber input leads to functionally separate, dendritic calcium signaling domains. The third aim uses GCaMP6f-based two-photon imaging from Purkinje cells in awake mice to assess whether under spontaneous conditions, or with sensory stimulation, two climbing fiber inputs may operate independently. The microarchitecture of the cerebellum is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, with the innervation of adult Purkinje cells by a single climbing fiber input as one of its signature characteristics. Pilot studies from our laboratory show that, in contrast to this assumed connectivity pattern, a sizeable subgroup of Purkinje cells with specific dendrite characteristics is innervated by two climbing fiber inputs, thus challenging the traditional view that one dendrite-wide instructive signal, provided by one climbing fiber input, guides the cerebellar control of motor and cognitive functions. Using patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices as well as two-photon recordings from awake mice, we plan to investigate consequences of double innervation, in particular the question whether two climbing fiber inputs may signal independently.",Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum,10315621,R21NS124217,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Dyes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Flowcharts', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Olives - dietary', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Visual', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'in vivo', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nerve supply', 'neuronal cell body', 'operation', 'patch clamp', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2021,451000
"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Large-scale monitoring of circuits for adaptation and novelty detection in primary visual cortex Project Summary/Abstract  In a world filled with sensory information, the ability to filter out repetitive or redundant stimuli while still maintaining the ability to detect change in the environment is critical to biological success. Studies have characterized reduced cortical responses to repetitive stimuli (adaptation) and augmented cortical responses to stimuli that differ from these expected regularities (novelty detection); however, the cortical circuits that enable flexibly encoding stimuli based on the context in which they are experienced remain unknown. Disinhibitory microcircuits, especially those mediated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing inhibitory interneurons (VIPs), may play a role in this flexible coding by altering the inhibition supplied to principal excitatory neurons (PYRs) in neocortex. Despite this, the relationship between neural activity of VIPs and PYRs during adaptation and novelty detection remain poorly understood.  In this proposal, I seek to use fast dual-color, three-dimensional, two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neural activity of both VIPs and PYRs in primary visual cortex during a classic visual “oddball” paradigm (Aim 1). This paradigm presents the same stimulus in control, repetitive, and rare/deviant contexts, which enables directly recording neural responses to the same stimulus when it is an established regularity and when it is novel and thus deviates from established regularity. I will then use data and theory analysis tools to computationally model neocortical adaptation and novelty detection (Aim 2) by incorporating anatomical and neural recording data from PYRs and interneuron populations (including VIPs), which are often excluded from network models. The creation of this holistic model is likely to reveal fundamental circuitry that gives rise to flexible neural encoding of sensory stimuli. Finally, I will integrate optogenetic interventional tools for circuit manipulation with two-photon imaging to directly test the relationship between VIP neural activity and adaptation and novelty detection in PYRs. Altogether, these aims directly address several of the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goals: monitor neural activity, interventional tools, data and theory analysis, and integrated approaches. Furthermore, the experiments proposed under these aims will result in significant technical and theoretical training for the applicant and will advance essential understanding of how excitatory, inhibitory, and disinhibitory circuits across cortical layers diverge in their dynamic neural activity and differentially contribute to sensory processing. Project Narrative (3 sentences) The ability to filter repetitive sensory stimulation from conscious perception while remaining able to respond to changes in the environment is quintessential to successfully relating to the world in which one lives; however, the basic neural circuitry that enables this flexible encoding of sensory stimuli is poorly understood. Here we integrate state-of-the-art neurotechnologies to complete large-scale monitoring of neural activity with interventional tools to directly test relationships between genetically defined populations of cortical neurons and then incorporate them into a working computational neural network model. The model developed in this proposal will be distributed to the wider neuroscientific community and the results of the proposed aims will provide significant insight into context-dependent modulation of neural activity that is integral to normal nervous system function and is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric disease.",Large-scale monitoring of circuits for adaptation and novelty detection in primary visual cortex,10300007,F32MH125445,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Cortical Column', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'area striata', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'behavior test', 'career', 'cell type', 'deviant', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'lens', 'neocortical', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory mechanism', 'sensory stimulus', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,71390
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10261540,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,337222
"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies.

"Identification and characterization of chromatin regulators of coordinated synaptic gene expression Project Summary/Abstract Nervous system function requires the integration of diverse neuronal subtypes into neural circuits that elicit thought and behavior. Despite the extensive diversity of neuronal subtypes, all neurons share key features, including chemical synapses. Current models indicate that shared neuronal genes, including pan-synaptic genes, are independently regulated by different combinations of transcription factors in distinct neuronal subtypes, whereas subtype-specific synaptic genes are regulated by specific transcription factors called terminal selectors. Our data demonstrate that pan-neuronal and subtype-specific synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis. We have identified a candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) that includes two known pioneer factors, and propose a model in which positive and negative regulation of chromatin accessibility underlie the coordinated regulation of synaptic gene expression to promote synapse formation. In Aim 1, we propose genomic and in vivo functional validation to test the model that two of our candidate transcription factors, GA-rich motif binding factors CLAMP and GAGA factor, bind to the same promoters of synaptic genes to exert opposite effects on chromatin accessibility and transcription. In Aim 2, we propose a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identifying the GRNs underlying coordinated synaptic gene expression through single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-Seq. Successful completion of these studies will advance our understanding of how the development of shared neuronal traits is coordinated with cell fate acquisition, and may inform neuronal reprogramming of stem cells. Project Narrative The nervous system is remarkable for its cellular diversity and functional complexity, yet despite extensive diversity, all neurons share key features such as chemical synapses. While pan- neuronal and sub-type specific genes are thought to be regulated through distinct mechanisms, our data demonstrate that these classes of synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis. Here, we propose genomic and in vivo functional studies to test the model that positive and negative regulators of chromatin accessibility temporally coordinate synaptic gene expression to promote synapse formation.",Identification and characterization of chromatin regulators of coordinated synaptic gene expression,10391155,R21NS125864,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Letters', 'Logic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual system structure', 'cofactor', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'promoter', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cells', 'synaptogenesis', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,429309
"CRCNS: Multiple clocks for the encoding of time in corticostriatal circuits The ability to predict when external events will occur, such as anticipating the actions of a predator or the  availability of food, is critical for survival. Converging computational and experimental work suggests that  dynamically changing patterns of neural activity, including neural sequences, underlie temporal prediction  and temporal processing. It is increasingly clear that timing and temporal prediction are highly distributed  computations, however, there has been little effort to systematically contrast and understand the  computational tradeoffs between how time is encoded in different brain areas. Furthermore, while  converging evidence suggests neural sequences in the striatum play a central role in timing, the  mechanisms underlying the generation of neural sequences remains elusive. Critically, it is not known  whether neural sequences are actively generated within the striatum or are “driven” by neural sequences  present in corticostriatal inputs. We propose to address these major gaps in understanding with a  combination of innovative experimental and computational approaches. Our key hypotheses are that: 1)  neural sequences in the striatum provide a flexible dynamical regime that allows for temporal scaling, i.e.,  speeding-up or slowing-down of motor responses, 2) cortical input shapes neural sequence formation in  the striatum, 3) local inhibitory circuits serve to refine the quality of these sequences in the striatum, and  4) neural dynamics encoding time are widely distributed throughout the brain but are more accurate in  certain areas such as the striatum. Our project is anchored in a two-interval timing task in which mice  learn to associate two cues with different reward delays, and has three major aims. Guided by large-scale  neural recordings in multiple brain areas we will first develop cortical and striatal recurrent neural network  models with the goal of understanding which circuit motifs are best suited to generate neural sequences,  and determining which models best capture the experimentally observed activity patterns. Second, we will  integrate neural recordings and optogenetic perturbations, together with computational approaches, to  determine whether neural sequences in the striatum are driven by cortical input and refined by local  inhibition, or in contrast actively generated within the striatum. Third, we will carry out a high-throughput  electrophysiological survey of neural activity in multiple brain areas, to identify which areas contain the  most accurate temporal codes as well as the potential computational tradeoffs between different codes. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  By integrating advanced computational and experimental approaches, this collaborative project will  provide fundamentally new insights about how the mammalian brain is able to predict when external  events will occur, enabling animals to produce appropriately timed movements that are critical in daily life.  This work will reveal which brain circuits are most strongly implicated in timing, which is often impaired in  neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease. n/a",CRCNS: Multiple clocks for the encoding of time in corticostriatal circuits,10396146,R01NS125877,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Medial', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'data modeling', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural patterning', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,376848
"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species.

"Neural dynamics and substrates of graphical knowledge Project Summary/Abstract The ability to use explicitly structured internal models of the world is both central to biological intelligence and impaired in disorders of cognition (e.g. dementia and schizophrenia). Recent work indicates that cognitive abilities such as declarative memory and navigation rely on internal models having the structure of graphs, i.e. composed of rules and variables. Such graphical knowledge structures, or ‘schemas,’ are now thought to be what enable humans and animals alike to make extraordinary and systematic inferences, to generalize, to learn in single trials, and to imagine: thus schemas are understood to be basis of advanced cognition. Still, despite this vital importance, little is known about how neurons in the brain implement schemas. Solving this overarching problem is my scientific goal, and the aim of the present proposal. In recent work, I have discovered a collection of recurrent neural networks (RNN) – neural systems that are plausibly implemented in the brain – that can perform three cognitive tasks requiring schemas: transitive inference (TI), associative inference (AI), and identity rule inference (IRI). Importantly, these tasks are potentially more tractable alternatives to traditional schematic tasks in neuroscience: indeed, initial analyses indicate that RNNs use a solvable set of dynamical mechanisms to implement schemas, and are thus mechanistic hypotheses that have not previously existed in neuroscience. Given these findings, I hypothesize that these candidate mechanisms are used in hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), two brain regions required for schemas. To test this guiding hypothesis, I will solve and characterize the mechanisms accomplishing AI and TI (Aim 1) and IRI (Aim 2) in RNNs (K99), then probe mechanisms experimentally via high-density recordings in the HPC and PFC of rats performing these tasks in an innovative olfactory-based paradigm (Aim 3) (R00). Achieving these Aims has the potential to establish how schemas are implemented in the brain, and therefore can clarify the neural basis of advanced cognition; this work can also clarify computational and behavioral roles of HPC and PFC, two brain structures essential to cognition. The K99 phase of this work will be done in the Zuckerman Institute for Brain and Behavior at Columbia University under the mentorship of Larry Abbott and John Cunningham, two leading authorities who will advise on neural modelling, dynamical systems, and advanced machine learning; in addition, collaborators (Drs. Stefano Fusi, Vincent Ferrera, Daphna Shohamy, Rui Costa, and Richard Axel) will contribute scientific and technical expertise on cognitive tasks (design and neurobiological interpretation) and neural recordings. The training environment also includes the wider innovative and collaborative neuroscience community at Columbia, the Columbia Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and their associated scientific and career development opportunities. Training in the K99 phase will be crucial for both the proposed research and for establishing future scientific and professional independence as an investigator leading a research group. Project Narrative Our cognitive abilities define us, and disorders involving cognitive impairment (including dementia, schizophrenia, and autism) are both debilitating and widespread. Recent scientific advances indicate that many of our most vital cognitive abilities (including memory, reasoning, planning, and creativity) rely on a form of knowledge that has the structure of graphs – yet despite this insight, we still do not know how graphical knowledge is implemented by neurons in the brain.

"Long-range neuronal projections: circuit blueprint or stochastic targeting?  Rigorous classification of brain-wide axonal reconstructions ABSTRACT (PROJECT SUMMARY) The classification of neurons in the mammalian brain has long been a focus of intensive investigation in neuroscience. Neurons are widely recognized as the fundamental computational elements of the nervous system, and the broad diversity of their morphological, physiological, and molecular properties may provide crucial insights into their function and involvement in disease. Long-range axonal projections, in particular, are the quintessential determinants of network connectivity, providing a key nexus between cellular organization and circuit architecture. Converging technological breakthroughs in microscopic imaging, genetic labeling, and algorithmic development have only recently enabled the high-throughput collection of large-scale, whole-brain axonal reconstructions under the BRAIN initiative. Using a principled statistical strategy, the proposed project leverages such information-rich resources to rigorously identify, from each brain region, all “projection neuron types” with objectively distinct patterns of anatomical targeting. This application will thus directly test the seminal hypothesis that the axonal trajectories of individual neurons follow specific coordination plans as opposed to aiming randomly within the constraints of regional connections. While this data-driven classification necessarily depends on the existing digital tracings, we will deploy our full analysis workflow as an automated pipeline on public cloud servers, allowing not only free community access, but also continuous refinement of the resulting knowledge as more datasets become available. Moreover, our approach allows the quantitative estimation of the population size of every separate neuron class as well as its unique distribution of path distances from the soma to each target, defining the basic temporal dynamics of information transmission. We will also determine if different projection neuron types vary in their dendritic morphology, providing an important clue as to whether input processing is specifically tuned for the intended outputs. Furthermore, we will extend this innovative methodology by applying it to complementary datasets obtained by stochastic nucleic acid barcoding, laser capture microdissection, and sequencing, yielding far greater sample sizes in exchange for lower anatomical resolution. Last but not least, we will model the discovered axonal projection patterns into a novel artificial neural network design (“projectron nets”) to systematically explore their possible selective advantages in learning and memory robustness and performance. Achieving these goals will thus quantify, for the first time, the relevant single-neuron motifs to outline the functional blueprint of the mammalian central nervous system and related impairments for the long-lasting benefit of public health. Long-range neuronal projections: circuit blueprint or stochastic targeting?  Rigorous classification of brain-wide axonal reconstructions The long-range axonal projections of individual nerve cells underlie brain connectivity and cognitive operations, and are altered in many pathological conditions including schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders increasingly recognized as “connectopathies”. Despite recent technological breakthroughs allowing the continuous accumulation of substantial amounts of whole-brain, single-neuron reconstructions, we still do not know whether these anatomical patterns constitute highly specific circuit motifs or simply reflect random variation within the known constraints of regional connections.

"Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human Project Summary The proposed work will address a critical gap in our understanding of neuronal phenotypes and cell types by developing machine learning algorithms and cloud-based software for the integration of multiple modality characterizations large and growing datasets of cortical neurons in mouse and human. Through optimal and innovative use of potentially incomplete data and emphasis on automated morphological characterization, the proposed tools will enable richer and consistent characterizations of neurons from transcriptomic, anatomical, or electrophysiological profiling. While large-scale, BICCN-funded cell type research programs rely on the notion of unique neuronal identity which determines the cell’s phenotype across different observation modalities, overarching agreements across physiological, anatomical and molecular characterizations remain elusive. Although these large-scale programs succeeded in generating extensive multiple modality datasets, the lack of principled, accurate and widely available computational alignment and inference tools presents a roadblock to the success of the overall program. A second issue is that anatomical characterization, despite being the classical approach to understanding cell types, lags significantly behind molecular and physiological methods in terms of throughput. The research proposed here aims to address the alignment problem by building on the coupled autoencoder approach, which presents an efficient optimization framework centered on the ubiquity of neuronal identity. Importantly, the proposed software can utilize incompletely characterized data points, which is common in practice, to produce unified visualization and analysis of abstract neuronal identity. This tool will be both flexible (e.g., the feature set can be changed) and extensible (e.g., more observation modalities can be added for joint alignment). The aligned representations enable consistent clustering of the neuronal population across the different observation modalities, which is a pressing problem in modern neuroscience. We propose to address the anatomical throughput issue with an end-to-end computational pipeline, from the raw image of local neuronal arbors to the anatomical descriptor that can be readily aligned and interpreted by the coupled autoencoder software. By utilizing our extensive gold-standard manual reconstructions, we will train supervised deep artificial neural networks to segment neuronal arbors in sparse labeling scenarios. The rich set of training examples, together with algorithmic innovations, will endow superior generalizability of this automated segmentation tool, accelerating science for light microscopy-based studies. Project Narrative The prospect of addressing many questions on the function and dysfunction of the nervous system hinges on the ability to consistently identify the same cell type label for a given cell, independent of the observation modality. While much recent progress has been achieved by jointly characterizing neurons with multiple observation modalities, a lack of software tools that can consistently infer the type and unobserved features of incompletely characterized neurons hinders progress. This work will analyze large and growing single neuron datasets to develop accessible computational methods for relating and harmonizing anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular data.",Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human,10365216,RF1MH128778,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brightfield Microscopy', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'automated analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data repository', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'neural network', 'patch sequencing', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1081350
"Comprehensive and multi-resolution mapping of cell morphology and wiring through X-ray holographic nano-tomography Project Summary / Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is understanding how information is processed in neuronal circuits. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is dependent on how it is connected, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How do we approach such a complex computational system? Recent advances in X-ray microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and connectivity. The cerebellum is an excellent system to scale and validate a new platform to systematically reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently studied to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and their connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to scale and validate our next-generation X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently established in our labs to disentangle a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit and cell type organization, and may help us determine the role of specific cell types in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles of cell types in the cerebellum. We will develop and scale X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) to extract the anatomy and connectivity of cerebellar cell types. Understanding rules underlying cell type-specific neuronal connectivity may help to reveal how the brain is altered in neurodegenerative disorders, specific cell types that are affected, and guide effective treatment strategies.",Comprehensive and multi-resolution mapping of cell morphology and wiring through X-ray holographic nano-tomography,10376584,RF1MH128949,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Social Behavior', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'Synapses', 'Synchrotrons', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'X ray microscopy', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'motor control', 'nano', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'stability testing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2021,1889320
"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
