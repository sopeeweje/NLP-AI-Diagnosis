"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10190939,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,611185
"Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life Abstract This proposal requests continued funding support for research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop computational tools for quantifying longitudinal structural changes in the human brain. The previous project period has been extremely successful in advancing robust tools for longitudinal brain analysis of the aging brain. In this renewal, we seek to further advance robust computational tools for comprehensive longitudinal characterization of changes in the early developing brain. This is in line with our long-term goal of creating computational tools for longitudinal charting of brain evolution across the entire human lifespan. The tools to be developed in this project will allow uniﬁed and concurrent analysis of longitudinal volumetric data and cortical surfaces, facilitating the mapping of dynamic and spatially heterogeneous structural changes during a critical period of brain development. The tools developed in this project will be tailored to studying the human brain in the ﬁrst few years of life, which undergoes dynamic development in both structure and function. We will utilize the MRI data made available via the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), involving 500 pediatric subjects scanned from birth to ﬁve years of age. The outcome of BCP will inform neuroscientists what normal healthy growth looks like and facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of brain disorders. To fully beneﬁt from this unique dataset, dedicated computational tools are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heteroge- neous changes across time. However, most computational tools developed to date have been mostly focused on adult subjects and are unreliable when applied to baby MRI. We propose to address this gap with three aims: In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools to allow multifaceted analysis of MRI data, including volumes and white-matter/pial surfaces, to be carried out in common spaces for a more holistic understanding of the early developing brain. Our tools will explicitly consider the rapid changes in MR image appearances that are typical in the ﬁrst year of life. Unlike conventional methods that are designed for either image volumes or cortical surfaces, resulting in inconsistencies and loss of sensitivity to subtle changes, our tools will allow joint volume-surface analysis in consistent longitudinal spaces. Improving registration accuracy by drawing information from both entities is critical for detecting subtle changes in the developing brain, which is signiﬁcantly smaller with a thinner cerebral cortex. In Aim 2, we will generate longitudinal, multimodal, and whole-brain parcellation maps for the early developing brain. Subdivision of the brain into coherent regions is an essential step in the macroscopic mapping of spa- tially heterogeneous changes and in the examination of spatial and topological organization. Our approach will allow the characterization of the evolution of parcellation across time and at the same time maintain temporal consistency and inter-subject correspondences of the parcels. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow prediction of missing MRI data to increase the usability of incomplete data for improving statistical power. Missing data is a common and inevitable problem in longitudinal studies due to subject dropouts or failed scans, especially in studies involving infants. To address this problem, we will develop deep learning techniques for longitudinal prediction of missing imaging data. Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools for more precise charting of the normative early development of the human brain using MRI. As part of this project, we will deliver the ﬁrst set of temporally-dense surface-volumetric atlases that will capture key developmental traits and are therefore critical for quantiﬁcation of possible deviation from normal brain development. Project Narrative Unlike the vast majority of computational tools that are developed for adult brain MRI with good image con- trast, this project will empower neuroscience researchers with robust tools needed to quantify temporal structural changes in the early developing brain, including tools for (i) Uniﬁed longitudinal analysis of volumetric and surface data of infant MRI; (ii) Multimodal parcellation with longitudinal and intersubject consistency; (iii) Deep learning prediction of missing data. The tools developed will be disseminated in the form of a software package complete with documentation and tutorials. As part of this project, we will deliver the ﬁrst set of temporally-dense surface- volumetric atlases that will capture key developmental traits, critical for quantiﬁcation of possible deviation from normal brain development.",Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life,10234769,R01EB008374,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Dropout', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'aging brain', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'contrast imaging', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'design', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'multimodality', 'predictive tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'usability', 'white matter']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,508715
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",10139101,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data complexity', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,341300
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. n/a",SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women,10217258,R01LM013327,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New York', 'Nulliparity', 'Paper', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Premature Birth', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Impacts', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness testing', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'minority student', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'non-genetic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'undergraduate research']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,246970
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language Project Summary/Abstract Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life. Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis, and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. This project pertains to three neuroimaging datasets — two functional MRI and one from stroke survivors — that speak to the neural basis of concepts and language processing in the brain. We aim to transform these data and associated metadata to a “machine learning ready” format and make them easily accessible. This will enable application of powerful modern machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, for their analysis. We expect that these analyses will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and impaired brain. Project Narrative Understanding how conceptual information is organized, represented in the brain, and affected by neuropathology is a major focus of research, as it has direct relevance to many neurological disorders.

"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation. SCAN will establish an intellectual home for dissemination of cutting-edge research in human cognitive auditory neuroscience, support the development of the next generation of scientists, build a vibrant and inclusive community that engages with the grand challenges in the field, and forge new academia-industry partnerships.",SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN),10078266,R13DC018243,"['Academia', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Atmosphere', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Home', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Joint Ventures', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Otolaryngology', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'deafness', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open data', 'posters', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'symposium', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,1766
"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation,10145798,K99NR019124,"['Ablation', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Devices', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enabling Factors', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Reading', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'data visualization', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health related quality of life', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'shared decision making', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment risk', 'user centered design']",NINR,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,87632
"Elucidating symptoms clusters in multiple sclerosis using patient reported outcomes and unsupervised machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting 900,000 persons in the U.S, and it is a leading cause of disability among young adults. Persons with MS (PwMS) experience wide-ranging symptoms across multiple domains, alone or in combination, with varied severity. Some of these symptoms include optic nerve dysfunction and vision problems, muscle weakness, bladder/bowel dysfunction, tremors, cognitive and emotional problems, and incoordination. The objectives of the current application are to identify and characterize symptom patterns and clusters in PwMS, which are aligned with PA-17-462, that states: “multiple sclerosis (is a) … model condition to advance (symptom) cluster research”. Thus, our analytical framework will inform research in other poly-symptomatic conditions.  Stakeholders agree that the benefits of patient reported outcomes (PROs) and measures (PROMs) have not reached their full potential for PwMS. PROs, which provide invaluable insight into the patients’ perspective, are increasingly used in MS clinical trials and clinical practice as standard clinical measures fail to adequately measure impairment across domains or lack sensitivity to detect subtle but meaningful change. Aligning with ongoing global MS initiatives, the current proposal will focus on identifying and characterizing symptom patterns and clusters for PROs; which is also directly aligned with NOT-OD-20-079, a Notice of Special Interest to stimulate “research to improve the interpretation of PROs at the individual patient level for use in the clinical practice”. Furthermore, there is an additional incentive to maximize the use and interpretation of PROs considering the shift to telemedicine service in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of research scientists and clinical experts with access to two unparalleled data resources (discovery and validation data sets), the 1st being the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry’s survey data for 21,558 PwMS spanning an average of 8.4 years (0.5 to 14 years) and 269,468 biannual surveys, and the 2nd being the structured electronic health records (EHRs) for 8,687 PwMS see at the Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research (MCMS) at the Cleveland Clinic, spanning an average of 4 years (0.5-8.4 years) and 67,932 visits. In both resources, 11 MS-specific PROMs (MS-PROMs) were longitudinally captured including measures of mobility, dexterity, vision, fatigue, cognition, bladder/bowel, sensory, spasticity, depression, tremor/coordination, and pain. We propose the four complementary aims that will: 1. Characterize overall longitudinal impairment patterns for each 11 MS-PROMs; 2. Identify distinct clusters of Pw MS with similar symptom patterns within and across functional domains using machine learning approaches; 3. Develop new approaches to assess the strength of causal inference and identify sources of model prediction errors in unsupervised machine learning; and 4. Create a dynamic simulation dashboard for predicting MS phenotypes based on the findings of aims 1-3.  With these aims, we seek to advance MS phenotyping to facilitate improvements in research, clinical care, and approaches to self-management. By focusing on PROMs, we will leverage the experience of PwMS which is independent of their location (i.e. applications to rural residents) and ideal for telemedicine. We hope that our findings will advance care and empower PwMS to engage in health decisions where personalized phenotypic characterization is necessary. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are 900,000 Americans living with multiple sclerosis (MS), who experience wide-ranging symptoms across multiple domains, alone or in combination, with varied severity. Key barriers to clinical management and future research include the absence of 1) knowledge regarding patterns in MS symptom development, and 2) knowledge of specific patient clusters who share similar symptom patterns and as a result may differentially respond to various interventions. In this project, we will use data analytic and machine learning techniques to characterize and identify symptom patterns/clusters within and across functional domains using MS-specific patient reported outcome measures, and build an adjunctive predictive dashboard informed by these findings that can assist clinicians and patients in disease management.",Elucidating symptoms clusters in multiple sclerosis using patient reported outcomes and unsupervised machine learning,10440701,R56NR019306,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Bladder', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rural Community', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tremor', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data resource', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'response', 'rural dwellers', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'sociodemographics', 'software development', 'spasticity', 'symptom cluster', 'teleneurology', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment research', 'unsupervised learning', 'young adult']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,156251
"Symptom Cluster of Midlife Menopausal Women with Metabolic Syndrome ABSTRACT Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that includes hypertension, central obesity, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. It has been associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction. It is estimated that more than one third of the U.S. population meets criteria for MS. Specifically, its prevalence is higher in women than in men with currently 2 million more women being affected in the United States. Individuals with MS experience multiple symptoms such as pain, sleep disturbance, and altered mood that affect patient outcomes. While research often focuses on single symptoms. it is rare that an individual with a chronic condition presents with a single symptom but rather experiences multiple symptoms or symptom clusters. However, little is known about symptom clusters in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the complex symptom experience of midlife menopausal women with MS. This study aims to: 1) identify symptom clusters in midlife menopausal women with MS and key symptom(s) that exert influence on symptom clusters, 2) explore symptom experience trajectory over time to classify midlife menopausal women with MS with distinct symptom experience and identify subgroup at high-risk for greater symptom burden over time using symptom clusters, and 3) examine individual characteristics associated with each symptom cluster subgroup membership. This retrospective, descriptive longitudinal study will use existing data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) from Baseline to Visit 10. Machine learning based network analysis (NA) will be used to identify symptom clusters and key symptoms that exert influence within and among symptom clusters. Growth Mixture Model (GMM) will be used to classify midlife menopausal women with MS with distinct symptom experience and identify subgroup at high-risk for greater symptom burden. Regression model will be used to examine individual characteristics associated with each symptom cluster subgroup membership. The proposed study is in response to National Institute of Nursing Research Strategic Plan in Symptom Science. It will assist in providing quantitative visualization and interpretation of the relationships among symptoms and symptom clusters and identifying key symptom(s) through machine learning based network analysis that may serve as a potential target for future interventions. It will also identify subgroups at high risk for greater symptom burden and their associated individual characteristics that will inform future development of targeted symptom interventions for different risk groups. Findings from this study will inform the next stage of symptom science research through application of new analytic techniques and clinical application to manage symptom clusters and key symptoms in midlife menopausal women with MS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Metabolic syndrome is a global public health problem and is prevalent in midlife menopausal women. This study seeks to understand the complex symptom experience of midlife menopausal women with metabolic syndrome. Findings from this study will help inform development of targeted symptom management interventions to improve patient outcomes and have the strong potential to inform symptom science in other chronic disease conditions.",Symptom Cluster of Midlife Menopausal Women with Metabolic Syndrome,10228373,F31NR019921,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Central obesity', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Menopausal Status', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Study of Women&apos', 's Health Across the Nation', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'biopsychosocial factor', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'men', 'middle age', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'time use']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Varieties of Impulsivity in Opiate and Stimulant Users Project Summary Impulsivity has gained prominence as one of the cardinal etiological risk factors for the development and maintenance of addictive disorders. However, both impulsivity and addiction are highly heterogeneous, which has hampered progress in understanding the link between the two. To address this heterogeneity, we have developed a program of addiction research in Bulgaria, a major European center for production of synthetic amphetamine-type stimulants and a key transit country for heroin trafficking, due to its strategic geographical position on the Balkan Drug Route. Through our 17-yearlong collaboration with Bulgarian colleagues, we have accessed rare populations of predominantly monosubstance-dependent (‘pure’) heroin and amphetamine users, many in protracted abstinence. In the parent DA021421 study, we have tested >800 participants with a comprehensive assessment battery of clinical, personality, and neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity and related externalizing and internalizing phenotypes. We genotyped participants with the Smokescreen array and enrolled siblings discordant for opiate and stimulant addictions. We combined theory-driven (e.g. cognitive modeling, joint modeling) with data-driven (e.g. machine learning (ML)) computational approaches, which proved particularly informative and revealed distinct multivariate risk profiles characterizing opiate and stimulant addictions with high degree of accuracy. Findings from the parent study significantly informed our integrative multidisciplinary framework (Vassileva & Conrod, 2019), which highlights the potential for distinct dimensions of impulsivity to inform clinical assessment and intervention development for different types of addictions. Impulsivity also figures prominently in the neuroscience-based heuristic framework for the neuroclinical assessment of addictions (ANA; Kwako et al., 2016), which proposes that successful addiction treatment must accommodate the heterogeneity and different etiological mechanisms implicated in addictions, by performing multidimensional assessments focusing on three neurofunctional domains of impulsivity and compulsivity: executive function (EF), incentive salience (IS), and negative emotionality (NE). However, because the ANA framework is based primarily on findings in alcohol use disorder, it is not well understood how these domains might generalize to other SUD, such as opiate and stimulant use disorders. The current competing renewal application aims to address this critical gap with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify key personality, neurobehavioral, polygenic, and computational markers of opiate and stimulant addiction following the ANA framework, using the comprehensive assessment battery and computational methods developed in the parent DA021421 with 250 participants (100 with opiate use disorder, 100 with stimulant use disorder, and 50 healthy controls); Aim 2: Identify the brain signatures of the 3 ANA domains (EF, IS, NE) in opiate and stimulant addictions; Exploratory Aim 3: Combine data from Aims 1 and 2 to identify addiction biotypes based on neurocircuitry implicated in the ANA domains. Project Narrative: Opiate and stimulant addictions remain significant public health problems worldwide. Despite revolutionary advances in our understanding of their neurobiological basis, much remains to be learned about different etiological factors underlying addiction heterogeneity. We have identified a unique cohort of substance users characterized by predominantly monosubstance-dependent patterns of opiate and stimulant use and by protracted abstinence, which may help decipher some of the neurobiological risk factors associated with different types of addiction.",Varieties of Impulsivity in Opiate and Stimulant Users,10299799,R01DA021421,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Back', 'Balkans', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Bulgaria', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychostimulant dependence', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Siblings', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'emotion dysregulation', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'heuristics', 'incentive salience', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'personalized intervention', 'polygenic risk score', 'programs', 'reward anticipation', 'stimulant use', 'stimulant use disorder', 'substance user', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trafficking']",NIDA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,10000
"Personalized Functional Network Modeling to Characterize and Predict Psychopathology in Youth ABSTRACT Intrinsic functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool to study the organization of functional networks (FNs) in the human brain. Rich and accumulating evidence demonstrates that FNs undergo predictable normative development in youth, and that abnormal development is associated with diverse psychopathology. Recent work based on advances in image analytics has established that FNs are in fact person-specific. When paired with large-scale neuroimaging datasets, person-specific FNs provide unprecedented translational opportunities for the development of new diagnostics that could guide personalized treatments for neuropsychiatric illnesses. However, the translational promise of person-specific FNs is at present hindered by several obstacles. First, current methods compute personalized FNs at a specific scale, despite clear evidence that the brain is a multi-scale system with a hierarchical functional organization. Second, to enforce correspondence across different subjects personalized FNs are typically computed under certain constraints, which may yield biased results. Third, deep learning has achieved mixed success in neuroimaging data analysis partially due to the fact that ad-hoc network architecture is typically adopted and feature learning capability is often deprived by adopting pre-engineered rather than learned features. Fourth, to correct site effects of neuroimaging measures from multiple datasets of large-scale neuroimaging studies current methods typically attempt to harmonize data prior to statistical modeling, resulting in loss of valuable information. Fifth, longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data are increasingly available, but effective analytic tools for longitudinal data are scarce. Last but not least, deep learning algorithms have been developed to analyze fcMRI data but are often released as poorly documented source code, limiting both reproducibility and adoption by translational researchers. In this application, we build on the success of the prior award period to address these limitations by developing, validating, and disseminating tools that characterize brain functional organization at an individual subject level. We will leverage complementary large-scale studies of brain development to validate our methods and delineate how abnormal development of FNs is associated with major dimensions of psychopathology in youth, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and ADHD-spectrum symptoms. Specifically, we will develop novel methods to 1) accurately identify bias-free personalized FNs with a multiscale hierarchical organization; 2) robustly predict psychiatric symptom dimensions using personalized FNs with optimized deep neural network architecture and integrated site-effect correction, and 3) effectively model longitudinal data of FNs to create predictive models of psychopathology. These tools will be released in a freely available, containerized software package to ensure frictionless portability across computing platforms and full reproducibility.

"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Free Will', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inherited', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bone', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human imaging', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,10237280,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical trial participant', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2021,1202772
"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10206140,K99EB029343,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Endocrine', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'dimensional analysis', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'executive function', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'longitudinal design', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'skills', 'skills training', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'young adult']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,126289
"Statistical methods for structural and functional integration in multi-modal neuroimaging data Abstract Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, affect millions of people worldwide and place a considerable burden on both patients and family members. Existing treatments for these disorders have limited efficacy, in part due the varied clinical manifestations, and to our narrow understanding of the impacted neural processes, particularly at the system (i.e., network) level. Two key elements of networks are the underlying infrastructure or physical connections between elements and the functional signaling between entities that rides on top of this infrastructure. Recent advancements in noninvasive imaging have given us the ability to quantify structural and functional relationships in the brain via diffusion MRI, resting-state functional MRI, respectively. The size and scope of datasets measuring network structure and function are increasing in neuroimaging, and other domains, which heightens the need for new statistical frameworks that make full use of the data. Our goal is to develop frameworks for the analysis of structure-function integration in large-scale and complex networks, applied to neuroimaging studies, but also broadly applicable. This proposal will introduce three analytic paradigms: Bayesian network modeling that uses a priori structure-function knowledge for simultaneous network anomaly detection and clinical severity prediction; density regression using optimal transport theory; and end-to-end prediction using deep neural networks. In our application, infrastructure will be measured via dMRI, while function will be measured rs-fMRI. Each of our frameworks will provide a unique means to integrate these distinct imaging modalities, while also respecting the unique information provided by each data type. We also propose a unique software development effort that creates an application program interface to core software and implementations as software as as a service hosted on cloud platforms.

"MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers SUMMARY The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patient’s unique version of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA, leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing in situ “biopsies”, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.  The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application. Narrative The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of multiple departments and schools at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and the Johns Hopkins University. The goal of this National Center is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring (Precision Medicine), and (ii) expediting the development of new medical technologies and drugs. We will provide training in these new advanced technologies, and disseminate them to other research centers and hospitals in the country and worldwide.","MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers",10270096,P41EB031771,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Anemia', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Public Health Schools', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Water', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'candidate marker', 'candidate validation', 'clinical care', 'clinical outcome assessment', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'glymphatic function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'medical schools', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'product development', 'prognostic', 'public-private partnership', 'quantitative imaging', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIBIB,HUGO W.

"OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS Project Summary/Abstract (Max 30 lines of text) Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been challenging to acquire consistent MRI measurements of MS disease burden. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina has emerged as a complementary source of imaging biomarkers, wherein retinal thickness measurements have been shown to correlate well with MS disease burden. As well, OCT angiography (OCTA)—a new imaging modality acquired with the same OCT scanner—yields multiple new biomarkers among which macular vessel density has been shown to correlate with MS disability. There is strong evidence that OCT and OCTA may provide much needed imaging biomarkers for MS, but there are remaining technical challenges to overcome. Many algorithms for computation of retinal layer thicknesses from OCT images have been developed, but measurement of longitudinal changes in individual MS subjects remains highly challenging, especially in MS where yearly changes are small relative to intrinsic measurement variations. We propose a novel iterative registration and deep learning segmentation algorithm for longitudinal OCT retinal image segmentation. Development of automatic algorithms for analysis of OCTA images is in an early stage and there are opportunities for significant improvements. We will develop a deep network for OCTA vessel segmentation and biomarker computation that both suppresses artifacts that are common in OCTA and provides consistent results across different scanners. As both OCT and OCTA become more widely used in the characterization and management of MS, it is becoming increasingly important to jointly characterize these biomarkers and relate them to disease status, which is currently characterized largely by clinical evaluations. We will address the central question of whether OCT and OCTA can be used to predict disease progression by developing a new disease progression score for MS based on multiple OCT and OCTA measurements as well as clinical and MRI biomarkers, acquired in both single and multiple imaging visits. The proposed research will: 1) Develop a fast, topologically-correct longitudinal segmentation method for the macula; 2) Develop a method for artifact-suppressed and consistent computation of OCTA features in the macula; 3) Develop a disease progression score to jointly characterize longitudinal retinal OCT and OCTA measurements in MS; and 4) Carry out longitudinal studies of healthy controls and people with MS using OCT and OCTA measurements. We will assess whether average features within the macula or features averaged over smaller segments yield better estimates of progression. We will also assess whether OCT alone or OCT together with OCTA provide better estimates of progression. Image processing and disease progression algorithms will be made freely available to the research community. The proposed research will greatly advance the use of OCT and OCTA in characterizing longitudinal changes in the retina, potentially leading to standard eye measurements for monitoring and managing MS and other neurological and eye diseases. Project Narrative Monitoring the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been challenging due to the inconsistency and variability of both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging assessments. This project will develop methods and software for analysis of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scans of the retina, both of which show correlation to disability in MS. At the conclusion of the grant, software implementing the methods will be made available to the research community in a highly portable computer language.",OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS,10127738,R01EY032284,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Play', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord Lesions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'advanced disease', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'ganglion cell', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning progression', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'portability', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'white matter']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,441023
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,10160747,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,833908
"Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction National studies show that drug use rates have increased in the last decade among women, comprising a major public health concern in the US. However, women are greatly underrepresented in neuroimaging studies, and the paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations contributes to a gap in the study of the sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Over the last decade, in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (conducted with previous support including R01DA023579, R01DA020949), we have thoroughly mapped the clinical symptoms of cocaine addiction to the neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). This model proposes that the drug assumes heightened salience at the expense of non-drug related reinforcement as associated with abnormalities in reward processing and concomitant decreases in inhibitory control, together increasing addiction severity (including craving, a proxy of relapse) in susceptible individuals. The iRISA model highlights the role of the dopaminergically innervated prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to mesolimbic and striatal subcortical regions as assessed functionally and structurally. However, the majority of this neuroimaging research has been accomplished in male individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD). In the current project we aim to expand the reach of iRISA by comparing equal numbers of male to female iCUD; to test this model’s generalizability (vs. drug specificity effects), we will also include individuals with opioid use disorder (iOUD). We will conduct functional MRI during reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity tasks, and, to inspect generalizability of results beyond task-related activations, during resting-state. Beyond functional activations and connectivity, anatomical scans will assess the underlying gray matter integrity. Across all aims, healthy controls will be included to establish norms. We hypothesize female iCUD to differ from male iCUD, or female controls, in a pattern indicative of enhanced vulnerability to iRISA inclusive of compensatory PFC activations and abnormalities in structural measures; iCUD vs. iOUD comparisons will be exploratory. The novelty of this proposal is further enhanced by an exploratory aim to compare, in a within- subjects design, menstrual cycle (and hormonal) effects and by developing sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to incorporate data from all imaging modalities to yield an automated group classification and addiction severity (including craving) prediction tool. Considering that the majority of research in addiction occurs in males, clarification of the sex differences in the neural underpinnings of iRISA could reinforce the importance of studying both genders and suggest that different treatment strategies may be effective in women (potentially of most impact when timed vis-à-vis menstrual cycle), contributing to the development of tailored (gender-based) treatment options. Including equal numbers of women and men would advance basic studies of drug addiction and ultimately save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects in future clinical trials. National studies show that there is more rapid increase in the use of all drugs of abuse by women compared with men, comprising a unique public health concern in the US. However, an overrepresentation of males in neuroimaging studies, and a paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations, contributes to an absence of a clear understanding of sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. The study of sex differences (and menstrual cycle/hormonal effects) in the neural underpinnings of reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity could advance basic neuroscience studies of drug addiction and save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects during future clinical (medication) trials. Ultimately, results could contribute to the development of individually tailored (gender-based) precision medicine interventions (e.g., to reduce craving).",Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction,10131173,R01DA048301,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Intoxication', 'Luteal Phase', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'design', 'drug of abuse', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'non-drug', 'opioid use disorder', 'precision medicine', 'psychostimulant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress reactivity', 'symptomatology', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,689316
"Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML) to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability, and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18–34 year-old OUD patients before and during the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment. The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1) grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques to elucidate the structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying treatment failure in young adults receiving treatment with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder. This project will unveil the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in XR-NTX treatment response in a population of high importance to the efforts to curb the opioid crisis. It will facilitate Dr. Zhenhao Shi's transition to an independent computational addiction neuroscientist and help inform future research of, and intervention strategies for, opioid addiction.",Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction,10214440,K01DA051709,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'ROC Curve', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Self-Examination', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,179874
"Using Machine Learning to predict daily PTSD and cannabis use disorder symptoms among non-treatment seeking veterans PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the highest co-occurring disorder among veterans who report problematic cannabis use. However, many veterans fail to seek or engage with health care services for both conditions, and as a result, increases in symptom severity and corresponding risk may go undetected and unmanaged. Although there is increasing interest in reaching non-treatment-seeking veterans by delivering just-in-time interventions via mobile devices, such interventions require a clear understanding of when veterans with PTSD and problematic cannabis use are at heightened risk for escalating symptoms. Despite ongoing efforts to identify veterans who need support for mental health and substance use difficulties at the time of reintegration (upon return from deployment), these efforts have achieved minimal success. Machine learning-- a special form of artificial intelligence that aids in classifying individuals into risk profiles--may have promise in improving risk assessment and symptom escalation. Machine learning algorithms applied to passively- collected data from mobile and wearable devices (e.g., accelerometer data, time spent looking at screens, sleep data, exercise, GPS data) could be a promising, minimal-burden strategy to detect periods of risk and ultimately inform just-in-time interventions. Passive data from smartphones and wearable devices has been used in machine learning algorithms to predict risk for PTSD and other conditions (e.g., depression), but has not been applied to the prediction of PTSD and cannabis use or the understanding of the interplay between these conditions. Although past research has successfully engaged veterans in passive data collection and this strategy would be lower-burden than active data collection, it is unclear whether this is a feasible approach in clinical applications. Thus, the objective of this application is to understand the utility of passive data, in conjunction with self-report data or alone, in predicting clinically significant escalations in PTSD symptoms and problematic cannabis use among non-treatment seeking veterans who have recently discharged from the military. Seventy-five male and female non-treatment-seeking veterans with a history of trauma exposure and past-month cannabis use who are within six months of civilian reintegration will be recruited online. Participants will be given a FitBit and install the passive and active data collection app on their smartphone (HeadSmart). They will complete a baseline and three monthly follow-up surveys. Further, over the observation period, veterans will complete brief daily surveys of PTSD symptoms and cannabis use, and passive data will be recorded. Passive and daily diary data will be analyzed in machine learning algorithms to predict symptom escalation and future caseness (e.g., presence of clinically significant increase) (Aim 1) and understand daily/weekly symptom interplay (Aim 2). We will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach (Aim 3). The results of this research will ultimately inform prevention or early intervention efforts among this high-need population of veterans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scientific goal of this project is to understand, more fully, how passive data (collected from smart phones and wearable devices) can aid in detecting clinically significant escalations in PTSD symptoms and cannabis use. We plan to assess changes in PTSD symptoms and cannabis use that occur at the daily and weekly level by utilizing both passive and active data collection techniques. We will use innovative machine learning techniques to determine points in time when PTSD symptoms and cannabis use escalate to inform just in time interventions for non-treatment seeking veterans.",Using Machine Learning to predict daily PTSD and cannabis use disorder symptoms among non-treatment seeking veterans,10217655,R21DA051802,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Iraq', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'data streams', 'diaries', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana use disorder', 'meetings', 'military veteran', 'new technology', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'preventive intervention', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'substance use', 'success', 'trauma exposure', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2021,255450
"Connectome-Based Prediction of Addiction Severity 7. Abstract The United States is currently facing an epidemic of fatalities associated with the use of multiple types of substances. Given this public health crisis, there is an urgent need to identify transdiagnostic, dimensional biomarkers of substance use disorders (SUDs). In the field of clinical neuroscience, traditional, group-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approaches have struggled to identify predictive biomarkers of addiction that replicate across samples, possibly due to methods that (a) overfit the data and (b) examine different SUDs in isolation. To address this, the first objective of this application is to leverage recent advances in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a data-driven machine-learning approach, to identify patterns of functional connectivity (“neural fingerprints”) that are predictive of a transdiagnostic, dimensional measure of SUD severity at the individual level. Further, as opposed to single-modality research, NIDA has outlined the need to examine the complex interactions of factors across biological, psychological, and environmental domains (Priority Focus #1) in order to understand the real-word complexity of SUD vulnerability (Priority Focus #3). In line with these priorities, the second objective of this application is to integrate SUD-related whole-brain metrics into multilevel models of addiction vulnerability that include well-established psychological and environmental risk factors. The proposed research will make use of archival data collected as part of two independent studies (N = 242). Clinical assessments, self-report data, and resting-state fMRI data were collected from a diverse sample of community adults, elevated on illicit drug use, with 43% meeting criteria for a lifetime SUD and 81% reporting a history of illicit drug use. We hypothesize that a CPM-derived neural network will emerge in relation to SUD severity in the training sample that can be used to accurately predict SUD severity in another independent sample (Aim #1). This is expected to produce a working neural model that can be further tested and applied to make highly-individualized predictions of SUD severity in other, unseen samples. Next, we hypothesize that these networks will contribute unique variance to a multi-faceted model of addiction vulnerability, above and beyond well-established psychological and environmental risk factors (Aim #2). The integration of knowledge across multiple domains makes this application well-situated to address the real-world complexity of SUDs, and thus presents an opportunity for significant advances towards the development of precision medicine methods. This F31 application will provide opportunities for the applicant’s training in two critical areas: (a) the technical skills necessary to implement machine learning approaches to isolate brain networks with predictive power to identify individual differences in SUD severity and (b) the conceptualization and design of multi-faceted models that incorporate factors from multiple domains of analysis to characterize addiction vulnerability. 8. Project Narrative Although extant human neuroimaging research has identified a number of aberrant brain networks associated with addiction, it has struggled to produce reliable predictive biomarkers of substance use disorders (SUDs). To address this, the objective of this application is to leverage recent advances in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to identify functional neural networks that are predictive of SUD severity at the individual level, and to test the relative contribution of these novel neural metrics in integrated models of latent addiction vulnerability. The proposed training and research plans are intended to advance understanding of the multidimensional nature of addiction and further develop the applicants’ program of research that seeks to elucidate the biopsychosocial processes underlying addiction.",Connectome-Based Prediction of Addiction Severity,10232857,F31DA053782,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'biomarker performance', 'biopsychosocial', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'connectome data', 'design', 'discounting', 'experience', 'illicit drug use', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge integration', 'meetings', 'multilevel analysis', 'multiple drug use', 'network models', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'personalized predictions', 'polysubstance use', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'stimulant use', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,F31,2021,46036
"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,10163115,R01AG054628,"['3 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Care', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'biobank', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'feature selection', 'functional independence', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'social', 'sociodemographic predictors', 'sociodemographics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,470535
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,10174657,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,672964
"ENIGMA World Aging Center ABSTRACT One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another dementia - diseases that cost the nation $259 billion, to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2017). Despite the vast personal and economic cost of these diseases, two major barriers stall efforts to discover key biological mechanisms that influence brain aging. First, the sheer cost of data collection means that most national initiatives have limited power to detect factors that affect brain aging. Even in datasets of N=1,000+ people (e.g., ADNI) – the power to discover modulators of brain aging is limited and may not generalize worldwide. Second, with the crisis of reproducibility, we do not always know if a finding will replicate; and if not, if this is due to true population heterogeneity or problems with methods. ENIGMA offers a coordinated global approach to solve these problems. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a global brain aging study that builds on our vast and highly productive ENIGMA consortium - a global network of 340 institutions in 45 countries. ENIGMA published the largest-ever genetic studies of the brain (Nature 2017; Science 2020), and the largest neuroimaging studies of 5 major psychiatric disorders. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a concerted global effort to pool all available data, methods, expertise and capital infrastructure to discover factors that affect brain aging. Our long-term goal is to identify personalized biological predictors of brain structural and functional decline and assess how they generalize globally. We have 4 aims: Aim 1: ENIGMA-Lifespan. Develop Lifespan Charts for Brain and Neural Tract Aging in 20,000 people. We will create charts showing how MRI brain measures change throughout life in 20,000 people, aged 1-92. We will compute a composite brain aging score, `Brain Age', from available MRI, DTI, rsFMRI data, that measures how much the brain deviates from expected values, for a person's age and sex. Aim 2: ENIGMA-Epigenetics. Relate genome-wide methylation levels to brain metrics in 10,000+ people, to discover epigenetic markers of accelerated brain aging. We discovered 2 epigenetic loci promoting brain aging in pilot studies. We will compute a “epigenetic clock” and test if it predicts brain metrics better than simple biological age. Aim 3: ENIGMA-Plasticity. Discover genomic loci that promote or mitigate brain tissue loss, in > 37 worldwide cohorts with longitudinal MRI. Aim 4: ENIGMA-Alzheimer's Disease (New Aim). Meta-analyze the role of APOE, AD polygenic risk, and a new risk score for accelerated atrophy on neuroimaging biomarkers in aging and AD, including amyloid and FDG PET. These aims seek to analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods. We aim to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and epigenome, test how and when they shift AD biomarkers, and test their generalizability worldwide. NARRATIVE To address reproducibility and power issues in aging and Alzheimer's disease research, we launch ENIGMA's World Aging Center, a global brain study of aging and AD across 45 countries. Leveraging our ENIGMA network (340 institutions), we launch 4 coordinated projects to empower genetic and epigenetic studies of brain aging: (1) Enigma-Lifespan- creates normative charts of brain aging metrics from MRI, diffusion imaging, and functional MRI in 20,000 people worldwide; (2) ENIGMA-Epigenetics- relates genome-wide methylation to brain aging; (3) ENIGMA-Plasticity- seeking genetic loci affecting brain atrophy rates; and (4) ENIGMA-Alzheimer's- to identify how Alzheimer's genetic risk and new risk scores for accelerated tissue loss, affect the brain. We will analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods, to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and blood, worldwide.",ENIGMA World Aging Center,10119038,R01AG058854,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Atrophic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Capital', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Status', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Carriers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guanine', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Priorities', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nomograms', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Proxy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tract', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'economic cost', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'executive function', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'functional decline', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'global health', 'glucose metabolism', 'hazard', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging genetics', 'indexing', 'inorganic phosphate', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural tract', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'polygenic risk score', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'sex', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,696496
"Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry Project Summary The Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR) is a repository designed for sharing data across the NIH-funded national network of Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs). The IASDR hosted and maintained by the OAIC’s Coordinating Center (CC). As a domain-specific repository, the existing IASDR contains multiple data sets generated from aging studies conducted at the Wake Forest OAIC (WF-OAIC), as well as a biospecimen bank for samples collected from some of the included studies. The IASDR thus serves as a valuable resource for the aging research community, especially for early career faculty. The data repository befits early career investigators who want to conduct small pilot studies for testing out conjectures and research hypotheses, and to efficiently produce useful information such as preliminary effect sizes for grant applications or to power future studies. Gaps were identified when the IASDR was evaluated against modern repository requirements. The IASDR was first started more than a decade ago, and the development process did not necessarily strictly adhere to contemporary biomedical-data repository principles such as the FAIR and TRUST principles. Importantly, barriers are present for users in accessing key information for decision support. For example, currently summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency for variables and association information between variables, which are often critical in helping users to decide whether or not to pursue actual data, are not present in the IASDR metadata. The lack of such preliminary information could deter interested users from using the repository. To address gaps and limitations of the IASDR as related to its “FAIR”-ness and “TRUST”- worthiness, this proposal contains two specific aims: (1) Enhance the metadata layer by providing users with key analytic information such as mean, frequency, and association between variables, and (2) improve the IASDR along the FAIR and TRUST principles and seek certification. Project Narrative The proposed project improves an existing data repository, the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR), which contains both data and biospecimen from multiple aging studies, along principles for modern data repository. The improvement will increase usability and confidence of the aging research user community.",Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry,10408207,U24AG059624,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aging', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Capsicum', 'Certification', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Infrastructure', 'Journals', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Modernization', 'Paper', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'TRUST principles', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visual', 'career', 'computer center', 'cost', 'data access', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'design', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multiple datasets', 'repository', 'statistics', 'study characteristics', 'synergism', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2021,232275
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,10186677,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'dietary', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,638984
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth - Supplement Project Summary/Abstract - no change from original The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH’s mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. Project Narrative - no change from original The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth - Supplement,10397801,R01MH059929,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Youth', 'comorbidity', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'protective factors', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,64312
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data.

"Protein Signatures of APOE2 and Cognitive Aging Improving AI/ML readiness of data generated under the R01: Protein signatures of APOE2 and AG061844 “Protein signatures of APOE2 and cognitive aging”, we are generating proteomic and metabolomics data in a cohort of centenarians, their offspring, and unrelated controls from the New England Centenarian Study (NECS). Study participants have been characterized with detailed medical history, genetic profiles, and longitudinal assessment of physical and cognitive functions. The goal of the parent R01 is to validate a proteomic signature of APOE genotypes, and to evaluate its value together with metabolic profiles to predict patterns of cognitive function change in aging individuals. We plan to share data through the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) portal, and the new extreme longevity (EL) portal that is currently under development. Sharing the data in an unrestricted manner is not possible because they include HIPAA identifiers, particularly age >89. Unrestricted sharing of data would be an attractive option for AI/ML investigators, and the goal of this request for administrative supplement is to cognitive aging. Funded by the NIA: R01 use advanced machine learning techniques to generate high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the data obtained in the parent achine learning methods have emerged that can be used to generate synthetic data using a model that is trained in the real data. This model can be used to generate a synthetic data set in which no single data point corresponds to a real person in the original data set, but the synthetic data can be analyzed to produce results that are like those derived from the original data. This approach has received substantial attention in the past few years, and it has been adopted to compromise between data sharing and privacy, including generation of synthetic data for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We have put together a team of data scientists and partners from the company Syntegra R01 so they can be shared without restriction. M , to generate and validate a synthetic data set that matches the data generated with the parent R01. Our proposal is structured in three aims. In Aim 1, we will share with Syntegra real data from the NECS that include proteomics and metabolomics, genetic variables and patients’ characteristics including assessment of cognitive function. This real data will be used to train the data generation model and create synthetic data sets. In Aim 2 we will d evelop a protocol for validation of the synthetic data sets that includes fidelity to a variety of results of machine learning analyses and metrics to assess the deidentification of data. In Aim 3 we will conduct the analysis in the real and synthetic data sets and compare the results. Impact. This is a high risk, but potentially high return proposal. If the approach works, we will be able to generate data that can be widely shared with the community. The approach will also be applicable to several other studies of aging that struggle with the issues of data sharing to enhance scientific research while preserving privacy. Narrative The goal of this application is to develop a model trained in real data generated from the parent R01 and use the model to simulate a high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the real data that can be shared without restriction. The impact of this strategy is to simplify sharing data with the AI/ML community, thus increasing the usability of the data and the potential impact of the parent R01.

"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,10171752,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,995375
"Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging Project Summary Understanding the biochemical processes underlying aging that give rise to age-related pathologies is the central concept of geroscience research. A focus in geroscience is to identify interventions that slow/prevent aging. These could both alter the trajectory of aging and have beneficial effects across a number of diseases, delaying onset or slowing progression. However, evaluating anti-aging interventions requires years-long studies in mammalian model organisms and is almost impossible in clinical trials that would require of multi-year studies to evaluate lifespan and healthspan extensions. The solution to this problem lies in developing endpoints that indicate biological age and the health-related changes that go with it with sufficient sensitivity. The recent development of epigenetic clocks, chronological age-predictive machine learning models that use DNA cytosine methylation data, are leading the field in age estimation accuracy and precision. The difference between a person’s chronological age and the estimated “methylation age” has been proposed as a measure of aging acceleration or deceleration – a ‘biological age’. Age acceleration predicted by methylation has shown robust correlations to all-cause mortality risk, but weak correlations in age-related diseases. Age-related biological outcomes such as cognitive decline have found little to no association with methylation age acceleration. Put simply, epigenetic clocks have been developed to predict chronological age but have so far demonstrated marginal utility to predict disease states. However, our preliminary results indicate that as many as 20% of genomic cytosines have age-related methylation changes which may be leveraged to understand biological aging and its outcomes simultaneously. Using the largest collection of methylation data with disease, age, tissue, and sex labels from our previous work in natural language processing, we will create the first model of epigenetic aging to identify “healthy” aging loci and disease-predictive loci. These loci will give us insight into the molecular pathways disturbed by age-related methylation changes, providing targets for therapeutic intervention and a predictor for patient disease risk. However, it is still unknown how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’, especially considering their performance across tissues. We will test how epigenetic changes with age are distributed throughout specific cell types in the central nervous system and cell types common across all tissues – such as vascular endothelium and immune cells. Using single-cell bisulfite sequencing and cell-type specific promoter-driven labelling, we can detect if the epigenetic clock changes are truly occurring in all cells or if they are restricted to some cell types common across tissues. This information is critical for predicting the downstream effects of changes identified by epigenetic clocks and interpreting the effects of ‘reversing’ epigenetic aging. These experiments will further our understanding of the role epigenetics play in the aging process and in neurological diseases of age such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Project Narrative Epigenetic clocks, models of DNA methylation changes with age, have been shown as robust biomarkers for aging and all-cause mortality risk, but weakly predict disease risk and thus biological aging. This proposed research plan will generate a new epigenetic model by identifying loci predictive of both age and disease to create an Epigenetic Vulnerability Estimator (EVE), granting insights into disease-associated pathways affected by DNA methylation aging. We will also determine how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’ in the brain using cell-type specific single-cell bisulfite sequencing to understand what cellular populations are reflecting both age-related epigenetic dysregulation and potentially responding to anti-aging interventions.",Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging,10295753,F31AG063493,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deceleration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Euchromatin', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methylation', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phagocytes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Ribosomes', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Ticks', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'animal data', 'anti aging', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sex', 'single cell sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,F31,2021,34517
"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10227218,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'career', 'cohesion', 'dynamic system', 'fundamental research', 'geriatric neuropsychiatry', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2021,125010
"Neural markers of impending task performance PROJECT ABSTRACT The neural mechanisms underlying successful cognitive performance are not well understood. In this R03 project, we will thoroughly investigate the ability to predict behavioral improvements through changes in shared underlying neural mechanisms. Identifying neural metrics that predict individual performance gains will ensure more reliable behavioral outcomes across diverse populations with varying cognitive capabilities and age ranges. Additionally, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying successful cognition will allow for rescuing of lost cognitive abilities and prophylaxis of cognitive decline in aging and other vulnerable populations such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recently identified several signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlated with cognitive performance improvements following and intervention with cognitive training and/or noninvasive neurostimulation. Specifically, frontal midline power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) correlates with improved divided attention ability and transfer to improved sustained attention ability in older adults (Anguera et al., 2013), and frontoparietal connectivity in the theta band is linked to improved attention (Anguera et al., 2013) and working memory (Jones et al., 2017). In addition to band- limited theta, we found that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta oscillations and temporo-parietal gamma (>30 Hz) activity tracked individual performance gains in working memory following intervention with training and neurostimulation (Jones et al., 2020). These findings suggest that theta oscillations, as measured by power, connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling in task-relevant regions, underlie individual differences in cognitive performance. Indeed, the application of noninvasive neurostimulation confirmed the critical role of theta oscillations in divided attention by showing that direct entrainment of frontal theta oscillations further enhanced performance (Hsu et al., 2017, 2018). The proposed research will determine the mechanisms by which theta oscillations, assessed at baseline, predict subsequent cognitive performance outcomes in aging and vulnerable populations. Critically, we identified preliminary evidence that an individual's intrinsic peak theta frequency predicted the efficacy of theta entrainment with neurostimulation on divided attention ability. This important preliminary result demonstrates that a nuanced approach to tailoring an intervention to the individual is feasible. Here, our analyses seek to predict subsequent performance during divided attention prior to intervention (Aim 1) and before trial onset in a range of cognitive tasks (Aim 2). We will conduct comprehensive regularized multiple regression and deep learning analyses on 13 existing EEG datasets, several of which share the same divided attention task, yet vary in participant demographics, including age and cognitive capability (healthy older and younger adults, multi-domain amnestic MCI patients), to develop a predictive model for an individually-tailored cognitive intervention. The results will inform future research that seeks to maximize the reliability of intervention protocols across demographics at any age or cognitive capability. PROJECT NARRATIVE This grant proposal seeks to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for behavioral improvement through novel secondary analyses on a variety of cognitive tasks (divided attention, working memory, perceptual discrimination) and participants that range from healthy younger adults, healthy older adults, and multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The goal will be to fit identified oscillatory neural metrics within a model that can predict cognitive performance through the use of advanced EEG and deep learning analyses. This predictive model will be of public health importance as the outcome will allow for tailoring of cognitive prophylaxis, rehabilitation, and interventions in healthy, at-risk, and in clinical populations.",Neural markers of impending task performance,10218883,R03AG065966,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Ensure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'aging population', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive training', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'demographics', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'sustained attention', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2021,161500
"Machine learning for brain and epigenetic aging in neurodegenerative diseases Project Summary/Abstract Accurate quantiﬁcation of aging for different organ systems enables detection of any deviation from typical aging and identiﬁcation of early onset of a disease characterized by accelerated aging, and thus provides opportunities for early intervention. The brain-Predicted Age Difference (brainPAD) is a new clinical informatics framework deﬁned as the difference between the brain-derived age and the chronological age of the individual. It has been suggested that brainPAD correlates with physical ﬁtness, cognitive performance, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, several limitations remain in current brainPAD models. Models with large age range yield prediction error larger than 5 years and are often derived from a single-modal imaging feature set (e.g. only structural data). Moreover, due to known inﬂuence of sex differences on brain morphology, existing models are trained on male and female separately, which may pose challenges in studies with small sample size and in interpretation across models. Finally, because of the phenomenon of regression to the mean, predicted age is overestimated in younger individuals and underestimated in older, which can lead to false positive associations of brainPAD with variables of interest, such as disease status.  To address these limitations, this proposal aims to develop and apply novel machine learning algorithms and biomedical software to increase the model accuracy and robustness in three Speciﬁc Aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a novel feature selection method to identify brain features inﬂuencing brainPAD; 2) Apply the novel machine learning framework to explore different data types and feature types provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); 3) Develop and validate integrative methods to create new measures of clinically abnormal aging and compute these measures on the ADNI longitudinal data. Addressing the existing bias and accounting for confounding effects, the new and more accurate measures of a person's age from their brain and epigenetic signatures will provide insights into what causes atypical aging and help predict the onset and individual trajectory of progression in speciﬁc neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Project Narrative The ability to objectively quantify the degree of aging for different organ systems is central to identifying underly- ing biological mechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.

"Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research Project Summary It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well. Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions, site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement. Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging. Project Narrative The goal of this R25 program is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the fields of Biostatistics and quantitative Public Health, with a collaborative focus on the diseases and processes of aging. The program includes an intensive six-week summer program for 12 students, with formal and informal instruction, mentored research, and extensive professional development activities, with a culminating symposium.

"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10260623,K99AG068544,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Bioethics', 'Biology of Aging', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Geroscience', 'Global Change', 'Glutamine', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Immunologist', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Polymerase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell age', 'genome-wide', 'healthspan', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'influenza A pneumonia', 'influenza infection', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pneumonia model', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'proteostasis', 'resilience', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stoichiometry', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,122861
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies.

"Diversity Candidate Research Supplement to Study Human Cell Models of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks.

"Administrative Supplement to Support Collaborations to Improve AI/ML-Readiness SUMMARY This application is for an administrative supplement (revision) to an existing award, R33AG068931, ""Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets."" The goal of the parent study is to create a comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory datasets and to demonstrate their utility for aging research at Rutgers University through 4 specific aims: 1) Harmonizing and merging multiple data sets to generate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels and across multiple domains, 2) Developing state-of-the-art analytic methods to identify patterns of aging trajectories experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes, 3) Discovering multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajectories using both model-based approaches and machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes, and 4) Disseminating resources generated including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology. For the supplement, new work in the CMS Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC) will create AI/ML-ready datasets, workflows, and source code for data cleaning and pre-processing, breaking the siloed barriers between researchers working in the VRDC and institutional data enclaves at Universities. Data harmonization procedures need to be customized to the server architecture and resources of each data warehouse, necessitating VRDC-specific workflows and code to ensure timely access and reproducibility. In this project, data are made AI/ML-ready in four stages: 1) the cohort of patients to be studied is defined and key inclusion and exclusion criteria variables are selected; 2) data pre-processing steps include data cleaning, data annotation, formatting, standardizing taxonomies, variables transformation, data rescale/normalization, variable aggregating, variable decomposing and variable selection with a focus on variables important to measure health disparities and improve minority health and reduce health disparities; 3) feature extraction and engineering include generating derived variables (e.g., intercept, slope, average, etc.) from irregularly spaced individual trajectories; and 4) Medicare data sets are merged with publicly available data to add socioeconomic and environmental context, and data variable relationships are mapped to produce a final, AI/ML-ready data. Supplement Aim. Develop and implement code for data pre-processing, data fine-tuning and precision, missing data imputation, data connectivity and fully established hierarchical relationships for the AI/ML framework to interactively model late-life aging trajectories and selected outcomes in a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries. Completion of this work will contribute to the NIH vision of a modernized and integrated biomedical data ecosystem that adopts the latest data science technologies, and best practice guidelines including FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles and open-source development. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the health and social care needs of an aging population. The interaction between individual and environmental factors that impact clinical aging outcomes in the final years of life are explored using state-of-the-art analytic methods.

"Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S. adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years. Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years, with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.  Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics. However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.  In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi- lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis, which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease and understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, and the impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA. In this proposal subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort and we will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based measures of cartilage degeneration and determine the role of gait biomechanics on disease progression.","Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics",10317687,R01AR069006,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Cartilage Matrix', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteoglycan', 'Relaxation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Water', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cartilage degradation', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint destruction', 'kinematics', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'obese person', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'skeletal']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,709418
"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging,10226360,R13AG069519,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically significant', 'data complexity', 'data mining', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenomics', 'frailty', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'graduate student', 'health economics', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'senescence', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R13,2021,34380
"Methods to Test the Role of Age-related Lifestyle and Vaginal Microenvironment Changes and the Prevention, Treatment, and Progression of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), a progressive, chronic condition related to estrogen decline that includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, reduced sexual desire, and other signs and symptoms. GSM symptoms are a costly public health concern and worsen if untreated. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced accumulation of vaginal glycogen and shifts in vaginal microbiota. These include low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of postmenopausal women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by lactic acid production and hypothesized anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned about side effects. While vaginal lubricants provide some relief, many are toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. Thus, new ways to treat and prevent GSM are needed. Because lactobacilli are often reduced in menopause, vaginal microbiota are plausible treatment targets; however, probiotics alone have not been proven effective. Also, age-related changes in vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles; but, the cross- talk between these molecular features and their role in GSM is unknown. We hypothesize that core vaginal micro-environment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that increases in menopause but may be modifiable by lifestyle factors. Prospective studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they affect GSM. To achieve this goal, we will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected from 812 women aged 35-60 years with clinical visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). We will quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors) and metabolites (GC/LC-MS) in cervicovaginal samples. A novelty of this proposed project is that we will develop, validate, and apply new statistical methods for complex longitudinal data that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and compositional microbiome data analyses. These methods will provide a rigorous framework to handle missing data and confounding that has been a major limitation in many microbiome studies. The ultimate public health impact is that findings from this project have potential to inform development of new therapy to prevent or treat GSM to promote women’s health. Our team has the expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for this systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause for some women, and we hypothesize that these changes may lead to worsening vulvovaginal symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how age-related changes in the vaginal microenvironment (bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles) impact genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. This study will inform molecular targets of intervention that that can lead to new therapies to promote healthy aging.","Methods to Test the Role of Age-related Lifestyle and Vaginal Microenvironment Changes and the Prevention, Treatment, and Progression of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause",10091738,R01AG069915,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Archives', 'Atrophic', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Biometry', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Estrogen Therapy', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Gynecology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Inflammaging', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Lactic acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Lubricants', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Menopausal Symptom', 'Menopausal Syndrome', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Perimenopause', 'Play', 'Postmenopause', 'Prevention', 'Prevotella', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Dysfunction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Streptococcus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taurine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Vulva', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'biological specimen archives', 'cervicovaginal', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'dietary supplements', 'dysbiosis', 'healthy aging', 'hormonal contraception', 'hormone therapy', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'modifiable lifestyle factors', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'repository', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'urogenital tract', 'vaginal dryness', 'vaginal lactobacilli', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,660371
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-throughput metabolomic studies have shown promise in elucidating potential pathways underpinning aging processes and longevity. However, data in human populations are still constrained by small sample sizes and a limited number of metabolites profiled. Existing studies have also not integrated data on diet and lifestyle to evaluate the associations of interest in a comprehensive manner. A better understanding of aging- related metabolic alterations and whether metabolite profiles are modulated by lifestyle factors is crucial to develop effective strategies to promote health and well-being. The main goal is to identify novel metabolite profiles associated with mortality and prolonged longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of lifestyle factors are associated with mortality and longevity. We propose to leverage unique resources from two large U.S. cohorts with long follow-up and extended lifespan data: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n~8,100). The results will be replicated in two independent populations: the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) (n~2,300), and the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) Study (n~3,000), a population at high cardiovascular risk in Spain. This research application is aimed at: (1) identifying plasma metabolomic profiles and networks associated with mortality and longevity; and, (2) identifying the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score and examining its prospective association with mortality and longevity. The proposed project is built on the numerous strengths of existing cohort studies in U.S. and Mediterranean populations, and supporting results from the preliminary work conducted by our multi- disciplinary team. Findings from this study will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of longevity and advance our understanding of how plasma metabolomics may mediate the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk. The proposed research will generate new knowledge that can directly inform specific lifestyle interventions applicable in clinical settings to improve the health and well-being of adults as they age. The proposed research will provide a wealth of preliminary data to stimulate further research on longevity and healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to leverage unique resources with longitudinal data to identify metabolite profiles and networks associated with total mortality and longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score are associated with the risk of mortality and longevity, in U.S. and Mediterranean populations. This study has the potential to identify novel metabolic signatures of both mortality and longevity and improve our understanding of how lifestyle factors modulate metabolites and mortality risk, which can help to design better preventive and intervention strategies.","Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk",10298057,R21AG070375,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthy Eating', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Spain', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'healthy aging', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'lifestyle intervention', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoking', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2021,239250

"Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning Project Summary/Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies shows mounting evidence that neurodegenerative diseases manifest distinct network dysfunction patterns much earlier prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Since the subject-specific longitudinal network changes are more relevant to the neuropathological process than topological patterns derived from cross-sectional data, recognizing the subtle and dynamic longitudinal network biomarkers from noisy network data is of great demand to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of computer-assisted diagnosis in neurodegenerative diseases. However, current popular statistical inference or machine learning approaches used for neuroimages (in a regular data structure such as grid and lattice) are not fully optimized for the learning task on brain network data which is often encoded in a high dimensional graph (an irregular and non-linear data structure). Such gross adaption is partially responsible for the lack of reliable biomarkers that can be used to predict cognitive decline in routine clinical practice. To address this challenge, we aim to (1) develop a novel GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to hierarchically discover the multi-scale network biomarkers that can recognize the disease-relevant network alterations over time, and (2) examine the diagnostic power of the new network biomarkers derived from our GNN-based machine learning engine across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. The success of this project will allow us to integrate the novel GNN-based learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis toolbox and release the AI (artificial intelligence) based network analysis software to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to continue the tool development of longitudinal network analysis for neurodegenerative diseases with the focus on the machine learning component. To do so, we will first develop the GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to discover the multi-scale network biomarkers from the population of brain network data. After examining the diagnostic value of the network biomarkers discovered by our learning- based method across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia, we will integrate the machine learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis software and release to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community.",Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning,10109509,R03AG070701,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'collaboratory', 'comparison group', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'network dysfunction', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2021,158733
"Dietary Quality, Body Adiposity, and Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Women 7. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease, characterized by persistent synovitis and systemic inflammation. RA is generally considered as a multifactorial disease, caused by both genetic factors and environmental exposures. Although some individual dietary factors have been identified to be associated with the development of RA, few studies have examined the effects of overall dietary quality and dietary patterns on RA risk. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or following a Prudent dietary pattern is associated with reduced RA risk, while a Western dietary pattern or a dietary inflammatory pattern, characterized by high intakes of red and processed meats, refined grains, desserts and sweets, and high-fat dairy products, increases RA risk in young and middle-aged women. However, little is known about whether modifying dietary quality influences subsequent RA risk. Often, it is not ethically or practically possible to conduct a perfectly randomized trial to study diet and risk of rare diseases, instead large longitudinal studies with repeated dietary measures can provide unique opportunities to evaluate the effect of diet changes on RA risk reduction using advanced causal inference models, which will have direct relevance for populations at highest risk such as first degree relatives of RA patients.  Dietary factors directly and indirectly play an important role in the genesis of obesity. Individuals with obesity are at increased risk of major chronic diseases. We also identified obesity as a significant risk factor of RA, although the biologic mechanism is not yet understood. Further study is needed to evaluate the influences of weight gain or weight loss on the risk of RA using causal models. The adipokines produced by the adipose tissue, leading to a chronic inflammatory state, may play a central role in the development of obesity-related complications.  In this application we propose to evaluate the modification of dietary quality as a potential strategy to prevent future development of RA using well-established causal inference models: Marginal Structural Models. This study also extends our earlier work to examine the influences of weight changes and body fat distribution on RA risk. We will also examine whether circulating adipokines associated with an increased risk of developing RA, and mediate the observed associations of dietary quality and obesity with RA risk in a matched case-control study nested in NHS and NHS II cohorts. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will be the first and largest of its kind to prospectively evaluate the causal influences of dietary quality modification and body weight changes on future RA risk. This study will also examine the biological mechanisms linking overall dietary quality, obesity and body fat distribution with RA development in a biomarker study.","Dietary Quality, Body Adiposity, and Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Women",9893820,R01AR071326,"['Adherence', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Central obesity', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dairy Products', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Grain', 'Healthy Eating', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Leptin', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Processed Meats', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproductive History', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Structural Models', 'Synovitis', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adipokines', 'case control', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'cost efficient', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'obesity development', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'resistin', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'trend', 'waist circumference', 'young adult']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,480060
"Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the ubiquitous role of fibrosis in tissue dysfunction arising from aging and disease, no representative in vitro model of the fibrotic microenvironment exists. Fibrosis is characterized by excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition that stiffens the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, to model fibrosis in vitro, cell culture substrates that permit quantitative, dynamic tuning of matrix mechanics and composition are necessary. However, existing dynamic hydrogel culture platforms generally rely on chemistries that may be toxic to cells or that simultaneously change multiple parameters, making it difficult to assign causal relationships between altered matrix properties and cell fate changes. Fibrotic stiffening occurs in a wide range of tissues, including skeletal muscle. Along with increased fibrosis, the regenerative function of skeletal muscle decreases with aging. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are responsible for maintaining and repairing muscle throughout life and are known to be acutely mechanosensitive, losing their stem cell potential when cultured on stiff substrates. Thus, the stiffened, fibrotic microenvironment may contribute to the diminished regenerative capacity of aged MuSCs. The goal of this project is to develop an in vitro model of tissue fibrosis based on dynamic hydrogel biomaterials and to employ this model to identify molecular mechanisms of MuSC mechanosensing that are implicated in MuSC dysfunction in aging. The mentored phase of this proposal will provide advanced technical training in aging biology, transgenic mouse models, cellular traction force measurement, and machine learning approaches for bioinformatics. This training will enable an independent research program leveraging dynamic biomaterials to deconvolve the complex interactions of mechanical forces, matrix biochemistry, and cell-cell signaling that dictate the progression of aging and disease. Additional structured training in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and research management will facilitate the transition to independence, supported by a committee of faculty from the Stanford Schools of Medicine and Engineering.  Aim 1 will optimize a synthetic hydrogel system that uses near-infrared light and bioorthogonal reactions to dynamically stiffen the gels, mimicking fibrosis. These hydrogels will be used to elucidate mechanisms of mechanosensing in MuSCs, using FRET-based force sensors and transgenic mouse models. Aim 2 will model muscle aging in vitro, using dynamically stiffening gels modified with ECM components characteristic of aging. Single cell RNA sequencing and machine learning bioinformatics approaches will identify unique mechanically regulated drivers of cell fate that reduce MuSC regenerative potential in aging. Aim 3 will develop novel materials for 3D cell culture with dynamic tuning of viscoelastic properties to establish the first human model of muscle “aging in a dish.” This project stands to identify new therapeutic targets to improve muscle function with aging and to develop engineered platforms to study numerous heritable diseases and aging in diverse tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fibrosis, which causes dysfunction and ultimate failure of numerous tissues with aging, is characterized in part by increased tissue stiffness. Despite the profound impact of fibrosis on the health of our aging population, no adequate model system exists to study fibrotic stiffening on individual cells in real-time. This project aims to develop a dynamic material platform that enables user-directed manipulation of stiffness and to apply this system to identify aging-related changes in muscle stem cells that could lead to novel therapies to improve muscle function in aged individuals.",Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials,10299996,K99AG071738,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Adhesives', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Biology of Aging', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Functional disorder', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ failure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Reaction', 'Regenerative capacity', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transplantation', 'Writing', 'adult stem cell', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'bioluminescence imaging', 'crosslink', 'force sensor', 'genetic approach', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mechanotransduction', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'muscle aging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase', 'programs', 'regeneration function', 'regeneration potential', 'repaired', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem cell function', 'stem cell niche', 'stem cell population', 'stem cells', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptomics', 'viscoelasticity', 'wound healing']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,120166
"Metabolites of Dietary Intake and Risk of Knee Osteoarthritis PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the major cause of activity limitation and physical disability in older people. In the absence of disease modifying therapy, there is an urgent need for effective, widely available approaches to aid in the prevention and management of this common condition. Dietary factors associated with inflammation, obesity and other metabolic risk factors appear to play a role in OA pathogenesis. However, few human studies have studied the association between dietary factors and risk of future knee OA development. We have preliminary data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a large cohort with repeated measures of OA symptoms and radiographic outcomes, demonstrating that the Western dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of red/ processed meats, refined grains, desserts / sweets, was associated with increased risk of radiographic knee OA. In contrast, the Prudent dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits/ vegetables, legumes, whole grains, poultry, and fish was associated with reduced risk of knee OA. Hence, adherence to a healthy diet may provide a potential strategy for the prevention of knee OA. However, self-report dietary assessment methods, such as food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and diet records, may be subject to recall bias and measurement error. Biomarkers of dietary intake taking into account the nutrient bioavailability and metabolism may better represent a long-term nutritional status. Recently, metabolomics, by measuring a large number of downstream components or metabolic products (metabolites), provides the most integrated profile of biological status reflecting environmental, dietary and genetic interactions, and therefore may more precisely define dietary exposures and provide better estimates of disease risk in epidemiologic studies. To date, intervention studies have identified a variety of metabolites related to the dietary intake of major foods. More than 50 of them have been validated by multiple studies. To date, no study has ever assessed the association between metabolites of dietary intake and future risk of knee OA. We propose a nested case-control study in OAI cohort including 261 incident knee OA cases and 261 matched controls to examine whether individual metabolites and metabolomic profiles of dietary intake predict subsequent risk of development of knee OA, and whether diet-related metabolites and metabolomic profiles influence imaging biomarkers of knee OA. Finally, we will examine whether imaging biomarkers of knee OA mediate the associations of diet-related metabolomic profiles with risk of knee OA. This study will help to identify dietary factors associated with knee OA development, and offer the potential for effective OA prevention strategies; therefore, it may have large public health and clinical implications. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will assess whether individual diet-related metabolites and metabolomic profiles predict subsequent risk of knee OA, and examine how these metabolomic profiles influence imaging biomarkers of knee OA. Finally we will investigate whether the imaging biomarkers mediate the associations of metabolomic profiles with risk of knee OA.",Metabolites of Dietary Intake and Risk of Knee Osteoarthritis,10180902,R01AR074447,"['Ache', 'Adherence', 'Ancillary Study', 'Arthritis', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biomarker of Dietary Intake', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Fabaceae', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fishes', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lesion', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Nutritive Value', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Processed Meats', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Unsaturated Fats', 'base', 'cohort', 'dietary', 'disorder risk', 'effusion', 'epidemiology study', 'fruits and vegetables', 'good diet', 'imaging biomarker', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'nutrient metabolism', 'physically handicapped', 'prognostic', 'saturated fat', 'willingness']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,662673
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of the R01 (MH074457-14) which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). BrainMap is a neuroimaging research resource facilitating cognitive neuroscience and disease-biomarker discovery via coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). BrainMap provides its end-user community with: curated 3-D coordinate data and experimental metadata from peer-reviewed publications; extensively validated computational tools for CBMA; CBMA-derived tools for data interpretation (e.g., functional property and disease loadings by location) and data analysis (e.g., via CBMA-derived disease models); instructional materials and on-site and on-line venues for learning CBMA methods; and, on-going end-user support. At present, BrainMap.org hosts two coordinate-based databases: task-activation (TA DB) and voxel- based morphometry (VBM DB). A voxel-based physiology database (VBP DB) is in the planning and piloting phase. BrainMap maintains an integrated pipeline of cross-platform (Java) tools for data coding (Scribe), filtered retrieval (Sleuth), activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) CBMA (GingerALE), data visualization (Mango), and data interpretation (CBMA-derived Mango plugins). Multiple network-modeling approaches have been successfully applied to BrainMap data – independent components analysis (ICA), author-topic modeling (ATM), graph-theory modeling (GTM), structural equation modeling (SEM), connectivity-based parcellation (CBP), and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) – but none are yet optimized and “pipelined” for general use. Utilization of BrainMap resources is substantial: our software, data and meta-data have been used in >1,000 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, > 500 were published in the current funding cycle (2015- 2020). Four aims are proposed, to maintain and extend this high-impact research resource.  Aim 1. Voxel-based Physiology DataBase (VBP DB) with Analysis Exemplars. Aim 2. BrainMap Community Portal for Multivariate Modeling with Applications & Exemplars. Aim 3. Large-scale Parameter Estimations. Aim 4. BrainMap Pipeline Enhancements and Community Support. The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data.",Meta-analysis in human brain mapping,10157292,R01MH074457,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Brain Mapping', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational workshop', 'Equation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mango - dietary', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'case control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graph theory', 'hemodynamics', 'independent component analysis', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'morphometry', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'simulation', 'webinar']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2021,637306
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Accelerated Brain Aging in World Trade Center Responders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The men and women who worked in rescue and recovery operations at the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) site are developing cognitive impairment at mid-life, decades before age-based cognitive impairment is usually detected. To date, one of the most consistent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and impairment in this population include long-term exposures to the WTC disaster sites and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our preliminary analyses identified reduced cortical thickness in responders with dementia compared to cognitively unimpaired WTC responders. While this work has been valuable in advancing our understanding of cognitive impairment in WTC responders, it remains unknown to what extent reduced cortical thickness is indicative of a known disorder, and no studies to date have been able to reliably quantify the extent to which patterns evident on MRI match population norms. Our team has recently identified a highly sensitive biomarker for functional “brain age,” which we have shown to detect the first signs of deterioration as early as the late 40’s. Known as brain “network stability,” this measure replicates across multiple large-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and correlates with gradual cognitive decline. The difference between an individual’s predicted age based on MRI data (“brain age”) versus their chronological age provides a metric for accelerated brain aging. Therefore, a critical next step is to characterize WTC responders’ brain ages, both structurally (cortical thickness) and functionally (network stability), which may relate WTC trauma to observed cognitive impairment at mid-life. In the present work, we propose to complete secondary data analyses of a large-scale brain MRI training data set (UK Biobank, N=19,831) to train a deep learning model for neurobiological signatures of aging and its potential mechanisms. We will then compare neurobiological features seen in WTC responders to these signatures. In Aim 1, we measure accelerated brain aging for WTC responders with and without PTSD, using comparing brain aging to population norms, as well as to proteomic markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, including β-amyloid and tau. In Aim 2, we leverage our previous methods development in AI of neuroimaging data to develop neurobiological classifiers specific to key mechanisms of relevance to WTC: particulates, glucocorticoids, inflammation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, to determine whether AI classifies WTC brains as matching neurobiological signatures specific to one or more of these mechanisms. This study responds to a call for aging-related research proposals in WTC-affected individuals (RFA-OH-21-004) and will improve our understanding of accelerated neurobiological aging in an existing neuroimaging study of WTC responders. For the prevention of ADRD to be successful, reliable measures are needed for subclinical changes in accelerated brain aging that occur in midlife. This study seeks to implement a novel measure of brain age optimized to be sensitive to midlife neurological changes and combines it with AI to identify the mechanisms through which exposures may have affected WTC responders.

We propose to complete secondary data analyses of a large- scale brain MRI training data set (UK Biobank, N=19,831) to train a deep learning model for neurobiological signatures of aging and its potential mechanisms. We will then compare neurobiological features seen in WTC responders to these signatures.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Accelerated Brain Aging in World Trade Center Responders,10315319,R21AG074706,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'C-reactive protein', 'Chronic stress', 'Chronology', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Emotional Stress', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupations', 'Particulate', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Trade Center disaster', 'aging brain', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical anxiety', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'men', 'method development', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'operation', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'public health priorities', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'trauma centers']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2021,249999
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,10107769,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,163890
"Systemic contribution of age-associated epigenetic mechanisms to osteoarthritis PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States and a leading cause of physical disability in older individuals. There are no approved pharmacologic treatments available beyond those for symptomatic relief. Thus, identifying new treatment targets is critical to reducing the burden of OA. While age is one of the strongest predictors of OA, the disease mechanisms that underlie the relationship between cellular and molecular hallmarks of aging and OA are unclear. The long-term goal of this ancillary study is to identify potential new targets for OA therapy by identifying key age-associated biological mechanisms underlying OA pathogenesis. The objective of this project is to determine the role of epigenetic changes to genes in key aging pathways on OA. The central hypothesis is that aging is associated with epigenetic modifications affecting DNA methylation levels in immune blood cells (i.e., `inflammaging') and will be associated with greater burden of disease across commonly affected synovial joints, including the hands, knees and hips. Epigenetic modifications that affect downstream changes in gene and protein expression without altering the DNA sequence may provide important insights into OA pathogenesis that are not captured by information on genetic or environmental risk factors. The contribution of age-related epigenetic mechanisms to OA burden will be assessed in the MOST study, an ongoing well-characterized cohort of individuals with and without early stage knee OA. The pending reexamination of MOST subjects presents a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to obtain contemporaneous measures of epigenetic markers and OA burden that includes assessments of hand OA from radiographs. New acquisition of hand radiographs will be combined with the ongoing radiographic imaging of knees and hips to constitute a multiple joint OA phenotype. The acquisition of hand radiographs and genome-wide DNA methylation will make it possible for the first time in MOST to study the relation of epigenetic factors with multiple joint OA. Aims of the study include 1) determining whether epigenetic age acceleration is associated with multiple joint OA by assessing the difference between chronological age and epigenetic molecular age, then relating this to multiple joint OA and 2) identifying novel epigenetic markers associated with multiple joint OA by performing an epigenome-wide association study, then pathway analyses and hierarchical clustering to identify whether differentially methylated loci and OA subtypes are enriched for biological pathways related to aging. The expected outcome is identification of age-associated epigenetic mechanisms that underlie OA pathogenesis, which is needed to identify relevant OA treatment targets and biomarkers that could be used to identify at-risk individuals earlier in the disease process before the onset of structural changes in the joint. The proposed ancillary study will also provide valuable epigenetics data that will lay the groundwork for future integrative studies of genetics/genomics in the MOST parent study, greatly enhancing its scientific value to the medical community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States and represents a major public health burden to the aging population, leading to severe pain, structural joint damage, progressive loss of function and reduced quality of life. There are currently no approved pharmacologic treatments available beyond those for symptomatic relief.

"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of targeted interventions and therapies.",Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression,10208726,K01AR075879,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arthralgia', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatology', 'Right to Treatments', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'complex data', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,130950
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'high body mass index', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,651069
"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information. The NIS will accelerate itch research and improve quality of diagnosis and treatment of itch, which will eventually help the many people who suffer from chronic itch. Relevant statement Our proposal is the first project to develop a brain activity-based biomarker for itch. Success of our proposal will eventually allow us to share an objective itch assessment using the biomarker with research institutes, hospitals and industries across the world to accelerate itch research, and improve diagnosis and assessment of itch treatment.",Development of neurologic itch signature,10193704,R21AR078940,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antipruritics', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dermatologic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pruritus', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'chronic itch', 'cost', 'diagnosis quality', 'expectation', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurotransmission', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'phrases', 'primary endpoint', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,174695
"Impact of Cognitive function on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Project Narrative  Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A  significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a  neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)  including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical  need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including  preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity  associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also  provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.

"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,10206210,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mammary', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2021,443259
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10468485,R00HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2021,249000
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda Project Summary/Abstract Increased access to cesarean sections (c-sections) has contributed to the decline of maternal mortality in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA); however, as the rate of c-sections has increased, so has the rate of c-section related complications. While women who deliver vaginally in rural SSA often receive postpartum follow-up care in their homes from community health workers (CHWs), most programs require that women who deliver via c-section return to health centers or hospitals for follow-up because of the increased complexity of their care. Facility- based follow-up can be financially catastrophic and physically burdensome for mothers, leading to delays in care and increased risk for morbidity. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a safe mobile health (mHealth) tool to support CHW-led home- based follow-up for women delivering via c-section in rural Rwanda at postoperative days (PODs) 5 and 10. In the first R21 phase, we will develop a software library for an existing photo-based surgical site infection (SSI) diagnostic algorithm to run locally on a smartphone (without internet or cell network connection) (Aim 1a). We will work with Insightiv Technologies to develop the comprehensive mHealth-CHW tool, including incorporating the SSI diagnostic algorithm software library and integrating three CHW usability assessments into the design phase (Aim 1b). Finally, we will test the usability and acceptability of the new tool in a group of 30 CHWs (Aim 2). When we achieve 80% usability and acceptability, we will continue to the second phase. The R33 phase of the grant will study the validity of the mHealth-CHW tool for c-section follow-up (Aim 3) by prospectively following 450 women delivering via c-section and implementing the mHealth-CHW tool and follow- up in their homes at PODs 5 and 10. The women will then return to the hospital at POD 16 for a physical examination and we will compare diagnoses and complications identified via the mHealth-CHW tool to those from the physical exam. We will then evaluate the time-to-diagnosis for c-section complications by randomizing 1350 women to follow-up by the mHealth-CHW tool versus standard of care (Aim 4). Finally, we will assess the acceptability of mHealth-CHW follow-up in 40 women who have delivered via c-section through focus group discussions (Aim 5). We will also conduct two research training series, one in quantitative methods and one in qualitative methods, to strengthen our team's ability to lead mHealth research in the future. Project Narrative In this study, we will develop a comprehensive mHealth-community health worker (CHW) tool for cesarean section (c-section) follow-up that is usable and acceptable to CHWs in rural Rwanda. We will then assess the validity of this tool during a prospective pilot, the impact of this tool on time-to-diagnosis in a randomized trial, as well as the acceptability of the tool to mothers delivering via c-section. This research will support the ability of CHWs to provide safe, accessible, and affordable in-home c-section follow-up care to women in rural Africa, thus decreasing the physical and financial burden of facility-based follow-up for new mothers.",mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda,10268606,R21HD103052,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cesarean section', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Home', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Postpartum Period', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Rwanda', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vagina', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation fidelity', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'postcesarean section', 'postpartum care', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2021,5000
"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our data were retrospectively collected partially funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and two other foundational/institutional grant (2016-2020); our data is comprehensive (clinical data from mothers and neonates, neonatal brain MRI with expert-consensus annotations of HIE lesions, and complete set of outcome measures by 2 years of age); our data is representative (MRI scanner, age at MRI, MRI protocol, patient outcomes, patient racial/ethnicity groups); and our data is multi-site (2 hospitals) and large-scale (N=231 compared to proprietary studies with dozens of patients).

"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,10236498,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,192564
"ENIGMA Parkinson’s Initiative: A Global Initiative for Parkinson’s Disease ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative brain disease, with no known cure. The disease afflicts 10 million people worldwide - ~1.5 million in the U.S. alone, and ~50k-60k new cases are diagnosed annually. Risk factors or interventions are extremely hard to evaluate as we lack objective metrics of how PD affects the brain. The vast global availability of brain imaging has led to several promising metrics to gauge PD progression in the brain - structural changes in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, abnormalities in neural connectivity seen with diffusion MRI (dMRI), and disruptions of the brain’s functional synchrony across regions, seen with resting state functional MRI (fMRI). Despite these findings, factors that affect disease severity are difficult to discover, as most imaging studies of PD scan <100 patients. Most PD research is conducted in isolated cohorts from the US and Europe, limiting worldwide generalizability. Factors that affect PD progression are hard to verify, leading to a crisis of reproducibility. Responding to NIH’s call for more reproducible studies, here we launch ENIGMA’s Worldwide Parkinson’s Initiative. ENIGMA recently published the largest neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. With ENIGMA’s globally coordinated, highly powered consortium approach, we plan to overcome the crisis of small studies with poor power and reproducibility. Pooling anatomic, diffusion and resting state functional MRI metrics from 21 deeply assessed international cohorts - from the US, Brazil, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, South Africa, China, and Russia - we ask: How does the illness affect the brain's structure, neural connectivity, and functional synchrony? What imaging biomarkers track disease progression and consistently predict clinical outcomes? Do genetic risk loci for PD help predict brain decline? What PD subtypes, or clusters, can imaging identify? Combining multimodal data from 2,307 patients and 1,264 controls, we will thoroughly evaluate predictors and brain biomarkers in PD. Our aims are to: (1) Evaluate and rank structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI biomarkers of PD worldwide; (2) Evaluate the added value of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in predicting PD brain biomarkers; (3) Predict future functional decline in PD with machine learning, multi-modal imaging and genomics. We will use genetic data and baseline clinical variables from PD patients and healthy controls across our cohorts to construct an ensemble of models to predict the annual rate of change in combined scores from the Movement Disorder Society—Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III. We will rank the best predictors of decline, and assess how robust they are internationally. By better modeling variance in patient outcomes, our multimodal predictive model will empower PD clinical trials by ranking biomarkers of disease burden and determining the contexts where they are reliable, accurate, and feasible to use. NARRATIVE Over 10 million people worldwide live with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) - the world’s second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease: PD’s economic cost is ~$14.4 billion in the U.S. alone. Here we launch ENIGMA’s Worldwide Parkinson’s Initiative - the largest and most highly-powered neuroimaging investigation of PD - pooling data from 21 cohorts from North America (US), South America (Brazil), Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, UK), Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan), Africa (South Africa) and Oceania (New Zealand). Using global data to offer unprecedented power, we will identify genomic, interventional, and environmental factors that consistently impact disease severity and progression, supporting the development of personalized treatments.",ENIGMA Parkinson’s Initiative: A Global Initiative for Parkinson’s Disease,10209632,R01NS107513,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Age of Onset', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Atrophic', 'Attenuated', 'Austria', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Belgium', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brazil', 'China', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Europe', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Netherlands', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New Zealand', 'North America', 'Oceania', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Russia', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South America', 'Structure', 'Structure of inferior temporal gyrus', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Switzerland', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biobank', 'biological sex', 'burden of illness', 'cholinergic', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'functional decline', 'genetic risk factor', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'putamen', 'rate of change', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'thalamocortical tract', 'treatment response', 'uptake', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,675998
"Neurobiological Markers as Predictors of Later Functional Outcome in First Episode Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the parent R01 project experienced significant delays and interruptions in the last year of award, resulting in substantial components (Aim 2) of the investment being at risk. Also, the principal investigator’s grants are ending with no additional funding. This supplement will thus provide a critical resource to: i) complete the proposed longitudinal cohort data collection in order to achieve the proposed project goals; ii) extend the science of parent R01 project beyond the initial follow-up period to include the early-stage illness period; iii) provide much needed salary support of the principal investigator. NIMH priority research area: Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan. Scope of the Parent Project (MH109687): to characterize bio-classes of first episode of psychosis patients (FEP) using an expanded biomarker panel and to investigate the role of bio-classes as predictors of later functional outcomes. Specific Aim 1: To bio-classify FEP patients into distinct homogeneous sub-groups (bio-classes) using a constellation of biomarkers and phenotypes at baseline. Specific Aim 2a: To investigate whether baseline bio-classes are associated with and predictive of later functional outcomes over a two-year follow-up period and collect comprehensive biomarker, clinical, and functional outcome measures at each time point. Specific Aim 2b: To examine differences between bio-classes and DSM classification in associations with later functional outcomes and recovery trajectories over two-years. Contribution of the requested supplement: Although the 2-year follow-up data was not collected due to the COVID-19 disruption, we predict that baseline bio-classes will continue to be significantly associated with and predictive of later functional outcomes throughout the early-stage illness beyond the initial proposed 2 years. Therefore, we propose a Modified Specific Aim 2a: To investigate whether baseline bio-classes are associated with and predictive of later functional outcomes during early-stage illness. We will bring back FEP patients (N=58) who have already enrolled in the study with baseline data and collect follow-up data. The follow-up period will thus be extended within 4 years of illness onset. We predict that machine learning clustering analyses will parse out heterogeneity of patients making reliable bio-class classifications and predictions. Specific Aim 2b will remain unchanged. PROJECT NARRATIVE This Administrative Supplement (NOT-MH-21-120) will provide a critical resource to allow data collection of the parent R01 project to be completed in order to achieve the proposed goals, aiming to explore dense biomarkers and behavioral indicators for identifying individuals who are at risk of worsening outcome trajectory at the earliest possible point.",Neurobiological Markers as Predictors of Later Functional Outcome in First Episode Psychosis,10376420,R01MH109687,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Career Mobility', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Investments', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Mental disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychoses', 'Publishing', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Wages', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'brain volume', 'career', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'neuroimaging', 'pandemic disease', 'parent project', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,374861
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,10231183,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Prognosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,236443
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,10239047,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,178096
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,10213601,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,186147
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"Inter-modal Coupling Image Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop statistical methods for the analysis of the local covariance structure between measurements in multimodal biomedical imaging studies. Despite the rise of multi-modal imaging studies and the proliferation of derived measures available from each modality, very little work has explored relationships between modalities. Notably, brain structure and function evolve dramatically in the context of adolescent brain development, but typical analyses usually evaluate each imaging phenotype separately. We propose to develop tools for measuring relationships between brain imaging phenotypes provided by disparate imaging modalities. Covariance structures at the subject level will allow identification of local relationships between measures, through weighted regressions and singular value decomposition-based techniques. These techniques will be extended to accommodate any number of imaging modalities and incorporate repeated measures. We will use extensive test-retest data provided by the Consortium of Reproducibility and Reliability (CORR) for validation, and to identify coupling measures that are particularly reliable. The rich multi-modal imaging data and associated clinical phenotypes from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) will allow us to delineate how inter- modal coupling evolves in normal brain development, and also establish how such relationships are altered in association with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. This proposal builds upon established collaboration between the PIs and capitalizes on their complimentary expertise in imaging statistics, developmental neuroimaging, psychopathology, and intimate familiarity with the PNC dataset. Upon completion, this project will provide powerful new tools for the neuroscience community, as well as novel insights regarding brain development and early psychosis-spectrum symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop new tools for integrative analysis of local relationships among brain imaging measures. Despite the rise of multi-modal imaging studies and the proliferation of derived measures available from each modality, very little work has explored relationships between modalities. The methods developed as part of this proposal will fill this critical gap in the field, and will lead to more sensitive and specific biomarkers of brain pathology and healthy development.",Inter-modal Coupling Image Analytics,10126060,R01MH112847,"['Adolescence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Familiarity', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain health', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'dimensional analysis', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,443685
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,10075321,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,816340
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,10241351,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,160963
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,10129768,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,377498
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10227044,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2021,35546
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects. This study will identify risk-factors for developing troublesome hoarding by integrating and analyzing clinical interviews and a web-based registry of adults that includes various medical and cognitive questionnaires and neurocognitive tests.",Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding,10253596,R01MH117114,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain Health Registry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive Hoarding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Impairment', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computing resources', 'disability', 'frailty', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'recruit', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,68363
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large.",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,10227979,R00MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing', 'supervised learning']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,237045
"Metabolic correlates of disease activity and disability progression in pediatric MS PROJECT SUMMARY The biological processes contributing to relapses and disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) remain largely unknown. During the past decade, our pediatric MS Network has investigated risk factors in children. We have discovered that higher saturated fat and lower vegetable dietary intake may independently increase the risk of relapse in those with the disease. Our preliminary findings, consistent with the association of high fat diet with higher risk of MS relapse, suggest that higher plasma levels of three acyl-ethanolamides (endocannabinoids) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be associated with higher relapse risk in children. Lipids mediators such as oxylipins and endocannabinoids have immunomodulatory properties and some are neuroprotective. Their plasma levels are influenced among others by dietary intake, obesity status and genetic profile. Furthermore, our findings that the tryptophan pathway is associated with the risk of relapse and disease progression links plausibly to expected changes in short chain fatty acids that we plan to investigate. Although MS is less common in children, studies in this age group have several important advantages including less irrelevant exposures and comorbidities that result from aging. With previous NIH and National MS Society support, we have established a highly collaborative national research group and a unique resource that will be leveraged in this proposal to test new hypotheses. We propose state-of-the-art untargeted and targeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses to determine the association of various plasma and stool lipids and their mediators with the risk of subsequent relapse, new MRI lesions, and neurologic and cognitive impairment. Each individual has extensive demographic, clinical, MRI, genetic, food frequency and environmental exposure data. Analyses will be adjusted for possible confounders such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic profile, use of disease-modifying therapy, body mass index and serum 25(OH) vitamin D. We will also model the contribution of various metabolites in the context of adipokines, food frequency, gut microbiome profile and genetic variants that modulate plasma lipid and mediator levels. This sophisticated modelling including pathway analyses will establish which of the variables are independent predictors. Our group of collaborators with expertise in metabolomics, lipidomics, genetics, and environmental risk factors is in a unique position to significantly advance the understanding of MS pathogenesis. The findings in the proposed study will unravel biological links between diet, gut microbiome, obesity and MS course. Although longitudinal association studies do not confirm causality, they are critical to identify putative biological pathways that may contribute to disease activity and progression. Intervention studies cannot be designed if associations are unknown. Our proposed investigation has strong potential for clinical translation as we will identify biological targets that can then be tested for causality in proof-of-concept MS trials with interventions such as supplementation with live biotherapeutic products influencing metabolic pathways of interest. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our pediatric MS Network has recently discovered that diet may influence MS course: higher fat and lower vegetable intake correlate with higher risk of relapse. Our preliminary findings suggest that three degradation products from fats measured in the blood and known to increase inflammation increase the risk of MS relapses. In the proposed study, we will identify which blood and stool fats, alone or in combination, correlate with MS relapse and disability progression.",Metabolic correlates of disease activity and disability progression in pediatric MS,10210165,R01NS117541,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary intake', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fermentation', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'High Fat Diet', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Propionates', 'Race', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Societies', 'Supplementation', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Metabolism Pathway', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetables', 'Vitamin D', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'adipokines', 'age group', 'biobank', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive disability', 'comorbidity', 'data reduction', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'forest', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'lipid mediator', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'pediatric patients', 'physically handicapped', 'relapse risk', 'saturated fat', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'stool sample', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,422773
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,10092219,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,33126
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'schizophrenia risk', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138
"Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester). We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping. These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the development of next-generation techniques. Project narrative: This project will study organizational principles of brain pathways with a combination of chemical tracing and diffusion MRI. The ultimate goal is to assess and improve the accuracy of diffusion MRI, which is currently the only technique for imaging these pathways non-invasively and studying their role in the healthy and diseased brain in vivo. The unique dataset collected by this project will provide a testbed that can aid the neuroimaging research community in identifying shortcomings of current diffusion MRI analysis techniques and provide guidance towards seeking alternative approaches that overcome these shortcomings.",Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures,10099935,R01NS119911,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Macaca', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anatomical tracing', 'automated algorithm', 'brain pathway', 'cingulate cortex', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontal lobe', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tractography']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,666884
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States.

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority.

"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10162387,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoses', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,759049
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,10175049,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,675778
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain CircuitsPD Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology).

"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022.

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults.

"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10225618,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preventive intervention', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'social', 'substance use', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,162963
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychoses', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'substance use', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment after Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are now recognized as a key pathogenic factor in dementia, and represent a promising target for intervention. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. However, the impact of APOs on maternal VCID remains unexamined. Most existing women's cardiovascular and aging cohorts lack rigorously phenotyped, prospectively collected pregnancy data, and the impact of maternal factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID is not well understood. From 2010-2013, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study enrolled a diverse cohort of 10,037 healthy women at 8 US academic medical centers, who were followed from early in conception through the delivery of their first child. Several years later, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) brought back 4,475 nuMoM2b women for a second study wave, to characterize subsequent pregnancy outcomes and accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors following pregnancy. A third study wave of in-person visits will begin in early 2022. In this ancillary study, we propose to conduct neurocognitive assessments on all nuMoM2b-HHS participants during this third study wave. We will perform brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a sub-cohort of 250 women followed at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center study site, including all who experienced APOs in the index pregnancy. The overall goal of the study is to capitalize on this unique obstetric cohort to determine the impact of APOs on long term maternal VCID, through the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the impact of APOs on maternal cognition 10-15 years after delivery by comparing global cognition scores between women who experienced APOs and women who did not; (2) Determine the impact of APOs on MRI biomarkers of maternal VCID, including white matter hyperintensity volume and additional markers of cerebral small vessel disease. We hypothesize that the association of APOs with VCID markers will be partially mediated by development of new hypertension after the index pregnancy. As an exploratory aim, we will use deep pregnancy phenotyping, including maternal characteristics, biomarkers of ischemic placental disease and APOs, to create a VCID prediction model. This will be the first US study to use prospectively collected pregnancy data to investigate the impact of APOs, a sex-specific vascular risk factor, on VCID in women. Understanding the effects of APOs on early markers of VCID could help us identify women early in life who are at higher risk of dementia, and develop preventive strategies to thwart the progression of cognitive decline in this population. In addition, the collection of neurocognitive assessments on the entire nuMoM2b-HHS cohort during this study wave is an important investment, which will provide baseline data for future studies as these women continue to age. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cerebrovascular risk; however, the impact of APOs on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) in women remains unexamined, and the effects of factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID are not well understood.

"Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability PROJECT SUMMARY Affective lability (AL) is a common psychiatric symptom characterized by rapid mood fluctuations. Clinically significant AL often begins in adolescence, is present in both psychiatric disorders and the general population, and is a major risk factor for suicide. However, the developmental substrates of AL remain only sparsely described. Prior studies have implicated deficits of top-down regulation between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the amygdala; the FPN is also known to undergo protracted maturation into young adulthood. However, previous efforts have been limited by methodological obstacles related to underlying biological heterogeneity of the FPN. Cortical networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a 1:1 mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, recent studies using precision functional mapping techniques have demonstrated reliable individual differences in functional topography, i.e., the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. Notably, the FPN is both critical for affect regulation and also has the most variable functional topography of any cortical network. This proposal will capitalize upon new machine learning tools to map the FPN on a personalized basis to test the over-arching hypothesis that AL is associated with developmental abnormalities of FPN topography and connectivity. In Aim 1, we will continue to acquire a sample of 30 adolescents and young adults (ages 16-21) with affective lability and 20 matched comparators using smartphone-based digital phenotyping and multi- modal imaging. In Aim 2, we will capitalize upon a recently-completed longitudinal study (n=200, 10-25 years old, mean follow up interval = 5 years) that will allow us to understand how longitudinal changes in personalized FPN topography and connectivity associate with AL. Taken together, this project will provide valuable new insights regarding circuit-level developmental deficits associated with AL, and provide the candidate with superb training in computational psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Affective lability is a common symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions in youth and is one of the strongest predictors of suicide. Here, we propose to use machine learning tools to identify circuit-level deficits associated with affective lability in individual adolescents and young adults. This knowledge may be critical for the development of personalized therapeutics for the treatment of affective lability.",Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability,10140765,F31MH123063,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological heterogeneity', 'burden of illness', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'common symptom', 'digital', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning Abstract This application will combine the strengths of two large scale NIH-funded initiatives to understand disorder- related patterns in the human brain: Connectomes Related to Human Disease (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA). We will develop and evaluate novel brain vulnerability metrics - based on the idea of polygenic risk scores – that we expect to better predict diagnosis and cognitive performance than standard neuroimaging measures. We define a metric of “vulnerability” by quantifying the similarity between each individual's brain pattern and deficit patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) uses Big Data meta-analyses to quantify the similarity between an individual and meta-analytical deficit effect size patterns based on large and diverse international samples. The Machine Learning-Vulnerability Index (MVI) is trained using Big Data mega-analytic samples to quantify the similarity for individual brain patterns to those learned from patients and controls. We will compute novel, cross-domain vulnerability metrics to phenotype each of the N=3,350 CHRD individuals across three mainly psychiatric (schizophrenia-spectrum and psychosis disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder), three mainly neurological (epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) and three neuroimaging domains (structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI). Our Specific Aims merge CRHD and ENIGMA data to test four hypotheses: 1) Neuropsychiatric illnesses not only impact an isolated region or circuit, but are associated with deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that can be unique to each illness; 2) such deficit patterns are informative of cognitive deficits in patients; 3) similarity with the deficit patterns will have higher specificity and sensitivity than any traditional neuroimaging metric or trait; and 4) similarity at the voxel- and vertex-based level may lead to development of high-resolution vulnerability indices. We will test these hypotheses by performing patient-control sensitivity and specificity analyses in the corresponding CRHD illness groups; study the degree of separation vs. commonality across psychiatric and neurological disorders; and evaluate pattern differences at specific stages of the illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. We will use multivariate mediation analyses to link vulnerability to variance in cognitive domains ascertained by CHRD. This short, intensive project will benefit the community-at-large by populating the CHRD/HCP database with novel multimodal brain phenotypes extracted and homogenized using standard ENIGMA workflows, enriched with Open Science approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE The Connectomes Related to Human Disease/Human Connectome Project (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) are two large scale NIH-funded initiatives exploring disorder-related patterns in the human brain. The two projects are complementary: CRHD focuses on in-depth, high-resolution multimodal phenotyping of the brain connectome in modest samples, whereas ENIGMA's analyses harness the statistical power of large and inclusive, worldwide samples. We propose combining the strengths of CRHD and ENIGMA to test novel biomarkers based on replicable and consistent illness deficit patterns provided by Big Data studies. We posit that major brain illnesses do not impact an isolated region or brain circuit but rather lead to deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that are shared or unique to an illness; such deficit patterns are highly replicable and linked to severity, duration and treatment resistance. We will develop and evaluate a multivariate vulnerability model based on (1) the degree of similarity between an individual's brain patterns and expected disorder patterns defined as a linear combination of deficits - conceptually similar to polygenic risk scores - and (2) a vulnerability metric computed using machine learning. We will test the specificity and sensitivity of these models against the single most discriminative neuroimaging traits in six diagnostic categories shared by CRHD and ENIGMA: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and psychosis, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorders (BP), epilepsy (EP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will use multivariate analyses to compare sensitivity and specificity of the regional vulnerability index (RVI) and machine learning vulnerability (MVI) in separating patients and controls in the CHRD samples, mapping unique and shared deficit patterns across six diagnostic categories. We will link vulnerability metrics to cognitive outcomes and diagnosis using mediation analyses. Finally, we will enrich vulnerability models with CHRD's connectomics based phenotypes including cortical myelination to advance white matter integrity measurements for future large-scale ENIGMA studies.",Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning,10186960,RF1MH123163,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heritability', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychoses', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'schizophrenia-spectrum disorder', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,RF1,2021,1220179
"Secondary analysis of functional MRI and resting state connectivity in white matter Abstract / Summary This proposal aims to perform novel, secondary analyses on large archives of publicly-available fMRI studies in order to quantify the functional characteristics of white matter (WM) and their changes during normal aging and in the progression to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effects have been used to detect neural activity in grey matter (GM) for many years, but BOLD signals in WM have traditionally been ignored so they have not been considered in previous analyses. However, WM BOLD signals have been evaluated in relatively small numbers of healthy brains, and these studies have shown that WM shows robust, tract-specific BOLD changes in response to stimuli, WM exhibits inter-regional correlations in a resting state similar to those used to infer functional connectivity in cortex, and signal fluctuations within WM tracts in a resting state show strong correlations to specific GM cortical volumes engaged together in functional networks. We therefore propose to adapt the tools developed for analyzing GM connectivity and for diffusion imaging of WM to analyze the functional changes in WM with age in >7,900 imaging studies available publicly. In Aim 1, we will detect and characterize changes in WM functional networks with normal aging by analyzing subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Neuroimaging studies of AD suggest that WM abnormalities exist at a preclinical stage of the disease, so detecting and quantifying altered WM function may be an important metric of functional changes in this disorder. In Aim 2 therefore we will measure alterations in WM functional networks in subjects enrolled in the ADNI, BLSA, and OASIS-3 databases. In both Aims we will also measure co-variations of WM connectivities with behavioral, clinical and genetic assessments to establish how WM functional metrics reflect behavior and cognition and change with increasing cognitive impairment. In Aim 3 we will extend the creation of atlases and machine learning from current studies of diffusion MRI to quantifying WM functional MRI by creating age-adjusted atlases of WM functional MRI properties to enable normative comparisons and provide canonical templates for both functional and structural connectivity network analyses. We will also apply data-driven deep learning to identify individual signatures of impairment on a whole-brain basis. A failure of white matter functional integrity is clearly implicated in aging and neurodegeneration. This proposal will develop new understandings of the functional changes in WM across the lifespan, identify pathological changes in WM function with AD, and create new data-driven tools for interpretation of WM fMRI. NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to re-analyze large numbers of magnetic resonance imaging studies that are publicly available by focusing on signal variations in white matter that reflect neural activity and brain function but which have been excluded from previous analyses. We will quantify the relationships between white matter regional signal variations and their associations with cortical activity and other metrics of behavior and cognition in normally aging populations as well as during the progression of cognitive impairments characteristic of Alzheimer’s Disease. These studies will increase our understanding of the role of white matter in normal brain function and identify biomarkers of degenerative white matter changes.",Secondary analysis of functional MRI and resting state connectivity in white matter,10190338,RF1MH123201,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Baltimore', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'analytical tool', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive change', 'deep learning', 'gray matter', 'imaging study', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RF1,2021,1320938
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using various study designs, but the statistical methodology necessary for harmonizing these data for integrated analyses is currently lacking. In this project, we propose to develop, implement, and apply next-generation imaging harmonization methods for data acquired longitudinally or from more complex study designs, as well as appropriate harmonization methods for use in conjunction with popular multivariate pattern analysis techniques.",Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs,10188649,R01MH123550,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Advocate', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dwarfism', 'Federal Government', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cognitive development', 'combat', 'complex data', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'stem', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,603870
"Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients Project Summary Primary characteristics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include persistent fears and excessive maladaptive avoidance behaviors. Preclinical models of PTSD have heavily investigated the brain mechanisms of fear inhibition and active avoidance learning. Significant progress has been made in translating fear conditioning and extinction data into the human brain and their implications have helped further our understanding of PTSD psychopathology. The mechanisms of active avoidance, however, have scarcely been examined in the human brain, especially within the context of maladaptive responses as in the case of PTSD. The studies proposed in this application are designed to begin to fill this scientific gap. We will use a novel conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP) to examine the neural correlates of active avoidance and fear extinction learning and explore how extinction modulates active avoidance responses in participants with and without a PTSD diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PTSD psychopathology involves dysfunctional limbic-frontal activity including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and amygdala. Studies of avoidance in rodents and a few fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the vmPFC and striatum mediate threat response by toggling the expression of fear vs. avoidance responses. Participants (healthy controls with trauma exposure, and patients diagnosed with PTSD) will undergo the novel (validated) two- day CAAP. On day 1, participants will undergo Pavlovian fear conditioning, immediately followed by an active avoidance conditioning phase. Avoidance is achieved by pressing a button to prevent a shock from occurring but will not terminate the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlovian fear extinction learning (button removed; no avoidance possible) will follow. On day 2, recall of extinction learning will be tested. Before the start of the recall test, participants will receive a small monetary endowment and will be told that this money could be used to pay for shock avoidance during the recall test. The first aim is to Identify neural correlates of active avoidance. The second aim is to study activations after the CS+ terminates that index the relief from the avoided shock. The third aim is to examine neural correlates of extinction-to-avoidance transfer. The proposed studies are expected to provide a more integrated mechanistic understanding of the psychopathology of PTSD and reduce the gap between the rodent literature and human neuroimaging in avoidance research. Project Narrative The experiments proposed aim to examine the neural mechanisms of active avoidance learning and explore how these mechanisms are modulated by fear extinction learning circuits. We will use a novel conditioning and avoidance paradigm to gather functional MRI and subjective reports data from healthy controls and from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The anticipated impact is to enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive avoidance responses, reduce the translation gap in this area between rodents and human studies, and explore potential novel targets for advancing the treatment of PTSD.",Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients,10211625,R01MH123736,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Endowment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'learning extinction', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'trauma exposure', 'willingness to pay']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,756037
"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Rescuing Missed Longitudinal MRI visits in the UNC Early Brain Development Studies Database PROJECT ABSTRACT  In our ongoing R01 (MH123747-01A1) “The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk”) project, we aim to characterize the portion of individual differences in brain structure in the early adolescent brain is already present in the earlier years of life. Early adolescence and puberty is a major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study (EBDS) is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we are following these children at 12, 14, and 16 years of age via MRI, cognitive and behavioral assessments, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. One particular aim is to investigate the use of machine learning (ML) for the predictive analysis of early brain development to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Yet, most machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to longitudinal data do not perform well (or at all) when data points are missing, as ML methods need both complete data and large sample sizes. As longitudinal studies suffer commonly from significant missing data at different time points due to acquisition failure as well as participant attrition, even a rich database like the UNC EBDS is reduced to a significantly lower sample size by selecting only complete datasets to apply predictive ML (less than a third of the datasets of EBDS data from age 1 – 10 years is complete).  Here, we propose to rescue missing EBDS timepoints (at ages 1 - 10 yrs) of structural MR image data via multi-modal, multi-timepoints image predictions. This image data imputation includes cross-modality image generation (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at the same time), where available, as well as multi-timepoints imputation of longitudinal data (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at different time points). We will then apply our out-of-distribution model to provide additional information on the appropriateness of the imputed data. Subsequently, the same image processing that was applied to the original EBDS MRI data will be applied to the imputed/generated MRI data to compute missing information of morphometric measures (regional volumes, cortical thickness, surface area, and white matter fiber tract properties). This imputed data will be a highly significant resource for longitudinal ML/AI studies of brain development performed on the EBDS dataset, as it would allow for an increase in training data of over 200%. The original MR images, the imputed MR images, and the morphometric measures will all be shared via NDA, alongside the trained imputation network for use by others. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Studies of brain development suffer commonly from missing data due to acquisition failure as well as participant attrition. This missing data severely impact machine learning algorithms as they need both complete data and large sample sizes. Here, we will rescue missing data via advanced image data generation for the UNC Early Brain Development Study so that machine learning algorithms can be applied to study how early brain development predicts cognition and behavior later in adolescence, as well as risk for psychiatric disorders.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10412438,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '16 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Puberty', 'Readiness', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'postnatal period', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prenatal', 'repository', 'visual processing', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,286650
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10223137,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,445292
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,10237892,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'risk prediction', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'socioenvironmental factor', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,714526
"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10250553,R01MH124106,"['11 year old', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychopathology', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biological sex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,660324
"Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to develop sex-specific resting state fMRI biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) and to determine their underlying genetic correlates. Our primary aim is to determine the locations and the degree of sex-specific functional connectivity differences associated with MDD patients as compared to healthy subjects, and to test whether those sex-specific connectivity differences define sex-specific subtypes of MDD. The benefit of achieving these goals will be twofold: (1) in the clinic, achieving these goals will allow for more accurate diagnostic and treatment-response predictive algorithms for MDD, to reduce time to remission in MDD patients. (2) In the laboratory, our work will guide discovery of novel sex-specific circuit mechanisms and treatments for MDD. Our second aim is to determine if sex-specific MDD effects on connectivity can be predicted by regional gene expression in the brain. Investigating the relationship between brain gene expression and MDD effects on functional connectivity would implicate novel genes in the circuit mechanism of MDD and identify genes that interact with sex in driving MDD symptomatology. To achieve these aims, we will use parametric and non-parametric statistical testing to define sex-specific functional connectivity differences between depressed and healthy men, and between depressed and healthy women. Secondary analyses will test whether sex-specific classifiers for differentiating MDD subjects and healthy controls (“diagnostic biomarkers”) outperform classifiers trained on all subjects independent of sex. To identify genetic correlates of sex-specific MDD effects on functional connectivity, we will use the multivariate technique of partial least squares regression to locate linear combinations of genes which can predict MDD-related connectivity differences in males and in females. Finally, to identify sex-specific subtypes of MDD, we will use a combination of regularized canonical correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering in a validated method for subtype discovery previously published in Dr. Conor Liston’s lab. This project will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge of sex differences in MDD functional connectivity and the underlying genetic correlates of those differences. This project will also involve the execution of a concrete training plan to allow me to develop concrete technical skills in fMRI analysis and machine learning techniques, conceptual skill in hypothesis testing, data interpretation, and scientific communication, and clinical competency as a licensed physician, all under the guidance and mentorship of the project’s sponsor Dr. Liston and co-sponsor Dr. Francis Lee, who are both accomplished physician-scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been cited as the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 14.2 million patients in the United States per year, and contributing to over 47,000 suicides per year. Most patients experience a delay in reaching remission due to a lack of precise treatment selection methods. Our goal is to apply a biomarker-driven approach of precision medicine in psychiatry, using machine learning tools to analyze human neuroimaging and genetic data, with the clinical endpoint of shortened time to remission for MDD patients.",Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder,10235389,F30MH124317,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Syndrome', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnostics', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'comorbidity', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'guided inquiry', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'regional difference', 'risk variant', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skills', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F30,2021,48868
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. To improve clinically relevant predictive models, several issues need to be addressed: 1) to focus on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) to take into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) to integrate data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms. To address these challenges, the Accelerated Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP SCZ) study will collect diverse multi-modal data via two research networks (PRESCIENT and ProNET – 42 acquisition sites) in conjunction with the Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center (PREDICT-DPACC). The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials and lead to effective new treatments. The PREDICT-DPACC is tasked with, 1) providing collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for the two research networks; and 2) developing and applying advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, in addition to stratifying CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories. The PREDICT-DPACC team will include multiple data types and will address the needs of the CHR research networks and the overall AMP SCZ goals. Data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Planned analysis methods will be powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. This supplement will allow the PREDICT-DPACC team to address unexpected personnel effort needs to meet the goals set forth in the original grant submission, including, but not limited to, 1) two networks with separate and independent data capture systems that need separate development of software tools to aggregate data, which involves twice the effort to install, test, and deploy tools on their infrastructure for each network; 2) coordination with both networks to ensure that the forms and data dictionaries match across networks and with the NIMH National Data Archive; 3) the study dashboard needs to be customized further to meet the visualization needs of both networks; 4) the inclusion of additional healthy controls, and co-enrollment requirements also deviate from what was expected and complicates the proposed analytic approaches; 5) there is also participation in additional unexpected organizational activities such as team workgroups, which will continue and are needed to harmonize ideas, methods, and approaches to meet AMP SCZ goals. The supplement will fill in gaps that could not have been anticipated at the start of this study and will allow us to meet the scientific goals which have not changed. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, both the clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, we will work with NIMH staff, and key stakeholders, including private- public partners and the research networks, to harmonize, aggregate, guide, and coordinate the collection of new data across the two research networks (n=42 sites worldwide), in order to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes and lead to drug development and treatment tailored to more homogeneous CHR subjects. The supplement will allow us to meet unanticipated increased effort of personnel needed to meet the goals set forth in original grant submission, including, but not limited to, supporting the inclusion of two independent research networks and increased coordination between networks.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10457174,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychoses', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Travel', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'dashboard', 'data archive', 'data de-identification', 'data dictionary', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'web based interface', 'web site']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2021,777372
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10261581,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'preventive intervention', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,420000
"Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Abstract In the ﬁrst years of life, the human brain develops dynamically in both structure and function. Many neurodevel- opmental disorders are associated with aberrations from normative growth during this critical period of early brain development. The increasing availability of longitudinal baby MRI data, such as those acquired through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), affords unprecedented opportunity for precise charting of early brain developmental trajectories in order to understand normative and aberrant growth. Dedicated computational tools are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heterogeneous changes across time. The goal of this project is to equip brain researchers with computational tools effective for studying the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter pathways using diffusion MRI. We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools for effective estimation of white matter pathways in the baby brain via diffusion tractography. We will tackle the challenge of tracking through regions with low diffusion anisotropy owing to ongoing myelination in the developing brain. Our tools will allow proper characterization of complex white matter pathway patterns such as fanning and bending. This will allow solving the gyral bias problem ubiquitous in existing tractography algorithms with ﬁber streamlines terminating predomi- nantly at gyral crowns but not sulcal banks. Our tools will allow tracing of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways with more uniform coverage of the cortex. In Aim 2, we will develop microstructural analysis meth- ods that are unconfounded by complex ﬁber conﬁgurations, such as crossing, bending, branching, kissing, and fanning, allowing more accurate and speciﬁc characterization of changes in tissue microarchitecture during early brain development. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow diffusion MRI data collected at multiple sites, which are very common in the era of big data, to be harmonized to mitigate the negative effects of inter-site variability. Unlike existing methods that harmonize derived quantities such as fractional anisotropy, our method can be applied directly to the diffusion-weighted images, allowing measurements based on microstructure and connectivity to be subsequently computed for consistent analysis. We will also develop deep learning tools for multi-shell data prediction so that diffusion MRI data collected with different numbers of shells can be harmonized. Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools to better chart the normative early development of the human brain using diffusion MRI. The developed tools will also enable quantitative brain examinations of children who are affected by neurological developmental disorders. Project Narrative This project will empower neuroscience researchers with robust computational tools needed to study the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter connection pathways using diffusion MRI. We will develop tools to tackle challenges speciﬁc to analyzing infant diffusion MRI data, including (i) com- plex microstructure arising from the interweaving of differentially oriented neurites (axons and dendrites) in the context of the extracellular matrix; and (ii) complex white matter ﬁber geometries, such as crossing, bending, and fanning. We will also create tools to cater to the big-data era need of dealing with data from multiple imaging sites with potential discrepancies in acquisition protocols and scanner behaviors, allowing intra- and inter-site variability to be reduced via data harmonization for consistent analysis with signiﬁcantly boosted statistical power.",Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development,10317389,R01MH125479,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Dental crowns', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Felis catus', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'North Carolina', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'myelination', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,456443
"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease,10121764,R01DK125561,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Coin', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Endoscopy', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Fever', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhagic colitis', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiration', 'Safety', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell motility', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diffusion weighted', 'economic impact', 'efficacy evaluation', 'healing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'water diffusion']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,391320
"Removing and Manipulating Emotional Information in Working Memory: Cognitive and Neural Representations PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of the current project is to understand how emotional thoughts can be removed from one's mind. Most psychiatric disorders are characterized by an inability to remove negative, intrusive, and maladaptive thoughts from mind. Previously examining whether an individual has purged a thought from mind has relied mainly on self-report measures (e.g., “Yes, I stopped thinking about the car crash”). In the proposed research, the research team will use a combination of brain imaging approaches with machine learning techniques drawn from computer science to provide an objective neural marker of whether indeed a thought has been removed from mind. This approach builds on proven success with this technique pioneered by the research team. This prior work focused on the removal of (emotionally neutral) information from mind and demonstrated that suppressing a specific thought and clearing one's mind of all thought rely on different neural mechanisms. Moreover, the prior findings indicated that these mental operations differentially affect one's ability to take in new information after the old information has been removed. The focus of the proposed project will be to examine how emotional information is removed from current thought. The project will ask three main questions. First, it will examine whether the emotional valence of information affects the engagement and effectiveness of neural systems involved in removing information from mind. A series of parallel studies, one involving neuroimaging and the other examining people's behavior, are designed to examine whether these removal operations are affected by a) the emotional valence (positive, negative) of the information to be removed, b) the emotional valence of the information that should now be brought to mind and c) the match (e.g., positive, positive) or mismatch (positive, negative) between the valence of the information being removed and that which replaces it. Expectations are that negative information will be harder to remove and easier to be brought into current thought than positive information. Second, the project will examine whether the effectiveness of these removal operations varies across individuals. It will assess the degree to which individuals report that they have difficulty controlling their thoughts, the degree to which they have symptoms related to depression and anxiety, and their ability to hold and manipulate information in working memory. Expectations are that individuals who report difficulty in controlling their thoughts will have difficulty in removing information from mind, and that people with higher levels of depression will have specific difficulties in removing negative thoughts. Third, the project will examine whether individuals can be trained, using real-time feedback about brain function during neuroimaging, to effectively remove thoughts from mind by providing them with a sense of what it feels like to successfully remove a thought. The results of the proposed project will have important implications both for understanding the recurrent and intrusive thoughts that characterize psychopathology and for providing insights on how they might be reduced. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to understand the mental processes and brain systems that enable people to purposefully remove emotional thoughts from their minds. The project will utilize neuroimaging of the brain in conjunction with cutting-edge computational techniques taken from computer science to assess how well individuals can remove specific thoughts from mind. This work has important implications for psychiatric disorders in which the ability to remove specific negative, intrusive, or maladaptive thoughts is compromised.",Removing and Manipulating Emotional Information in Working Memory: Cognitive and Neural Representations,10450323,R56MH125642,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mind', 'Nature', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'design', 'expectation', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'success']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R56,2021,770369
"Precision mapping of individualized executive networks in youth ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) improves dramatically during childhood and adolescence, and failures of EF are associated with both a broad range of negative outcomes and diverse mental illnesses. The brain circuits responsible for EF are spatially distributed, and include the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and salience systems. These networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a straightforward mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, multiple independent efforts in adults using precision functional mapping techniques have recently demonstrated that there is marked inter-individual variation in functional topography, which is defined as the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that individual variation in functional topography is a critical determinant of EF in youth. Our collaborative team recently published the first report of individualized functional networks in children using a cross-sectional sample (Cui et al., Neuron 2020). In this proposal, we will build upon this initial work by replicating and generalizing this finding using two large cross-sectional datasets with high-resolution imaging: the Healthy Brain Network (HBN; n=5,000) and Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D, n=1,300). Critically, we will also leverage the unprecedented resources of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD, n=11,572) to delineate within-subject change in personalized networks. In this proposal, we will first harmonize these massive data resources using advanced techniques originally developed for statistical genomics (Aim 1). Next, we will describe how personalized networks evolve with age (Aim 2) and predict EF (Aim 3). Finally, we will use machine learning tools to discover how the functional topography of personalized executive networks predict dimensions of psychopathology in a data-driven manner (Exploratory Aim 4). Throughout, we will adhere to best practices of open science to maximize reproducibility, and ensure that all processed data, code, and results are openly shared with the neuroscience community. Together, this research will establish that functional topography is essential for understanding EF, and will motivate trials of personalized neuromodulatory therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during childhood, and executive dysfunction is associated with risk taking behaviors, a broad range of negative outcomes, and psychiatric illness. A greater understanding of individual variation in brain networks that support executive function may be critical for the development of personalized interventions in diverse conditions. These novel clinical interventions would benefit the public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Precision mapping of individualized executive networks in youth,10178201,R37MH125829,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'support network', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R37,2021,818531
"2/2-Neurodevelopmental and Clinical Trajectories of Youth at Risk for Bipolar Disorder ABSTRACT Although bipolar I disorder is a dynamic condition expressing a wide range of affective, cognitive and neurovegetative symptoms, it is defined by the occurrence of mania. Mania typically first emerges in adolescence and young adulthood, and it is a strongly predictive phenotype. Moreover, the early course of bipolar I disorder is progressive, as euthymic periods shorten over time. Additionally, bipolar I disorder is strongly familial with heritability rates approaching 85%. A family history of bipolar I disorder increases risk for mania as well as a number of other psychiatric conditions, including suicidal behaviors and reward hypersensitivity. Together, these characteristics suggest that bipolar I disorder results from an inherited failure during adolescence to develop healthy neural systems that modulate mood and behavioral activation. Complicating the inherited risk is that people with a family history of bipolar disorder also report higher rates of early life adversity than the general population. Early life adversity is associated with lifelong elevated rates of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders, impaired risk-reward processing, and suicide. Consequently, during development individuals with a familial risk for bipolar I disorder may be exposed to a dual risk, i.e. an inherited vulnerability and environmental early-life stress. How these risks interact to impact brain development and subsequent outcomes in these individuals is not known.  Mood and risk-reward behaviors are managed by intersecting ventral prefrontal networks. These networks undergo substantial development in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood (when bipolar I disorder emerges) in which maturation of prefrontal networks leads to adaptive adult emotional regulation and risk-reward processing. Abnormalities in these networks are commonly described in both bipolar disorder and in response to early life adversity, with many shared characteristics. With these considerations in mind, we hypothesize that heritability for bipolar I disorder interacts with early life adversity to synergistically disrupt healthy ventral prefrontal network development during adolescence, underlying a cumulative increased risk for developing mania and other conditions more common in bipolar families. To test this hypothesis, over a four-year interval we will assess trajectories in ventral prefrontal network connectivity in youth at-familial-risk for bipolar I disorder compared to those without this risk, and the interaction with or without early life trauma, to determine whether these risks cumulatively lead to increasing emergence of: 1) mood symptoms and syndromes, 2) substance misuse, 3) suicidal behaviors, and 4) approach motivation hypersensitivity. These results can inform future approaches to prevent illness onset and progression in individuals at risk for or early in the course of bipolar disorder. NARRATIVE Bipolar I disorder typically emerges during adolescence or young adulthood. Using longitudinal study of ventral brain network in youth with or without a familial risk for bipolar I disorder, and with or without childhood maltreatment, we propose to define how brain developmental abnormalities evolve to produce bipolar I disorder.",2/2-Neurodevelopmental and Clinical Trajectories of Youth at Risk for Bipolar Disorder,10181961,R01MH125867,"['21 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early-life trauma', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Youth', 'austin', 'early life adversity', 'early life stress', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'mood symptom', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal behavior', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2021,624675

"Resting state connectivity signatures of obsessive compulsive symptoms PROJECT SUMMARY Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness that exhibits bimodal timing of onset, with up to half of cases beginning in childhood. Subclinical obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) often precede the development of clinically significant OCD, though symptoms in some children remit naturally over time. However, the neural bases of OCS and their changes over development are poorly understood. Capitalizing on large, publicly available datasets and sophisticated computational methods, I propose to examine functional MRI signatures of OCS and their longitudinal trajectories in children and adolescents. Specifically, I will apply machine learning to publicly available data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a prospective community sample tracked longitudinally at 21 diverse sites across the United States, to reveal whole-brain functional MRI patterns that correspond to OCS severity. Baseline data is already available from approximately 12,000 children aged 9-10 whose families have committed to ongoing follow-up. I will then use data from the independent Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study, which includes data from approximately 2,500 children from the New York City area, to statistically and clinically validate these patterns (Aim 1). I will then combine baseline neuroimaging and clinical data with longitudinal follow-up clinical data from the ABCD study to examine neural signatures that predict subsequent OCS trajectories (Aim 2). Finally, I will leverage data collected from children with clinical-severity OCS (i.e., OCD) before and after gold-standard cognitive behavioral therapy at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) to identify pre-treatment predictors of response and remission (Exploratory Aim). Collectively, these aims will identify brain connectivity features that correspond to reliable patterns in which OCS co-vary, which could hint at common mechanisms underlying multiple symptoms and implicate specific circuits that can be targeted in future studies aimed at developing and testing novel treatments and prevention strategies. Furthermore, this research proposal integrates a detailed training plan that will bring me closer to my goal of becoming a physician-scientist focused on clinical and computational psychiatry. Supported by the resources of both Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the NYSPI, I will deepen my technical skills in MRI image processing, neuroimaging analysis, and machine learning, while also improving my scientific writing, oral presentation, and clinical skills. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) such as intrusive thoughts, excessive worries, and repetitive behaviors have a lifetime prevalence of 30%; onset during childhood increases risk for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), but can also spontaneously remit with time. To date, the neurodevelopmental trajectory of OCS remains poorly characterized. The goal of this proposal is to use computational methods to identify neural signatures that reliably represent OCS, predict longitudinal trajectories and response to first-line psychiatric treatment.",Resting state connectivity signatures of obsessive compulsive symptoms,10387818,F30MH126504,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Skills', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'aged', 'attenuation', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatic improvement', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2021,49040
"Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY In the healthy brain, white matter connections coordinate the speed and reliability of communication among spatially distributed regions. The transmission of neural information with fine temporal precision is crucial for executive function (EF), defined as the coordination of attention, memory, and inhibitory control for goal-directed actions crucial for survival, health, and well-being. Notably, EF undergoes protracted development throughout youth, and the development of executive deficits is present in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the degree to which transdiagnostic executive deficits arise due to abnormal development of white matter networks remains unknown. Existing neuroimaging studies of transdiagnostic executive deficits have been limited by 1) inadequate methods to assess neurodevelopmental patterns of spatially distributed brain regions, and 2) inadequate theories of neural communication at the level of macro-scale structural networks. Here we address the latter challenge by generalizing long-established theoretical principles and empirical observations of efficient neurotransmission at the microscale neuron level to the macroscale structural connectome by calculating transmission fidelity. Transmission fidelity models how efficiently a brain region embedded in the structural network can transmit messages to a target region with individually differing speed and reliability. Moreover, we address the former challenge by capitalizing on advances in network science and machine learning. Utilizing these methods is a promising direction for investigating abnormal brain development. In this proposal, we describe the application of a novel analysis of structural network maturation to study the manifestation of transdiagnostic executive deficits. Using a large sample of youth who completed cross-sectional neuroimaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=1,042), our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structural connectivity and EF across age. We will use an additional cross-sectional dataset enriched with youths presenting with psychopathology acquired through the Healthy Brain Network study (n=5,000) to generalize our findings to executive dysfunction. To quantify developmental norms, we will capitalize on our large-scale datasets to train a machine learning model that predicts expected ranges of healthy brain development. Furthermore, understanding within-person changes in brain structure and EF necessitates longitudinal data. We will longitudinally assess youths diagnosed with ADHD (n=50) or schizophrenia (n=50), and typically developing comparators (n=40). In this proposal, we aim to 1) delineate how age-related variation of brain network transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders, and 2) determine how within-individual development in transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction in ADHD and the psychosis spectrum. A better understanding of atypical inter-individual and within-individual developmental patterns of brain networks provides a framework towards precision medicine in neuropsychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individualized therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how developmental deviations from expected norms of brain maturation manifest as psychopathology. We propose to apply a novel method based on network science and machine learning to provide a new perspective on the brain’s developmental patterns that can manifest as executive deficits that span psychopathology. To delineate the typical and atypical development of executive function, we will develop a quantification of within-person longitudinal patterns of brain network maturation contextualized in predictions of developmental norms from unique large-scale neuroimaging datasets of youth.",Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology,10233459,F31MH126569,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'individualized medicine', 'inter-individual variation', 'large scale data', 'mental development', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'transmission process', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms Abstract This project aims to develop WormInvestigator™, a novel, highly innovative system for performing automated, high-throughput and longitudinal studies of the behavior of C. elegans worms freely moving and socially interacting on agar plates (hereafter: ""freely moving worms"") across multiple time points over extended times (e.g., multiple days) with repeated measures designs. Work in Phase I will focus on demonstrating feasibility of our novel, patent pending, WormRecognizer™ technology – the ability to perform automatic, image-based identification of individual C. elegans worms within a group of freely moving worms (""digital tagging of freely moving worms""). Work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of WormInvestigator for the commercial release. The innovation inherent in WormRecognizer will serve as the basis for enabling a game- changing innovation in the field – the ability to perform high throughput longitudinal, repeated measures design analyses of locomotion and other behavior of freely moving C. elegans worms from discrete, non-continuous video sequences. Compared to study designs that have independent groups repeated measures designs offer more statistical power and the possibility to track an effect over time. Specifically, repeated measures designs for analyzing locomotion and other behavior of freely moving worms will allow researchers to definitively assess the likelihood that a particular behavior is associated with a prior behavior, which is impossible without repeated measures designs or impractical continuous imaging and tracking under constant illumination. WormRecognizer will leverage the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform automatic identification of the tracks of the same worm in videos of groups of freely moving worms recorded at different time points; encouraging pilot data were generated during preparation of this application. C. elegans is increasingly used as a model organism in research focusing on brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and pathological alterations thereof, including research into neurodevelopment, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Thus, WormInvestigator will enable significant advancements in various mental neuroscience applications that use C. elegans as a model organism. Specifically, the fact that C. elegans express many of the neurotransmitters and associated receptors that are found in higher eukaryotes, including humans, makes C. elegans highly attractive for the (high throughput) screening of next generation therapeutics for mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as for disorders that rely on neurotransmitter release modulation such as next generation treatments for schizophrenia. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of WormInvestigator in close collaboration with expert neuroscientists. Market research performed during preparation of this application indicated that WormInvestigator will expand the use of C. elegans as a model organism to many laboratories that do not currently use them. A competing technology is not available. We anticipate the global market size for WormInvestigator to be more than 300 systems. Narrative Performing longitudinal studies and repeated measures design analyses in both short-term and long-term experimental assays focusing on the analysis of locomotion and other behavior of multiple C. elegans worms holds the promise of profound progress in next-generation neuroscience studies such as understanding neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as aging research, drug discovery and toxicology. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using new analytical methods based on artificial intelligence algorithms that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform these data-rich longitudinal studies and, thus, repeated measures design analyses in assays using C. elegans as a model organism. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.","AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms",10258638,R43MH126834,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Agar', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eukaryota', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Market Research', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Serotonin', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'fighting', 'free behavior', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neural network architecture', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmitter release', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'social', 'usability']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,449987
"Behavioral and Neural Heterogeneity in OCD and Depression Project Summary This project investigates behavioral and neural heterogeneity in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) using hypothesis- and data-driven approaches. OCD and MDD are major sources of disability worldwide, with fewer than half of patients responding adequately to first-line treatments. Treatment may be impeded by the fact that OCD and MDD are both highly heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing psychological and neurobiological etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework seeks to address this problem in part by investigating dimensional components of behavior that span across disorders and more closely align with brain circuitry than does the multifaceted diagnostic phenotype. In the present project, we follow an RDoC approach to the study of heterogeneity by investigating relationships between behavior, clinical symptoms, and brain function using task-based and resting-state fMRI in a sample of 75 OCD patients and 75 MDD patients. Our preliminary data in OCD patients and individuals with depressive symptoms point to interoceptive sensitivity (IS) and perseverative negative thinking (PT) as dimensional components of behavior that are not only transdiagnostic but also explain important within-disorder heterogeneity; the first aim of this proposal builds on these findings by investigating associations of IS and PT with clinical symptoms, behavior, and brain function in OCD and MDD. Complementing this hypothesis-driven approach, the second aim of the project is a data-driven investigation using unsupervised machine learning (ML) to uncover neurobiological profiles that characterize variability in brain function across OCD and MDD. Building on our preliminary analysis identifying three subgroups within OCD distinguished by differential patterns of resting-state functional connectivity, we will investigate neurobiological heterogeneity across OCD and MDD and link clinical and behavioral data to neurobiological subgroups using a comprehensive ‘deep phenotyping’ approach to data acquisition and analysis. The overarching goals of both aims are to identify factors contributing to heterogeneity that can be developed as novel targets for personalized treatments based on an individual patient’s neurobehavioral profile. Project Narrative Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are common and disabling psychiatric disorders, treatments for which have been hindered by their heterogeneity in clinical presentation and underlying mechanisms. This project investigates the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms, behavior, and brain function in OCD and MDD using hypothesis- and data-driven approaches.

"A neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal interoception in anorexia nervosa PROJECT SUMMARY Given that anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness and current treatments show limited efficacy, there is a crucial need to better understand the brain mechanisms driving the pathophysiology of this disorder. This proposal combines an experimental medicine approach focused on gastrointestinal (GI) interoception with computational modeling to probe neural circuits of interoception and appetite-related gastric processing in AN. The goal is to identify perceptual and neural markers for AN at the individual patient level and apply machine learning methods to test clinical outcomes prediction longitudinally. Supported by our preliminary data, this proposal is based on the premise that the pathophysiology of AN includes a computational dysfunction manifested by cognitive suppression of the expected precision of afferent interoceptive signals associated with hunger, which reduces their motivational influence and facilitates maladaptive and avoidant eating behaviors. We propose a case-control study with 65 AN and 65 healthy comparisons who will undergo extensive baseline testing using a novel GI interoception probe during measurement of symptoms, behavior, circuits, and physiology. Sensory stimulation will occur during the premeal period, anchoring responses to an anticipatory context with high relevance to the disorder. These individuals will be followed for 180 days to examine clinical outcomes. A computational approach will examine the basic hypothesis that AN individuals have lower sensory precision for GI interoception and that the degree of sensory imprecision is related to clinical characteristics. Moreover, we will examine the relationship of this imprecision to circuit and physiological measures. We will then apply machine learning approaches to these neurophysiological and perceptual measures to longitudinally test the prediction of clinical outcomes. Achieving the aims of this project will provide unique insights into the pathophysiology of AN by arbitrating whether AN is a consequence of “top-down” or “bottom-up” dysregulation in the nervous system, which could transform our understanding of how intrinsic interoceptive disturbances lead to AN. Pragmatically, it will result in new technologies for identifying interoceptive dysfunction at the individual level, allowing psychiatry to develop diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of AN. Thus the neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal interoception in AN could be used to develop low-cost, scalable, and objective tools for identifying dysfunction in individual patients, to facilitate neurobiologically-based definitions of recovery, and to predict the risk of relapse following treatment. Finally, this proposal lays the groundwork for the future development of precision psychiatric interventions such as perceptual retraining therapies to target (and recalibrate) abnormal brain- body interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, yet we have a poor understanding of the biological causes of this disorder. In this proposal we examine the basic question of whether individuals with AN have poorer “gut sensations” which enable them to fast and lose weight despite severe medical consequences. In this project, we use a novel probe, which may eventually be useful as a marker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment success in AN.",A neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal interoception in anorexia nervosa,10278979,R01MH127225,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Bulimia', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hunger', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ingestion', 'Inpatients', 'Interoception', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'anxious', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'capsule', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'food restriction', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal system', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mind body interaction', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,LAUREATE INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN RESEARCH,R01,2021,404878
"Discovering prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers of the psychosis spectrum using network control theory PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia, and other disorders of the psychosis spectrum (PS), most commonly emerge throughout development and are thought to be caused by disruptions to normative brain maturation occurring during this time. Critically, deviations from normative neurodevelopment are thought to precede the emergence of clinically significant PS symptoms by several years, highlighting the profound impact that their discovery would have for psychiatry research; if we can successfully identify the antecedent brain abnormalities, then we may be able to intervene early and reduce the risk of individuals developing schizophrenia. Uncovering these antecedent brain abnormalities requires predictive models built upon recent advances in network neuroscience and machine learning; moreover, such models must be coupled with large samples of longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data to uncover truly prognostic biomarkers. Finally, sex differences are found in both the PS symptoms and neurodevelopment. Thus, studies that provide a precise understanding of how sex interacts with PS symptoms and abnormal neurodevelopment are needed. The purpose of the current study is to use advanced tools from network neuroscience and machine learning coupled with multi-modal neuroimaging to uncover biomarkers that can predict the emergence of PS symptoms throughout development. To achieve this goal, we will draw on multiple largescale cross-sectional and longitudinal neurodevelopmental datasets, including the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, the Healthy Brain Network, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, to study brain structure and connectivity. We use Network Control Theory (NCT) to study connectivity. NCT treats the brain as a dynamical system allowing us to probe a region's capacity to control changes in brain states via white matter pathways. Compared to graph theory, NCT is a contemporary approach that posits an explicit model of how the brain's structure informs and constrains its function, enabling mechanistic insight into the dysconnectivity associated with the PS. We will quantify developmental abnormalities in NCT metrics using a nascent machine learning technique known as normative modeling. A normative model builds a growth chart of brain development that incorporates the expected variation in the relationship between age and the brain into its predictions. Then, deviations from these growth charts can be understood in terms of what is and what is not expected in a normative population. Here, we will build cross-sectional (Aim 1) and longitudinal (Aim 2) normative models of NCT metrics and use multivariate deviations to predict PS symptoms out-of-sample. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate the extent to which deviations from normative neurodevelopment mediate the relationship between sex and PS symptoms. The goal of this Pathway to Independence award is to build on my strong background in psychiatry, multimodal neuroimaging, network neuroscience, and machine learning by expanding my expertise to developmental psychopathology, NCT, and longitudinal neuroimaging data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will uncover the abnormalities in brain development that precede and predict the emergence of psychosis spectrum symptoms in youth. A detailed understand of such antecedent brain abnormalities is critical for early identification and intervention of disorders related to the psychosis spectrum, such as schizophrenia. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of psychosis-related disorders on individuals and society at large.",Discovering prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers of the psychosis spectrum using network control theory,10284489,K99MH127296,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusions', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hallucinations', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Youth', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological sex', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'control theory', 'cost', 'dynamic system', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'graph theory', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'insight', 'male', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2021,109778
"Longitudinal trajectories in treated and untreated schizophrenia Studies of the untreated course of non-affective psychosis have been largely limited to urban samples with short duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) (less than 5 years). We propose to take advantage of a unique, time-limited opportunity to study the extended untreated course of psychosis among individuals with psychosis (IWP) with very long DUP (>30 yrs), in predominantly rural areas of China. Our first goal is to develop knowledge about the course of untreated ongoing psychosis and associated neurobiology over a span of decades. Our second goal is to expand knowledge about initiating treatment (e.g. antipsychotic medications) in IWP who remain untreated into late adulthood. This R01 proposes a 3-year follow-up of 400 untreated IWP, 400 treated IWP, and 400 healthy controls (HCs) from mainly rural areas of Guangxi Province and Hunan Province (matched on key variables). Our primary focus is on cognitive performance, but we will also compare the 3 groups on other symptomatic and functional domains. Moreover, comparisons of prolonged untreated IWP who accept treatment (i.e., the ‘newly-treated’) versus refuse treatment (i.e., the ‘ongoing untreated’) will provide crucial information about the effects of initiating antipsychotic treatment in IWP with extended DUP. Our specific aims include: Aim 1) compare change in cognitive performance from baseline to 3-year follow-up in 3 groups: ongoing untreated IWP, matched treated IWP, and matched HCs. 1a) we hypothesize in the primary analysis that decline in cognitive performance over 3-year follow-up, measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), will be greatest in the ongoing untreated group, intermediate in the matched treated group, and least in HC. 1b) a secondary analysis will similarly compare changes in specific cognitive domains and those who show progressive cognitive declines between the 3 groups, in the same order hypothesized in 1a). Aim 2) conduct secondary analyses to compare change in measures of psychopathology, social and vocational functioning, medical co-morbidity, and social burden from baseline to 3- year follow-up among the same 3 groups specified in Aim 1. Aim 3) conduct secondary analyses comparing the ongoing untreated and newly treated groups with respect to: 3a) change in cognitive performance; 3b) change in psychopathology, functioning, medical co-morbidity, and social burden. In Aims 3a) + 3b), we identify characteristics of newly treated IWP who remain nonresponsive to treatment. 3c) identify patient-, family-, and other stakeholder-level factors associated with medication uptake via the 686 Program. Aim 4) via capacity-building, we identify a cohort of new clinical researchers and provide training via this large-scale study in guiding them towards sustainable research careers. Finally, in exploratory analyses, we will compare “brain age gap” (i.e., an imaging measure of brain age minus chronological age) over the 3-year period in a subset of individuals from each group. We propose to illuminate the course of cognition in a large sample of prolonged, untreated psychosis, thus advancing understanding of psychosis in China, other LMICs, and worldwide. A global mental health priority is to identify and treat individuals with non-affective psychosis in low and middle income countries. This project seeks to: (1) develop knowledge about the course of chronic untreated psychosis and to provide a rare source of insight into the underlying nature of the illness that may illuminate key pathophysiological pathways of psychosis worldwide; and (2) expand knowledge about initiating medication treatment among individuals with psychosis who remain untreated into late adulthood. This will be especially relevant to low- and middle-income countries where treatment is being scaled up to reach individuals with psychosis in rural communities where duration of untreated psychosis can be very long.",Longitudinal trajectories in treated and untreated schizophrenia,10306962,R01MH127631,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Education', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Priorities', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Province', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychoses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scoring Method', 'Selection Bias', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'follow-up', 'human old age (65+)', 'insight', 'low and middle-income countries', 'programs', 'recruit', 'rural area', 'scale up', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'treatment response', 'uptake']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,10000
"Evaluating overlap and distinctiveness in neurocomputational loss and reward elements of the RDoC matrix PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence indicates that disruptions in loss and reward valuation exist across traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories, and these elements are featured in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria matrix. However, validating these features of the RDoC matrix and determining the translational utility of loss and reward valuation requires at least three critical advances: i) understanding the elements’ relational structure (i.e., to what extent are loss and reward valuation linked or distinct), ii) establishing the functional relevance of valuation measures (i.e., which features of loss and reward valuation are related to which symptoms), and iii) determining the stability or lack thereof of the elements and relationships between the elements (i.e., determining which valuation features are state-like vs trait-like). To work toward validating valuation elements and their relevance to psychopathology, we respond to RFA-MH-19-242 (Computational Approaches for Validating Dimensional Constructs of Relevance to Psychopathology). Specifically, we take a data-driven, computational psychiatry approach merging clinical and experimental data to delineate relationships among computationally derived components of loss and reward valuation and with symptoms in a large sample of participants with clinically significant mood, anxiety, or anhedonia (Aim 1). In Aims 2 and 3, we incorporate a mechanistic trial to assess whether components of and relationships between loss and reward valuation are sensitive to change a) over time, b) following 12 sessions of instructed valuation (Aim 2), or c) following cognitive behavioral therapy (Aim 3). If successful, we believe there is immense opportunity to bridge behaviorally-oriented clinicians and computational (neuro)scientists and advance the field by mapping symptoms to neuromechanistic disease processes and spurring the development of new neurobehaviorally- guided treatment approaches. As required by the RFA, this application assesses multiple constructs (loss and reward valuation constructs and learning subconstructs) in the Negative and Positive Valence RDoC domains, using multiple tasks and levels of data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Difficulties in how people respond to negative and positive outcomes (called `valuation') in our environment can be related to debilitating depression and anxiety. Here we use novel neuroscience and computational methods to study how links among depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and different types of valuation vary over time and can be changed. This work may lead to new ways to understand the role of valuation in mental health and neuroscience-guided behavioral approaches for treating symptoms regardless of mental health diagnosis.",Evaluating overlap and distinctiveness in neurocomputational loss and reward elements of the RDoC matrix,10312509,R01MH127773,"['Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'improved', 'negative mood', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'symptom treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,788923
"CRCNS: Multimodal Dynamic Causal Learning for Neuroimaging CRCNS Research Proposal: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Dynamic Causal Learning for Neuroimaging A Project Description A.1 Introduction Many analyses of fMRI and other neuroimaging data aim to discover the underlying causal or commu- nication structures that generated that activity.1,2 An accurate characterization of these brain structures is important for understanding neural circuits, systems-level neuroscience, and the neural bases of var- ious cognitive psychological phenomena or mental diseases. Brain structures learned from neuroimag- ing data also provide a powerful diagnostic tool for predicting everything from the concepts currently in one’s mind3–5 to whether one suffers from different mental diseases.6–10  Given the importance of such brain connectivity networks, it is unsurprising that a wide variety of learning algorithms have been developed for different neuroimaging modalities. In particular, many of these methods aim to infer the underlying causal or connectivity networks from data (in contrast with model comparison methods such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM)11). These network discovery methods have achieved some notable successes,2,6,12–21 but have also largely failed to address two issues that can impede our ability to achieve improved understanding of the full, working brain. Our project will develop, validate, and apply methods that solve both of these challenges.  First, existing brain connectivity inference methods can be roughly divided into two groups: static me- thods that do not actually treat the brain as a dynamic system (e.g., IMaGES22 and most of the ap- proaches tested by Smith et al.23); and dynamic methods that explicitly measure and model the dy- namics of the brain. Static methods obviously fail to use all of the available information. In contrast, dynamic methods use the full structure of the measurements, but essentially all such methods24–28 infer causal and connectivity structures at the timescale of the measurement modality, rather than at the brain’s causal timescale. However, the networks learned from data at the measurement and brain timescales can be quite different, even given solutions for all of the other statistical and measurement problems facing neuroimaging analysis.29 Moreover, the important facts about causal or connectivity structure are frequently about which brain regions communicate directly with which other brain re- gions, which requires a focus on the brain timescale, not the measurement modality timescale. It is thus scientiﬁcally critical that we have methods that can determine the causal connections that exist at the timescale of the underlying neural systems, not just those that are found at the timescale of our particular neuroimaging methods.  Second, there are multiple neuroimaging measurement modalities, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are obvious and widely recognized advantages of multimodal information fusion: 1) access to multiple, richer datasets, larger sample sizes, and improved estimation quality; 2) improved spatial coverage of the brain compared to fast dynamic modalities alone; 3) improved dynamic coverage of the range of signals that are informative about interactions of brain networks; and 4) enhanced estimation quality and reductions in modality-speciﬁc deﬁciencies due to complementary aspects of different modalities. These advantages are heavily exploited for feature and representation learning; our group has been highly active in this ﬁeld.10,30–37 However, to our knowledge, no methods have been developed and validated that can learn causal information (effective connectivity) using data from multiple modalities. There exist machine learning methods (developed by members of our group) that can combine causal information from disparate datasets,38–41 but these methods have never been applied to multimodal neuroimaging data. Moreover, use of these methods to combine spatially precise (e.g. fMRI) and dynamically precise (e.g. EEG, MEG) modalities requires a theory of the differences in 1 n/a",CRCNS: Multimodal Dynamic Causal Learning for Neuroimaging,10396137,R01MH129047,"['Ache', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'causal model', 'diverse data', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,353742
"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach,10279690,R01DK129888,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Allografting', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histopathology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lesion', 'Living Donors', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical encounter', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interstitial', 'kidney allograft', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'renal damage', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,625886
"Renal MRI Biomarkers: The Route to Clinical Adoption Project Summary/ Abstract Functional renal MRI biomarkers are underused in research and clinical practice due to the need for dedicated in-house expertise and development. Transferring solutions to other centers is therefore a challenge, leading to a significant duplication of efforts, a lack of standardization in the methods, and difficulties in comparing results between centers. This also limits commercial buy-in, hinders the establishment of multi-center trials, and overall impedes the translation of these biomarkers into clinical practice. Our proposed workshop (https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2021/Renal/) aims to bridge this gap. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together internationally recognized scientists and clinicians with new investigators who are currently developing and applying advanced renal MRI techniques in order to investigate the causes and consequences of kidney disease. The program of this workshop integrates clinical presentations outlining the needs for non-invasive testing and biomarkers with presentations on recent advances in contrast-based MRI, new applications of relaxometry, diffusion, and elastography, multinuclear applications, pre-clinical animal studies, and application of artificial intelligence techniques. With an important focus on the next generation, the workshop will include mentoring sessions for trainees and new investigators, called “Meet the Experts.” These mentoring sessions will provide specific information on clinical trials design, funding and regulations, as well as a hands-on “how I do it” sessions on available imaging post-processing software. This workshop is designed for researchers (including Ph.D. students and postdocs); clinicians (e.g., radiologists, nephrologists, renal transplant surgeons); MR technologists; government regulatory experts; nonprofit and academic groups interested in early diagnosis of renal disease; as well as members of the ISMRM, ASN, and PARENCHIMA. The program is designed for both senior investigators and junior scientists, with relevant topics for our attendees interested in continuing medical education. It presents knowledge of new methodologies in using quantitative MRI to diagnose and monitor a range of medical conditions, e.g., renal tissue injury, oxygenation, contrast and non-contrast perfusion, renal pre-transplant and post- transplant evaluations, etc. We will provide methods for utilizing this knowledge in clinical trials and practice, as well as guidance on data analysis. A key element of our plan is to reach out to women and minorities to encourage them to attend and participate in our workshop. This workshop will be a first in North America but follows three previous European meetings co-organized by the UK Renal Imaging Network (UKRIN) and the COST action “MRI Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney Disease” (PARENCHIMA). (https://renalmri.org). These previous workshops were attended by over 150 participants and presenters. Thus, we expect robust interest in the community for the proposed workshop.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,10219819,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'limb loss', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,496614
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10238171,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine', 'thrombotic']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,686450
"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10173881,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'hypoxic ischemic injury', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,425096
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10240592,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'excessive weight gain', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'remote delivery', 'remote intervention', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,175248
"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete. The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress. We propose to develop a lab-on-a-chip platform technology, Multifunctional Exosome Sorter (MFES), that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers integrating; (i) a vessel-on-a-chip module, (ii) a high-yield exosome size-based isolation module, (iii) a magnetic bead-based surface biomarker sorting chamber, and (iv) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology, where such a technological innovation will uniquely enable to study the biology of exosome subsets associated with flow dynamics in PAH.",A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH.,10158068,R21HL156761,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Culture Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vision', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hemodynamics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic beads', 'monolayer', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shear stress', 'stressor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236363
"Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective Behaviors Project Summary/Abstract A growing number of COVID-19 transmission models have been developed to help forecast the on-going epi- demic and compare outcomes of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in terms of cases, deaths, and medical supply needs. Most of these models do not include adaptive behavioral effects describing how risk perceptions and fatigue inﬂuence engagement with social distancing and transmission reduction. Decisions on mask-wearing, levels of social contact, and vaccination will deﬁne whether the epidemic is controlled or enters annual circulation. We propose the development of population-based (PBM) and agent-based (ABM) transmis- sion models to study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering the many uncertainties which still surround the virus, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Addition- ally, our models will be used to study how COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza and respective behaviors interact, exacerbate outcomes, and potentially overwhelm the health care system. These models will build upon our prior research. Since Fall 2016 we have conducted regular longitudinal surveys investigating attitudes towards, risk perceptions of, and propensity to vaccinate for seasonal inﬂuenza. The ABM models constructed from these data account for adaption and memory of past experiences, peer effects, and population heterogeneity. Using machine learning methods, we have augmented a synthetic network representative of a small US city with this behavioral data. We have continued to conduct modiﬁed versions of these surveys to track how these beliefs translate to COVID-19. In parallel, we have developed a compartmental population-based model of COVID-19, which models transmission and the effects of NPI intensity and timing on both health and economic outcomes. We propose to extend our current compartmental PBM and build a new individual-level ABM, informed by longitudinal surveys. We will conduct a four-year longitudinal panel survey to construct an empirical behavioral model for decisions to socially distance, engage in transmission reduction measures (such as mask-wearing), and vaccinate. This information will be combined with our existing synthetic network data-set to enable us to build an individual level ABM of the spread of COVID-19 in a representative US city, integrated with our inﬂuenza ABM. This model will capture both how individual behaviors impact macro-level disease transmission and how inﬂuenza and COVID-19 could interact. Insights and data from our individual-level model will be used to inform and parameterize adaptive behavior within our compartment-level model, allowing for policy comparisons across a range of US states. In addition, we will consider which policies are robust to key behavioral and technological uncertainties, such as the extent of behavior change in response to perceived risk and the timing and effectiveness of vaccines. Finally, we will develop web-based interactive tools that allow for the exploration and comparison of different policies in a variety of potential futures. Project Narrative The trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic is shaped by individual behavior. We propose the development of new transmission models of COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza that study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering important uncertainties, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Building on our prior work on vaccination behaviors for inﬂuenza and the transmission of COVID-19, these models will be informed by tailored longitudinal surveys, observed behavior, and case data from the ongoing pandemic, and we will develop tools that run our models and allow users to identify the effects of behavioral factors on policy effectiveness, evaluate the potential impact of vaccine availability, and identify strategies that are robust to a wide range of uncertainties.",Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective Behaviors,10365006,R01AI160240,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ally', 'Attitude', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic state', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Policies', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Psychology', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Distance', 'Social Network', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral response', 'comparison intervention', 'decision research', 'disease transmission', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'flu transmission', 'health economics', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'medical supply', 'models and simulation', 'novel vaccines', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'peer', 'population based', 'prevent', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'risk perception', 'seasonal influenza', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine access', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2021,605840
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,10225421,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'implementation cost', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'overweight adults', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,584087
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'patient-provider contact', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Project Summary/Abstract  Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients survive years after oncologic therapy due to increased efficacy of therapy, increased incidences of human papilloma virus related HNC, and decreased numbers of smoking and tobacco related tumors. However, the majority of patients are plagued with long lasting or permanent dry mouth (xerostomia), whose severity, rate of development and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. However, current prediction models for dry mouth have intrinsic issues which so far have prevented their practical use in clinical care, including missing or incomplete data, co- occurence of multiple symptoms, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of HNC and other spatially-dependent cancers, further symptom dependency on the anatomical location of dose within to organs at risk, namely, salivary glands.  We propose to develop validated, patient-specific models to interpret radiation dose to salivary glands in order to inform individual treatment and care decisions for patients. Our data science approach circumvents limitations in the state of the art by accounting for more complex dose-reponse models of dry mouth, by calibrating for inter-patient variability, and by predicting symptom development and computing clinical action signals for a new patient based on cohorts of similar patients.  The proposed supplement application extends the methodological approach of the parent award by incorporating validation data from an alternative facility, item assessment, and user experience testing of the resultant software model user interface, undertaken within a career development plan designed to enhance and accelerate the capacity of the applicant, who is from a background underrepresented in biomedical sciences, to transition to mentored and independent investigator status, thus enhancing cancer research workforce diversity under this program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients survive years after oncologic therapy, but are plagued with long lasting or permanent residual sequelae, whose severity, rate of development and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors.

"Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology- based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome), cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4- 9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE. Nurse AMIE Project Narrative Rural patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to have access to high quality supportive care. This may have a negative effect on survival and well-being. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the survival benefits of a high quality technology based supportive care platform among 344 underserved, low income patients with metastatic cancer living in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia.",Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV,10085516,R01CA254659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Schedule', 'Self Care', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'West Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'men', 'opportunity cost', 'pedometer', 'personalized decision', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'rural setting', 'rural underserved', 'rurality', 'symptom cluster', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor', 'urban setting', 'usual care arm']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,656763
"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Late Effects', 'Link', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'associated symptom', 'behavioral health', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'dashboard', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'outcome prediction', 'patient portal', 'patient variability', 'personalized risk prediction', 'premature', 'preventive intervention', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep behavior', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool']",NCI,ST.
