"FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal we plan to contribute addressing the above foundational and operational challenges by advancing the science of influenza modeling and contributing novel methods and data sources that will increase the accuracy and availability of seasonal and pandemic influenza models. To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach. The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1 (A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing and harmonization of modeling approaches. The objective of this proposal is to advance the science of modeling and contribute novel methods and data analytics tools that will increase the understanding of seasonal and pandemic influenza in the context of the network of modeling teams coordinated by the CDC. To address these challenges, we plan to develop a novel global modeling framework, contribute new data and methods for improve the accuracy and validation of flu modeling approaches, and evolve successful methodologies to advance the analysis of layered intervention with artificial Intelligence.",FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control,10220796,U01IP001137,[' '],NCIRD,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,750000
"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Clinical and Translational Science Award Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE Overall: Summary Lead: Reza Shaker MD 5 year direct: NIH/NCATS: $16,140,360 Institution: $34,670,756 Total: $50,811,116 In CTSA 3.0, we will continue our relentless pursuit to transform clinical and translational research in southeastern Wisconsin and the science of clinical and translational (CT) research. We remain focused on and committed to expansion of an engaged, knowledgeable, and high performing CT workforce, refinement of proficient and innovative infrastructure to support CT research and science and removing all impediments to the performance of research. Our long-standing mission to foster a borderless, collaborative, and synergistic research and research training environment for our multi-institutional translational workforce, our community stakeholders and health system members to advance the clinical/translational science research and improve the health of our community, our nation, and beyond continues to drive our direction. We remain committed to working within the CTSA consortium to learn from our colleagues across the nation and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the CT field. The tri-lateral mutually learning ecosystem formed by our workforce, the community, and the health system shapes the framework for strategically moving forward and has led to the concept developed in this application of integrated clinical and research ensembles (ICREs) in which patients, clinical investigators, translational researchers, health system representatives, community members, population ambassadors, basic scientists, clinicians and others are brought together. We will further expand our outreach into the communities we serve, reaching deeper into underserved communities, and will incorporate CT research across the life span to pediatric, geriatric and underrepresented populations. In the end, our goal is to use our hard-earned experience and extended capabilities to address the unmet health needs of our patients and our community while persevering to advance our infrastructure and workforce development programs to meet the standards of the developing field of translational science and research. Page 166 Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE  Project Narrative Our community is in need of better preventive measures, more accurate diagnostics and more effective and efficient therapies. We offer a novel and comprehensive mechanism to address this need through research and education. We propose to create a mutually learning ecosystem that coalesce a myriad of requisite stakeholders including health systems, research enterprises and the community in southeast Wisconsin to work in tandem towards solutions that improve the health outcomes of our citizens.

"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career. n/a",Institutional Career Development Core,10368487,KL2TR001862,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Good Clinical Practice', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'community based participatory research', 'diversity and inclusion', 'experience', 'externship', 'health disparity', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'peer coaching', 'programs', 'success', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,YALE UNIVERSITY,KL2,2021,1318718
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences.

"UT Southwestern Center for Translational Medicine Contact PD/PI: Toto, Robert D OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Center for Translational Medicine (CTM) at UT Southwestern is a collaboration among 7 academic institutions, 5 health care systems, 6 teaching hospitals and the North Texas community. Our mission is to improve health in local and global communities through innovation and education. Over the past two funding cycles, our CTSA catalyzed innovation and transformed the culture and landscape of our program Hub. We have trained >1,000 members of the translational workforce, co-led the formation of the Accrual to Clinical Trials CTSA network and established new translational technologies, methods, and processes critical to the translational process at every level. We engaged our local communities early on in the design and conduct of clinical research. We also formed new collaborative research services and education and training programs designed to address the top health challenges of our community and the nation. Through these efforts, the CTM has generated considerable momentum toward advancing translational science propelled by a highly collaborative environment that is hard-wired for Team Science and Community Engagement.  Over the next 5 years, we will optimize the organization of our CTSA Hub for more efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into interventions that will ultimately result in the improved health of both our local populations and, in collaboration with the CTSA Network, the broader U.S. population. We will discover, develop, demonstrate, and disseminate new informatics and artificial intelligence solutions to challenging problems in translation at all levels. In collaboration with Hub partners and relevant national CTSA networks, we propose to develop new methods and processes to further the integration of research into practice at the point of care. Building on our success, we are now poised to achieve the five key objectives of the CTSA Program and the Center for Translational Medicine with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Produce a well-trained, highly skilled, diverse Translational Workforce. Aim 2. Inculcate Community Engagement and Team Science. Aim 3. Integrate diverse populations across the lifespan into clinical and translational research. Aim 4. Promote innovation and new scientific Methods and Processes. Aim 5. Develop innovative Informatics solutions to overcome translational roadblocks. Aim 6. Increase Workforce Heterogeneity. Impact: With our highly-integrated dynamic research and training environment in place, our Hub will have a powerful and sustained impact on the field of translational science. We will make a major leap forward in the scope, efficiency, and quality of clinical and translational research for the benefit of our Hub and the national consortium. We will collaborate with the Center for Leading Innovation and Collaboration, the Trial Innovation Network, and the Center for Data to Health to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and improved health.

"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN. n/a",ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks,10332268,OT2TR003441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digestion', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Provider', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'arbitrary spin', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'capsule', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'database query', 'distributed data', 'innovation', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,1052712
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10330631,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2021,736476
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10267034,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442905
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications to enable more granular and pervasive measurement, prediction, and provide behavioral interventions offers immense promise in reaching the goal of precision health to maintain the overall health of populations. When applied to devices encountered in our everyday environment, (e.g. personal computers, mobile phones, computer mice, even office furniture such as sit-stand desks), machine learning algorithms can amplify the impact of technology on health improvement by its ability to passively sense stress, and to provide just-in-time behavioral interventions based on contextual data and self-reported user feedback. At the same time, the ethical dimensions of these innovative lines of work – some of which entail fundamental concerns about privacy and autonomy – require careful attention from the scientific community. Most critically, there has been little engagement with the end-users of such technologies as a major stakeholder group who are most affected by these learning systems and tools. This administrative supplement request is premised on the fact that the rationale for and unmet needs targeted in the scope and aims of the parent grant can be even more effectively met (i.e. not changed but enriched) by adding participants with direct exposure and personal experience of interacting with precision health technologies to the last stakeholder group in the parent grant (i.e. patients). By extending the patient group in Aim 1 to include those directly participating in cutting-edge research at the intersection of occupational and precision health research, the Aims and Scope of the parent grant remain unchanged, while the real-world application and impact of the products from the parent grant are substantially enhanced. Our Supplemental proposal incorporates precision health technologies involving behavioral interventions of stress management that use ML into the first Specific Aims of the parent R01. In Supplemental Aim 1, we will use semi-structured interviews and qualitative methods to articulate ethical issues in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in behavioral interventions as part of a precision health methodology, with particular attention to occupational health contexts. Specifically, our methodology elicits a wide range of viewpoints from participants by comparing two distinct types of machine learning applications (i.e. physical versus digital interventions), with two varying degrees of autonomy that users may exercise to accept or reject the AI-recommended interventions. Both of these applications present novel ethical questions regarding the decision-making role of ML/AI algorithms in behavioral health research and practice. This supplementary project leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated as a result of machine learning applications in precision, behavioral, and occupational health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based and AI-driven precision behavioral health now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. The failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of end-users as a major stakeholder group will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. An empirical approach to anticipating ethical concerns is needed to provide practitioners, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in precision behavioral health.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10367404,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Furniture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Morals', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Precision Health', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical decision support', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'real world application', 'response', 'stress management', 'surveillance data', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,157426
"CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning Translational research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been hindered by the lack of shared data resources with sufficient depth, breadth and diversity. There are very limited EHR datasets freely available to the general research community especially the AI research community through credential-based access. MIMIC dataset is from a single institution that has a fixed and limited racial, ethnic and geographic profile. The eICU dataset is limited in data comprehensiveness (e.g., number of kinds of lab tests ~1/5 of MIMIC), data span (1 year, 2014- 2015), and data variety (e.g., no free text clinical notes) etc. Thus MIMIC and eICU respectively have advantages and disadvantages of data depth and data breadth. The vision of this proposal is to leverage multiple CTSAs with diverse racial, ethnic and geographic profiles in order to develop and evaluate a multi-site de-identified ICU dataset, to facilitate accelerate translational research in AI and deep learning approaches to understand, track, and predict the pathophysiological state of patients. In this project, a group of nationwide CTSA sites will work together to build a new, more inclusive, multi-site dataset that is downloadable from NCATS cloud by researchers with credential-based access. This project will combine the respective advantages of MIMIC (data depth) and eICU (data breadth). The created dataset will include more geographic regions, larger quantities of time-series data, including pre-, during- and post- ICU patient information. This will incorporate not only more patient diversity, but also capture regional population differences and practice variations that could have clinical impact. Aim 1 will develop and provide credentialed access to a multi-site dataset consisting of de-identified discrete outpatient, inpatient, and ICU data for critically ill at respective CTSAs. Aim 2 will create federated access dataset from and develop novel federated learning methods on the part of the multi-site ICU data consisting of unstructured clinical notes or structured data for select group of patients at higher risks of re-identification (e.g., rare disease patients). Aim 3 will develop novel memory-network based meta-learning AI algorithms and use the multi-site dataset to answer concrete and long-standing clinical problems in critical care. Aim 4 will innovatively leverage the library network to develop and disseminate open resources for the research community and develop best practice guidelines for other CTSAs to join the effort. In particular, we aim to support and cultivate the growth of next generation medical AI workforce for research and practice. We aim to establish a large cross-CTSA collaborative data sharing for critical care by leveraging the existing CTSA collaborative networks. With the diversified racial, ethnic and geographic profiles from the above CTSAs, we will be able to support fair and generalizable algorithms for advanced patient monitoring and decision support. The proposed project will provide best practice guidance to and set up exemplary examples for nationwide CTSAs. It will also support the cultivation of next generation medical AI researchers.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population - AI/ML Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population.

"MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period Project Summary/Abstract Problem: Depression during pregnancy affects approximately 10% of women and is related to low birthweight and preterm birth. Similarly, up to 9% of pregnant women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and abuse, with over 41% of assaults resulting in physical injury, and almost 30% requiring medical treatment. When untreated, these risks cost health systems at least $50B/year. Mitigation has proven difficult, where women are reluctant to disclose during clinical visits, and clinicians are unaware of resources. There are no integrated health technologies that enable timely disclosure of risks during pregnancy then aid in making decisions about risk mitigation. Fortunately, most women of reproductive age own a smartphone, and users report comfort disclosing health information to smartphones under the right conditions. Naima Health’s Proposed Solution: Naima Health is developing a digital health platform that pairs our MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) smartphone application with an EPIC-integrated provider portal to (i) identify risks early in pregnancy, (ii) communicate those risks to women and their providers, and (iii) assist decision-making about risk mitigation. MHP identifies risk using ACOG-approved screenings, then helps patients and providers make real-time decisions about mitigation. The proposed solution aligns with the CDC’s priority of developing mobile app-based decision support systems for mental health and IPV screening, assessment, and referral. Proposed SBIR Work: In Phase I we developed expert and machine learning models to identify risks during pregnancy, then characterized issues facing Spanish-speaking women. In Phase II we extend these Phase I results using semi-structured interviews with patients and providers to understand site-specific requirements for psychosocial risk screening and referral, then update the MHP platform to meet those requirements (Aim 1). We then validate the updated platform’s performance using qualitative cognitive testing with patients and providers to ensure the platform meets site-specific requirements (Aim 2). Finally, we evaluate the platform’s acceptability and feasibility at two collaborating clinic sites, focusing on the rate of depression and IPV detected through the platform compared to historical rates, and the prevalence of risk mitigation actions measured through patient calls/click-throughs and provider referrals (Aim 3). Project Narrative Untreated psychosocial risks during pregnancy, such as depression and intimate partner violence, are significant adverse health outcomes for both parent and child, costing society more than $50 billion per year. Digital health tools for patients and providers can promote early identification of those risks to aid rapid intervention. The MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) mobile phone application and provider portal combines decision science, medicine, machine learning, user-centered design, and app development to identify and mitigate clinical and psychosocial risks during pregnancy.",MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period,10396887,R44DP006417,[' '],NCCDPHP,"NAIMA HEALTH, LLC",R44,2021,497952
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10232047,U01FD007057,[' '],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2021,200000
"Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation Genomic data hold the promise of revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of human disease. Multiple barriers stand between the acquisition of the data and realizing these and other benefits. Rapid accumulation of genomic data far exceeds our capacity to reliably interpret genomic variation. New developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with increased computing power and domain knowledge, provide hope for the deployment of enhanced computational tools in both basic research and clinical practice. Use of these methods critically depends upon reliable characterization of their performance.  The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (C-CAGI) will address these needs, through objective evaluation of the state of the art in relating human genetic variation and health. CAGI has had five editions since 2010 with 50 challenges posed to the community taken on by hundreds of predictors, leading to scores of publications about prediction methods and their assessment. We propose for C-CAGI to continue to advance the field of variant interpretation through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop community experiments to evaluate the quality of computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data. C-CAGI will conduct community experiments in which participants make bona fide blinded predictions of disease related phenotypes on the basis of genomic data. We will engage a diverse predictor community to spur innovation. The CAGI Ethics Forum will vet studies to ensure that privacy and sharing maintain the highest standards and will educate the community. 2. Assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data; highlight innovations and progress at interactive conferences. Predictions will be evaluated by independent assessors, who will be supported by new assessment approaches from C-CAGI. Results will be presented at CAGI experiment conferences with deep technical engagement, which will be interleaved with reflective CAGIâ meetings that create an environment for a comprehensive evaluation of the field, facilitating identification of major bottlenecks and problems faced by the current genome interpretation approaches. 3. Broadly disseminate the results and conclusions from the CAGI experiments and analysis. C-CAGI will outreach to the broader scientific and clinical community through its publications, and the creation of a calibrated reference integrated into the most common workflows for ready adoption. CAGI will also be represented at international meetings with presentations and workshops. 4. Operate effectively and responsively. C-CAGI will operate efficiently as it closely interacts with hundreds of participants. CAGI will build upon a robust information infrastructure that securely facilitates data dissemination, prediction submission, and assessment. Genomic variation is responsible for numerous rare diseases, for propensity for many common traits and diseases, for drug response, and is a key characteristic of cancer evolution. At present, our ability to characterize genetic differences far exceeds our capacity to interpret them either for basic research understanding or for clinical application. The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation, operating on robust ethical foundations, will provide an evaluation of the current state of the art and help promote progress in understanding the impact of genomic variation.",Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation,10179441,U24HG007346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleotides', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'data dissemination', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'high standard', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multiple omics', 'operation', 'outreach', 'response', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U24,2021,314933
"Center for Collaborative Research in Minority Health and Health Disparities Hispanics are one of the largest racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States and are disproportionately affected by health issues. Hispanic population datasets are not as available as for other ethnicities. Data Science (DS) is an interdisciplinary field that aims to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science, which considers building smart machines capable of ""thinking"". Machine Learning (ML) refers to analytical algorithms that iteratively learn from data. Thus, given the need for health disparities research with a focus on Hispanic health, there is an urgency on strengthen and enhancing the diversity of the NIH-funded workforce by utilizing DS for making Hispanics datasets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), and applying AI/ML approaches in this field to extract knowledge from Hispanic dataset to mitigate health disparities. In response to Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) ""Administrative Supplements to Enhance Data Science Capacity at NIMHD-Funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI)"", we aim to enhance and build capacity for investigators and students in DS/AI/ ML topics such as Jupyter Hub, coding with R, RStudio and Python, using ML libraries and other cutting-edge techniques to address and mitigate Hispanic health disparities. We will develop a new course, ""Applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Health Disparities Research (AIML+HDR), focused on data analysis using Hispanic datasets, that represents multiple levels and domains of influence in the NIMHD Research Framework. This bilingual (Spanish and English) online asynchronous course will initially target mainly trainees at the University of Puerto Rico and other Hispanic institutions. The organization of the AIML+HDR will follow the data science project lifecycle and will be divided in two modules. Module I will focus on using DS to make the Hispanic datasets FAIR and include different modules for data understanding and data wrangling. Module II will add topics for creating AI/ML predictive models for diagnostic and treatments of Hispanic patients, including modules related to model planning and building phases. To develop examples and projects, we will use Hispanic datasets from public repositories such as the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) and All of Us project, and from private repositories such as AbartysHealth. This novel training course will diversity the NIH-funded data science workforce through the development of competencies and skills in Hispanic investigators and graduate students, who will then generate Hispanic datasets that are FAIR and apply AI/ML approaches to create relevant predictive models.

"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,10126058,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,369515
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,10136061,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579506
"PharmGKB:  pharmacogenomics discovery and implementation 7. Project Summary Pharmacogenomics studies how genetic variation influences drug response phenotypes and is a pillar of precision medicine—choosing the right drug for the right patient at the right dose and time. A public resource of pharmacogenomics information is critical—both to catalyze basic discovery of the molecular mechanisms that drive variability in drug response and to support the implementation of clinical research to understand how to best deliver pharmacogenomics in the clinic. The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) is the premier public repository of pharmacogenomics information. PharmGKB curators focus on high quality extraction and representation of knowledge in the primary literature, and capture information about individual genetic variations that impact drug response, the potential clinical impact of these variations, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of drug response, the pharmacogenomic requirements in regulatory documents (labels), and guidelines for genome-driven prescribing. The PharmGKB website hosts more than 60,000 unique IP visits per month and provides flexible access to pharmacogenomics knowledge on multiple devices. Most importantly, PharmGKB serves as a hub for the research community in pharmacogenomics and precision medicine—integrating its contents with critical resources and organizations including ClinVar, ClinGen, the FDA, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and others. In this proposal, we request support for PharmGKB as a Genomic Community Resource, and outline a plan to (1) curate pharmacogenomic knowledge from the published literature and from relevant databases, combining manual curation with automated methods for triaging important knowledge, (2) build tools that catalyze the discovery and use of pharmacogenomic knowledge, by providing the content of our knowledge base in novel ways useful to our users, and (3) collaborate with efforts devoted to implementation of genomic medicine, by providing the best scientific knowledge to support these efforts. 8. Project Narrative Drug response is inherited in much the same way as other traits like height, hair color, and the risk for some diseases. Pharmacogenomics studies how human genetic (DNA) variation influences the response to drugs.

"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management.

"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting). This study would be the first to provide a bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe. This approach directly supports core scientific values of inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and reproducibility that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global. Project Narrative This study would be the first to develop an initial bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe—not least because poorly developed data models have the potential to impact adversely the health of individuals, groups, and communities. Currently, there is limited conversation around potential bioethics issues in data modeling, and as yet no implementable guidance on how biomedical data science modeling research activities should occur. The initial ethics framework developed by this study would provide a roadmap to ensure that data modeling decision points are documented and their ethical ramifications considered at the outset of model creation, thus supporting core scientific values of inclusivity, accountability, reproducibility, and transparency that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global.",Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points,10250400,R21HG011277,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethical Review', 'Ethics', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'data tools', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'high standard', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informant', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'model development', 'patient population', 'population health', 'programs', 'public trust', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NHGRI,"HASTINGS CENTER, INC.",R21,2021,202625

"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Altered Level of Consciousness', 'Behavior assessment', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Prognosis', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawing Care', 'Work', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'effective intervention', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neonatal patient', 'neonate', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'premature', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'respiratory', 'response', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond  The prevalence of skin diseases is extremely high in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in children. If left untreated, some have debilitating lifelong physical disabilities and deformities, as well as social and mental effects. Among them are skin infections which are listed as members of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) by the World Health Organization and targeted for disease control globally. Many of the NTDs, including leprosy, Buruli ulcers, yaws, and lymphatic filariasis, are co-endemic in West Africa. Early detection and treatment is currently the most effective measures for their disease control. However, this is hampered by a paucity of skilled healthcare workers in the remote areas of the LMICs where they prevail. On the other hand, diagnosis of these conditions can be done with patient history and simple skin examination, without undergoing invasive examinations requiring special skills and equipment. This is very well suited to field settings in LMICs. With a targeted training, technology-assisted decision-support system and a telemedicine network, local healthcare workers could be leveraged to enhance the diagnosis and management of the skin conditions. This project proposes to do so through development and validation of an mHealth tool for skin diseases in LMICs: the ‘eSkinHealth’ application. It is a portable smartphone or tablet application that could provide: a) direct diagnostic and management assistance to healthcare workers in remote setting, and through teledermatology, b) storage of longitudinal patients records for improved follow-up, and c) organization of clinical and image data of the skin. There is a general lack of good clinical photos of skin diseases on dark skin, and collection of photos made through this project could be further used for development of photo guides for wide use and future studies on dermatology of skin of color. The purpose of the proposed research is to complete development and optimization of eSkinHealth and carry out its effectiveness studies on the field. The R21 phase of the work will assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the prototype, validation of a novel built-in wound scoring system, and standardization and optimization of dermatologic photography on dark skin. The R33 phase will evaluate the performance of the app on outcomes of surveillance and management of NTDs and further optimization of photo analysis of skin lesions on dark skin using the image optimization technology. The research will be carried out in a western-African country of Côte d’Ivoire. It will build on our previous work in surveillance of NTDs in rural Côte d’Ivoire and trainings to local healthcare workers, as well as our expertise in mHealth. It will leverage our multi-year collaboration with investigators from Côte d’Ivoire, application developers in Japan, and tropical medicine expertise from Tulane University. If successful, eSkinHealth will be instrumental in overcoming the current gaps and weaknesses in dermatological services in LMICs providing a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations, as well as contributing to the dermatology of skin of color worldwide, envisioning Skin Health for All. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the prevalence of skin diseases are very high in LMICs, especially in children, dermatological services in LMICs are lacking mainly due to lack of clinical skills, and further, ways to document and store clinical course which is important for individual patient follow-up do not exist. If there is a field-adapted platform for data collection and sharing for skin conditions allowing clinical decision support for healthcare providers onsite, and remotely through teledermatology, this could serve as a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations. In this project, we will complete the development and optimization of a powerful and comprehensive, but easy-to-use smartphone / tablet application tool that addresses these gaps, envisioning Skin Health for All.",MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond,10269622,R21TW011860,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Buruli Ulcer', 'Caring', 'Case Management', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Skills', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deformity', 'Dermatologic', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economics', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Equipment', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Infectious Skin Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Ivory Coast', 'Japan', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Leprosy', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photography', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Remote Consultation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Manifestations', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Yaws', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'intelligent diagnosis', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'member', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'physically handicapped', 'pilot trial', 'portability', 'prototype', 'sharing platform', 'skills', 'skin color', 'skin disorder', 'skin lesion', 'social', 'support tools', 'teledermatology', 'tool', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",FIC,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2021,181957
"Using community health centers to mitigate the impact of snakebite envenoming in low resource areas Abstract Globally, more than 90% of all snakebite envenomation (SBE) occur in low resource settings. This neglected tropical disease, affects 2.7 million people, with 81,000-138,000 deaths, and approximately 400,000 permanent disabilities annually. Antivenom is a safe, efficacious, time- dependent, and evidence-based treatment, but the availability and timely access to this standard of care is inadequate. It is critical to engage local communities to improve timely access in remote, low resource areas where most SBE morbidity occurs. This proposal will develop and evaluate an innovative multi-modal intervention to improve SBE care, including decentralized antivenom distribution among the existing community healthcare center (CHC) network in the Brazilian Amazon. This novel intervention will integrate (a) advanced geospatial artificial intelligence to create decentralized antivenom distribution models using existing CHCs that optimizes population coverage and time to reach care, (b) a cost-effectiveness evaluation model developed with key stakeholders, and (c) a culturally relevant SBE care package containing education, treatment guidelines, training on antivenom delivery and interfacility care coordination. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct a formative evaluation of this multi-modal intervention and prepare an implementation strategy for the Brazilian Amazon, as well as prepare to scale up to other low resource locations. Consequently, we will have a standardized approach to use advanced analytics to optimize healthcare delivery in low resource settings that can be used in other countries and with other healthcare interventions.

"MUST Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH) Overall Research Plan Project Summary. Significance. Data science hold great promise for sub-Saharan Africa, yet research capacity and appropriate training are limited. Medical images are particularly exciting for data science in this setting given their ability to facilitate care delivery across healthcare cadres. Efforts to translate the knowledge gained through data science into improved clinical care can be fostered through implementation science. Strategic multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional partnerships will be key for the development and ultimate impact of data science for African-based solutions. Innovation. This proposal is innovative in 1) its use of data science with medical images for advancing clinical care, and 2) integration of data science with implementation science to promote clinical impact. Approach. The Mbarara University Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH) in Uganda will use multiple technologies to improve the capture of medical images and employ key data science methods, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to expand their utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical impact will be strengthened through implementation science methods. Formal training will be available for both data science and implementation science, and ongoing expansion of efforts will be promoted through regional summits and collaboration. The two initial research projects—optimized posterior fundus imaging to diagnose posterior segment eye disease and mobile- phone based cervical images to detect cancer—will involve partnerships with the College of Ophthalmologists of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa in Kenya and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana, respectively. Massachusetts Institute of Technology will provide technical support for data management and analysis, and Massachusetts General Hospital will support the use of implementation science and other relevant content areas for individual research projects. Each project will work with local Ministries of Health, community-based organizations, and/or technology partners to advance the mission of harnessing medical images for improved clinical outcomes and impact. Our specific aims are as follows:  1. To integrate all partnering academic institutions, technology companies, and non-governmental  organizations to advance data science for medical imaging. All partners will contribute to a common  infrastructure for data processing and analysis. We will establish both the administrative and technical  mechanisms for data exchange, accounting for necessary data security and quality assurance and control.  We will further create pathways for facile expansion to include additional research projects involving  medical imaging (e.g., in radiology and dermatology) at multiple African institutions.  2. To integrate implementation science with data science to advance clinical impact. All research  projects in the MUDSReH will include implementation science methodologies to ensure the developed  technology reaches the end user in practical ways that meet local needs and priorities. Overall Research Plan Project Narrative Medical images offer great potential for supporting clinical diagnosis and care management; however, their utility for African researchers and clinicians are limited by the number of images available, insufficient linkage to relevant clinical data, limited data from African populations for proper image interpretation, and poor implementation in clinical practice. The Mbarara University Data Science Research Hub is designed to overcome these barriers through robust Data Management and Analysis and Administrative Cores, initially supporting projects in posterior segment eye disease and cervical cancer with plans for expansion to new projects and sites, as well as training in data science and implementation science.",MUST Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH),10312539,U54TW012043,"['Academia', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Car Phone', 'Central Africa', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Security', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eastern Africa', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Ghana', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kenya', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Nongovernmental Organizations', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posterior eyeball segment structure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Site', 'Southern Africa', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'computerized data processing', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data quality', 'design', 'fundus imaging', 'health care delivery', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'open data', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology diffusion', 'uptake']",FIC,MBARARA UNIVERSITY/SCIENCE/ TECHNOLOGY,U54,2021,1294297
"Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program (COBIP) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the significant human health and disease burden in Africa, no biomedical data science graduate degree programmes in computational omics, clinical informatics and translational research are offered on the continent. To foster research training that will cultivate graduates able to respond with agility to future biomedical data science needs and develop innovative solutions to address African health challenges, formal interdisciplinary training in biomedical data science is needed. Such training opportunities should include: (i) Biomedical data science applied to data from multi-omics and other technologies, such as biomedical imaging, coupled with the ethical, legal and social Implications of these advances; (ii) Fundamental and advanced concepts in machine intelligence and computational paradigms for developing novel approaches for mining large-scale biomedical data; and (iii) Awareness, amongst graduates, of career opportunities within biomedical data science along with how the soft and hard skills gained in the training program could be transferred into a range of biotechnology/biomedical industries and research/professional careers. Motivated by these needs and leveraging the expertise in clinical and translational research as well as biomedical informatics at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), we propose to develop the “Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program” (COBIP) at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The program will introduce graduate degree programs to train African biomedical data scientists and faculty in rigorous fundamental data science, computational omics, clinical informatics and imaging data science. COBIP will lead to the development of solutions that address the African disease burden and are relevant to global health. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Develop an interdisciplinary data science training program focused on the health and healthcare needs and priorities of Africa; 2) Train faculty with relevant disciplinary backgrounds, from collaborating African institutions, in biomedical data science to support the development of the field across the continent; and 3) Establish COBIP as an international center of excellence in computational omics and biomedical informatics, distributed across African institutions as a collaborative network of faculty, researchers, and students focused on the African health priorities. COBIP will attract cohorts of trainees from diverse backgrounds including mathematics, statistics, informatics, computer sciences, engineering and biomedical sciences. COBIP will provide innovative educational infrastructure and research opportunities as well as links between clinicians, researchers and biomedical industries through placements and internships. COBIP, through its graduates, will have decisive impacts on African biomedical data science research and stimulate diagnostics, therapeutic selection and drug development to support improved human health and healthcare in Africa and globally. NARRATIVE For this Research Training Program, the University of Cape Town will partner with Oregon Health & Science University to provide interdisciplinary training opportunities to develop the next generation of researchers working on aspects of fundamental data science, computational omics and imaging data science.

The Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services (NCDS) will coordinate national efforts to provide training and resources to increase capacity among librarians to support two of the National Library of Medicine’s strategic goals: 1) accelerate discovery and advance health by providing the tools for data-driven research, and 2) build a workforce for data-driven research and health. The NCDS team brings a broad set of data skills to this undertaking, as well as experience in successful development of institutional data support and in developing resources for, training, and mentoring librarians on the national level. The NCDS will work collaboratively with the NNLM’s Regional Medical Libraries, Offices and Centers (ROCs), draw upon extensive connections with national data organizations to increase outreach and partner on programming, and assemble an external advisory board with expertise in clinical informatics, bioinformatics, community engagement, machine learning, data ethics, and open science to solicit feedback on our efforts and to maintain awareness of a breadth of current data issues. The NCDS will partner with the National Evaluation Center (NEC) to better understand the needs of the communities we are serving, ensure that training, resources, and support are designed and delivered in ways that meet those needs, generate information on best practices, and evaluate the achievement of the program aims. The proposed education programs will emphasize careful curation of existing content over “reinventing the wheel” in order to build resources such as an online Data Roadmap for self-directed learning and a repository of curricular resources. The NCDS will also focus on support for knowledge application and consolidation, offering courses with coaching to assist in bringing knowledge into practice and training in coding followed by codeathons to consolidate knowledge. Other programming will include a series of unconferences to support community building and development of resources. We will develop a pipeline program to provide data librarianship internships to Library and Information Science and college students from communities currently underrepresented in the profession. The NCDS will take advantage of multiple channels to communicate, including website, blogs, and social media, as well as collaborating with the ROCs and external partner organizations for outreach. The NCDS will use a coordinated, data-driven, innovative approach, to build capacity for providing data services among health information professionals, and in this way facilitate efficient and reproducible research and promote greater collaboration. Project Narrative Scientific progress towards improving public health is impeded when researchers lack the skills to collect data in a way that will allow results to be reproduced, analyze data efficiently through use of the best available tools, and share data so that it can be found and used by others for further research. Librarians are well positioned to support these needs for researchers, but often need training in specific skills and support in establishing the library as a provider of data services. The Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services of the Network of the National Library of Medicine will coordinate national efforts to provide training and resources for librarians to develop in this area and internships for prospective data librarians from populations underrepresented in librarianship.",NNLM Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services,10405683,UG4LM012347,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community of Practice', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Education', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'Institution', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Librarianship', 'Libraries', 'Library Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Series', 'Services', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Work', 'community building', 'community engagement', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'open data', 'outreach', 'programs', 'prospective', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'service programs', 'skills', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'university student', 'web site', 'working group']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,UG4,2021,525000
"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health. Results from our project can be utilized to inform system-wide and local strategies to improve community health.",Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research,10217256,R01LM012849,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site Visit', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'density', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'land use', 'obesity risk', 'object recognition', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'social', 'social media', 'substance use', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,329673
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,10165820,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,345325
"Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning toImprove Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency Caring for patients in the operating room (OR) requires a complex set of resources, personnel, and logistics. Improving the accuracy, speed, and granularity of information exchange in this environment significantly impacts outcomes, safety, satisfaction, & access to care. Additionally, increasing efficiency can have a significant positive economic impact, an important implication for all hospitals. Therefore, automation of manual documentation and task coordination can enhance productivity, safety, and profitability, as well as job satisfaction for clinicians.  The Whiteboard Coordinator (WC) platform solves these market challenges through artificial intelligence (AI) driven OR workflows and resource management. The platform is deployed on a virtual server within a hospital’s local network. It communicates with the existing electronic medical record (EMR) to import the day’s surgery schedule and assigned resources. Once OR workflow begins, an intelligent network of sensors and cameras employing machine vision algorithms record locations and times of patients, equipment, and supplies. As clinical activities begin, the software automatically alerts all stakeholders of important events via text and paging to coordinate clinical processes. Information is also disseminated on digital displays throughout stakeholder locations, such as the OR, preoperative holding, post anesthesia care unit, sterile supply, high-traffic hallways, and break rooms. Given the unpredictable nature of surgical procedures, this automated information feed ensures all providers are effortlessly informed, allowing all stakeholders to synchronize independent, but parallel workflows. The intelligent sensor network of cameras and machine vision algorithms automatically detects and updates availability and location of resources. The software automates existing manual logistics documentation. Finally, WC rapidly disseminates detailed information in a targeted manner (i.e. to specific surgeons, nurses, technicians, janitorial staff, etc.) to eliminate alarm fatigue and enhance productivity.  The project includes four main aims. First, the Phase I prototype platform will be enhanced with new features to fully support user workflow and efficiency across all OR stakeholders. Targeted updates will focus on connected data domains and cross platform integration, user interface workflows and automated reports, and voice command integration. Second, the AI suite will be significantly updated with novel tools that build upon the Phase I framework including detection of novel surgery types & events, detection of surgical supplies & inventory management, and a simulation toolbox for resource planning. Once all platform updates have been technically verified and validated, the supporting infrastructure and production ecosystem will be scaled to support commercial release. This includes formal quality functions, operations, support and staging/production environments. The Whiteboard Coordinator platform and production environment will be validated against quality system requirements, then deployed in a large-scale field study to document OR effectiveness and utility. The objective is to enhance, scale, and commercially deploy Whiteboard Coordinator, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven software platform for hospital operating rooms (OR) that reduces documentation burden, optimizes workflows and resource planning, and allows clinicians to focus on patient care. The objective is to ensure patient, surgeon, anesthesiologist, technicians, nurses, janitorial staff, equipment, instruments, supplies, rooms and beds are available at required times and locations. Given the number of inputs, complexity of processes, and dynamic temporal adjustments, this high stress clinical environment can strongly benefit from automated monitoring and AI driven coordination.",Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning toImprove Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency,10319306,R44LM013026,"['Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Day Surgery', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and Supplies', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding Agency', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Interruption', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Sterility', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'digital', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'machine vision', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NLM,"ARTISIGHT, INC.",R44,2021,837789
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",10242838,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,176379
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. The success of this project will improve the prediction of ASCVD and serve as a model for health information exchange derived risk estimation and population-guided preventative therapy recommendation.",Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data,10225340,F30LM013320,"['Address', 'Age', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Status', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'black patient', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical sciences', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'portability', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'tool']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,53536
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342
"Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management Project Summary  The easy availability of huge amount of user generated health information on social networks, blogs, YouTube, Twitter, and hospital review sites presents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how social media can be a channel to inform and communicate healthcare information to patients and facilitate patient- centric health promotion and literacy improvement. YouTube hosts over 100 million healthcare related videos on a variety of medical conditions. This plethora of user-generated content can be leveraged by patients to improve adherence to clinical guidelines and self-care required for management of chronic diseases. In this project, we propose an augmented intelligence-based approach that effectively combines human input from domain experts and consumers with machine learning and natural language processing methods from computer science to winnow down and retrieve relevant, contextualized video materials that clinicians can recommend to patients. The problem of identifying the most relevant videos from a patient perspective is challenging, but provides an immense innovation space for this approach. We will leverage a co-training machine learning framework and incorporate inputs from patient education assessment tools and clinicians to assess diabetes- related videos on two dimensions: the amount of medical information encoded in the videos and video understandability. We will develop a user-centric patient education video recommender system by integrating these two dimensions with the YouTube video ranking results. Furthermore, we will apply a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines computational evaluations, comparisons with YouTube baseline, and causal analysis methods to understand the performance of the automated methods and the relationship between video understandability and collective user engagement. Finally, we will integrate our computational approach in a modular research prototype technology platform that will accept health related YouTube videos as inputs (generated from patients' keyword searches on diabetes) and produce a ranked list of top 10 retrieved videos for further review by clinicians, and evaluated for barriers and facilitators of the technology usage. Recommending relevant educational materials in video format that leverage user-generated content is one way to deliver personalized and contextualized healthcare information, and resources for self-care management, to patients and consumers. As technology continues to advance and evolve, our methods can be refined further and evaluated via clinical trials to improve patient education, empower patients, caregivers and clinicians, and improve societal health and health literacy. Project Narrative This proposal aims to complement and expand existing approaches for health promotion and health literacy improvement in the population by developing and evaluating automated methods for the easy retrieval of understandable, contextualized patient education videos that clinicians can recommend to their patients from the enormous corpus of user generated content on YouTube. This approach offers the potential for significant impact on patient engagement and empowerment due to its scalability and generalizability. Leveraging advanced machine learning methods for automation combined with social science methods for impact evaluation also allows the incorporation of critical elements for improved patient-physician communication such as transparency, credibility and relevance of the recommended materials.",Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management,10212707,R01LM013443,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Educational Materials', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Centers', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'digital treatment', 'empowerment', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'literate', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social media', 'success', 'two-dimensional']",NLM,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,347030
"Automated Surveillance of Overlapping Outbreaks and New Outbreak Diseases Project Summary / Abstract This project will develop and evaluate new methods for automated detection and characterization of infectious respiratory diseases. The methods will be novel in their ability to detect and characterize (1) multiple, overlapping outbreaks of known diseases, which is a situation that occurs commonly, (2) an outbreak of a new, emerging disease, which can be dangerous, and (3) a combination of 1 and 2 occurring at the same time. The ability to detect a new disease early, in the context of other common outbreaks occurring, may be particularly important if the disease causes serious illness and spreads rapidly in the population. The new methods can also use a wide variety of data to perform outbreak detection and characterization, including emergency department reports, laboratory results, retail thermometer sales in the region, and local health-related tweets. These new methods will be built upon the framework of an existing Bayesian, probabilistic system, which the investigators have developed. This system takes as input data used to perform outbreak detection and characterization, and it outputs the probabilities of different possible disease outbreaks that may be occurring, as well as their characteristics, such as their probable start times and epidemiological curves. A unique aspect of the system is its ability to use data from individual patient clinical reports, such as emergency department reports. The system applies natural language processing to the reports to derive a set of symptoms, signs, and other findings. It then uses these findings and probabilistic disease models to derive a probability distribution over the diseases for each patient. For the many patients seen in the recent past, the system uses their probability distributions as evidence in detecting and characterizing disease outbreaks. The project will be evaluated using simulated data and real data from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. It will focus on four common outbreak diseases, namely, influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus. The evaluation will examine how well the system can (1) detect and characterize multiple overlapping outbreaks of disease, (2) detect a new outbreak disease and create an accurate clinical description of it (using a leave-one-out cross validation approach), and (3) use a variety of data types to improve outbreak detection and characterization. The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, probabilistic approach for the early and accurate detection of disease outbreaks that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to clinicians and public health officials, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Narrative This project will investigate novel methods for improving the ability of public health officials and clinicians to detect and characterize infectious respiratory diseases in their regions, including overlapping disease outbreaks, which is a situation that occurs commonly, and outbreaks of entirely new diseases, which can be dangerous. The improved information is expected to better support decisions made by these individuals and their organizations, which is anticipated to reduce morbidity and mortality of the population from infectious diseases.",Automated Surveillance of Overlapping Outbreaks and New Outbreak Diseases,10094371,R01LM013509,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'County', 'Couples', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Laboratories', 'Logistics', 'Lung diseases', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Sales', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Validation', 'emerging pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogenic virus', 'population health', 'respiratory', 'respiratory pathogen']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,333005
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"The Wilmer Institute Mentored Clinician Scientist Scholar Program-Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has revolutionized the field of medicine, especially in subspecialties with access to a large number of images, such as ophthalmology. While promising, the application of ML/AI in ophthalmology is limited by the lack of clear guidelines on how to extract ophthalmic data, convert these data into a form that is usable for ML/AI model training and ensure these data are adhering to the principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). Our proposal aims to address these limitations by delineating the best practices for data curation via an online lecture series that will be available free of charge to the public, once the curriculum is assessed and validated by another academic institution (Harvard/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary). If successful, the proposal will be impactful, as it will:  1. Accelerate reproducible research in ML/AI by enabling the creation of  standardized ML/AI-ready and FAIR datasets.  2. Disseminate the best practices in data curation beyond Johns Hopkins University  (JHU), as the online lectures will be made free of charge to the public.  3. Foster the creation of standardized multi-institutional datasets that will improve  both performance and generalizability of ML/AI algorithms in ophthalmology, by  enabling federated learning approaches and external validation of models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop an online lecture series, which educates clinician- scientists on making ophthalmic data ML/AI-ready and adherent to FAIR principles. We will focus on clinical and imaging databases that are frequently used in ophthalmology, including Epic, Zeiss FORUM, and Heidelberg HEYEX. We will administer post-lecture quizzes to verify learning and reinforce fundamental concepts. To assess course relevance across various academic settings, we will deploy and test the same curriculum at a different academic institution.

"Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation Project Summary: Artiﬁcial intelligence in general and machine learning speciﬁcally, represent tremendous potential for medical imaging. Multiple projects within our Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation include the development and training of machine learning algorithms for interpreting, quantifying, and improving OCT. Through P41 support, we have previously established a collaboration with MIT Computer Science Professor Polina Golland and presently co-mentor a post-doctoral fellow with her. We have recently conducted interviews with candidates to ﬁll this fellowship and will use supplemental funding to bring in a new fellow so that we maintain progress in this important technical area, which underpins multiple TRD projects. In addition, we will expand on our dissemination eﬀorts through enhancements to our website and through new social media channels. Finally, we will maintain important recent progress that has been made in the development of high repetition rate wavelength swept lasers. Through an external vendor, we have developed high performance, chirped period ﬁber Bragg gratings. It is important to maintain the momentum of this project as the laser developments will enable multiple diﬀerent TRD projects. Relevance: The Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation has been highly productive in the development of novel imaging technologies, instruments, and applications. Several of our projects have led to commercial medical devices that improve health care. We have also been very successful in service projects that have made sophisticated imaging instruments available to a wide spectrum of collaborators in our Center and also in remote research settings. Maintaining these core eﬀorts through an interim year will permit our programs to continue without deceleration in our next competitive grant cycle.

"Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority populations Abstract Vulnerable and underserved populations such as ethnic and racial minorities, the poor, the LGBTQ community and those with physical or intellectual disabilities, often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers to receiving healthcare. While biological and clinical risks influence outcomes, sociocultural and socioeconomic factors also create major barriers to receiving healthcare services, at an individual, community and population level for these populations. These social determinants of health (SDOH), such as transportation, literacy, and finances can severely limit participation in health programs designed for the general population. Diabetes Prevention Programs are a good example of a lifestyle change protocol that is proven to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by half for pre-diabetics patients at risk by encouraging weight-loss. But, despite the effectiveness of the program, more than 50% of participants drop out before completing this year-long lifestyle change program, severely limiting the program’s success. This is in part due to the fact that programs like DPP take little account of the limitations faced by underserved and vulnerable populations that it is meant to help. This lack of support at the individual and community level combined with the fact that healthcare institutions are not designed for, nor economical, in supporting patient health outside the medical facility where it is most needed. This creates a gap in healthcare service that current systems cannot overcome. Viora is closing this health services gap with a system that interfaces between the health care system, the underserved patient, and underutilized community-based resources and providers, to facilitate better outcomes in programs like DPP. By using risk stratification based on SDOH factors, each DPP participant can have tailored interventions that consider their socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics. The Viora Health system connects patients to local resources using simple communication between the patient, health providers, and community services, facilitating patient completion of the DPP program, thereby improving health outcomes. In Phase I, Viora will evaluate a larger set of pre-diabetes and SDOH risk factors across 5000 minority and underserved subjects to select the most relevant variables for risk assessment and personal prevention plan development. The system will automatically screen pre-diabetic participants who are eligible, ready and able to adhere to DPP, and will create a personalized intervention plan that is the most impactful in reducing their risk but is also doable. The system’s communication network will be expanded to provide direct communication between the patient, DPP coach, health providers and community resources, to support the participant toward maintaining their DPP goals. Finally, the project will assess the basic function of the system, preferences and human interaction in a human subject study with underserved subjects and community-based partners. Completion of Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of our software system incorporating major components of the VIORA SYSTEM, which will inform the development of a minimum viable product to be tested in Phase 2. Narrative Vulnerable and underserved populations often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers, largely due to social and behavioral factors that hinder continued participation in disease prevention and management protocols. Viora Health’s system will have significant public health impact in scaling evidence- based protocols by using technology to identify such factors and leverage existing community based resources to support patients in mitigating these factors.","Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority populations",10325657,R43MD015981,"['Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Computer software', 'Confidential Information', 'Cost Savings', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Felis catus', 'Focus Groups', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Side', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Study Subject', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Transportation', 'Underinsured', 'Underserved Population', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'design', 'diabetes prevention program', 'diabetic patient', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'hospital readmission', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance plan', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'member', 'personalized intervention', 'physically handicapped', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'service gap', 'social', 'social culture', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'software systems', 'success', 'usability']",NIMHD,VIORA HEALTH INC,R43,2021,256591
"Algorithmic Classification of Paraphasias Summary Anomia is the inability to access and retrieve the intended words during language production, and is a cardinal feature of the acquired neurogenic language disorder known as aphasia. Aphasia affects approximately 1 million people in the US and, given the aging trend in the population, the incidence of aphasia will increase in the coming decades. Communication difficulties have a significant impact on the health-related quality of life of people with aphasia (PWA), and are associated with substantial healthcare costs. Current methods for diagnosing and characterizing anomia involve confrontation naming tests (CNTs), in which a subject is presented with an image and asked to verbally identify its contents. For example, they might see a drawing of a stethoscope, and would be expected to say the word, “stethoscope.” A subject with semantic anomia, however, might instead say “ambulance”— a word that, while incorrect, is semantically related to the target word. A subject with a different kind of anomia, in contrast, might say “telescope”— a semantically unrelated word, but one that is phonologically related. By presenting several such items, and counting the number and types of errors produced by the subject, a clinician can learn about the type and severity of anomia that the subject is experiencing.  CNTs, while clinically valuable, have several problems. They are time-consuming to administer, and to score them, the clinician must make a large number of informed, but subjective, decisions. In this project, we will be developing a computerized system to automate these decisions, which will be useful in two ways. First, it will make it much easier and faster for clinicians to administer these tests, which will save time, and will allow the clinicians to focus on their patients rather than on scoring tests. Second, our automated approach will open the door to many new ways that confrontation naming tests can be used, since they will no longer require an expert clinician to administer them. As one example of this, in the second and third aims of this project, we will be extending our computerized scoring system beyond the CNT context, and into natural language. We will develop algorithms to recognize paraphasias in spoken language samples, and to make the same classifications as to their type as we can make on CNT test items. This will enable clinicians to reliably and objectively analyze their patients' speech, and to screen for and assess their level of anomia. Project Narrative Patients who have experienced a stroke or other brain injury frequently experience anomia- a condition in which they are unable to produce words when speaking. There are several different ways that clinicians characterize anomia in their patients, but they are very time-consuming to use, and require the clinician to make difficult and subjective judgments. Our goal is to create a computerized system for detecting and characterizing an individual's anomia, which will open the door to new ways of treating anomia and reduce clinical workload.",Algorithmic Classification of Paraphasias,10256805,R01DC015999,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulances', 'Anomia', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Brain Injuries', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phonology', 'profiles in patients', 'recurrent neural network', 'trend']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,606133
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Abstract Significance: Racial and sex disparities in the diagnosis and care of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are well documented. As machine learning algorithms (MLA) become more common in healthcare settings, it is imperative to ensure that these methods do not contribute to disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial and sex groups. Research Question: Can a MLA be trained to be more accurate and less biased than commonly used risk stratification systems for ACS prediction? Prior Work: The research team developed a preliminary gradient boosted tree model for myocardial infarction (MI) prediction using retrospective data from electronic health records. On a hold-out test set, the algorithm classifier attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.92 when tested for the detection of MI at any point during a patient’s hospital stay. Other prior work by the research team involved development of a MLA to minimize bias in inpatient mortality predictions between White and non-White patient groups. The model was found to be unbiased as measured by the equal opportunity difference (EOD = 0.016, p = 0.204) and outperformed commonly used severity scoring systems MEWS, SAPS-II, and APACHE in respect to bias and accuracy. Specific Aims: In Aim 1, an unbiased model for early ACS prediction will be developed. Preprocessing the MLA training data will remove aspects of the data that reflect systemic health inequities while maintaining the aspects of the data that reflect relevant patient measurements and outcomes. Assessment of equal opportunity difference (EOD) and the Zemel statistic will provide a means to evaluate the MLA’s ability to operate without sex or racial bias. In Aim 2, the model’s performance will be compared to three commonly used ACS risk stratification scores. Evaluating model performance and bias against these systems will allow for comparison of the unbiased MLA to the current ACS standard of care. Methods: Aim 1: An ACS prediction algorithm that will be demonstrated to be unbiased when comparing performance accuracy on White vs. non-White and male vs. female emergency department patients will be developed. The model’s performance will be assessed with regard to the EOD and Zemel statistic, which measure the difference in false negative results and average predicted risk, respectively, between White and non-White and male and female patients under the null hypothesis of no difference. Aim 2: Model performance will be compared to modified versions of three other commonly used ACS risk stratification scores: the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score; the Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) score; and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, some of which have been shown to perform differentially across gender and race. EOD and the Zemel statistic will also be assessed as a measure of bias for the MLA, GRACE, PURSUIT and TIMI scores. Future Directions: The MLA will be implemented in live hospital settings for prospective evaluation. Narrative Race- and sex-related differences in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are well documented and can influence patient outcomes. Conventional risk stratification scoring systems used to guide resource allocation and treatment decisions may reflect racial and sex bias in their design and, in some cases, in their implementation. In response to the need for unbiased ACS clinical decision support tools, it is proposed herein to use machine learning to develop and validate an unbiased ACS prediction tool on the basis of electronic health record data to promote accurate and equitable recognition of ACS.",Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome,10258045,R43MD016363,"['Acute Coronary Event', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex', 'Platelet Glycoproteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SCAP2 gene', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Bias', 'Sex Differences', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Unstable angina', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'age group', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic data', 'eptifibatide', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'health inequalities', 'live stream', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'overtreatment', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'resource guides', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'sex disparity', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMHD,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2021,256585
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),10105371,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,514581
"A mobile application to offer upfront healthcare prices and automated medical billing for socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a novel healthcare cost estimator and billing management mobile application to assist minority health and disparity populations in America find affordable healthcare and accurately pay medical bills. America has the largest per capita health expenditure in the world, and Americans bear the significant burden of this with medical debt reaching US $81 billion in 2016 [1][2]. Over a quarter of Americans have challenges paying for medical care and this disproportionately impacts those minority health and disparity populations, leading to disparities in access and ultimately health outcomes. For example, Blacks/African Americans are 25% more likely to have challenges paying for medical care than the average American, Hispanics/Latinos - 30% higher and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations - 60% higher for those who earn less than $50,000 [3]. To make fully informed decisions about their healthcare and be protected from surprise billing, patients must know the price and quality of a good or service in advance. Approximately 73% of inpatient care and 90% of outpatient care with the highest-spending are offered by multiple providers through the market, meaning if patients researched and compared these before making informed choices they could see significant savings opportunities, with figures of up to 19% shown in literature [4]. However, the evidence for this is conflicting [5]. On January 1st 2021, hospital pricing data for services and procedures became available for the first time, and while this data is accessible, powerful players in the healthcare market are incented to keep this commercially sensitive data opaque to the public [4]. Access to intuitive tools that simplify the research and comparison process would make the effort minimal and incentives high to find low-cost, high quality care. The ability to save pricing information related to the providers and services a patient may need, and the out-of-pocket costs they may incur will avoid surprise bills and allow for reconciliation when bills are received. This can help avoid excessive charges and empowers patients to inquire about discrepancies. The scope of science proposed in this SBIR project is to develop a novel cost estimator search tool fed by an aggregated database of hospital pricing information combined with an automated billing reconciliation tool run on a smart device or laptop for a dynamic, user friendly experience completely free to the public. Digital products of this nature are available for businesses today and have been shown to improve employee engagement with, and accessibility and affordability of, healthcare services. However, those unable to afford medical care are 3.4 times more likely to be uninsured (28.9M Americans), and part of families with incomes below 400% of the poverty level (24.5M Americans) [6]. These individuals often don’t have the support of employer-sponsored insurance and benefits, further widening the inequalities across the population. Approximately 70% of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations do, however, own a smart device [7]. The mobile health, cost estimator and billing management application developed through this project will offer for the first time a direct-to-consumer solution agnostic of employer and health insurer, dedicated to socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and their needs. The benefit of this pioneering work will be meaningful pricing information and billing tools becoming more universally available, protecting patients, reducing the cost of care and ultimately bridging the gap in accessibility and affordability of healthcare in America. In Phase 1, we will evaluate the technical feasibility and validity of the mobile application. In subsequent phases we will evaluate the usability and effectiveness through human subjects research, while building the required partnerships and sales channels to develop a commercially viable product. Project Summary/Abstract This project has relevance to public health through its contribution to knowledge on the role of price transparency in improving access to affordable healthcare for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. It will provide insight on how an automated billing reconciliation tool can generate savings or reduce the accrual of medical debt for patients, leading to increased engagement with healthcare service. It will also demonstrate how intuitive mobile applications can be used by underserved populations to break down barriers to accessing and affording healthcare.",A mobile application to offer upfront healthcare prices and automated medical billing for socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans,10384243,R43MD017137,"['Address', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Americas', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee Engagement', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Hispanics', 'Hospital Shops', 'Hospitals', 'Human Subject Research', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Legal', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'Uninsured', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'data harmonization', 'database query', 'design', 'digital', 'disadvantaged population', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health disparity populations', 'health management', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'laptop', 'mHealth', 'minority health', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'referral services', 'searchable database', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIMHD,HANDL HEALTH LLC,R43,2021,237448
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10248503,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2021,207217
"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"The Biennial VA NCRAR Scientific Conference Series Project Summary/Abstract  The NCRAR will hold its next three Biennial Conferences starting with “Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure” in fall 2021. Subsequent conference topics are tentatively titled “Post-Pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology” and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”, to be refined based on developments in the field and participant feedback from the previous conference. These three-day intensive conferences will bring together basic and translational scientists, clinicians, patients, and health policymakers to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients with hearing and balance disorders. We hypothesize that clinical outcomes will be improved if they incorporate a collaborative, interprofessional clinical approach shaped by both the pathophysiology and the perspective of the patient. Consistent with the NIDCD's 2017-2021 Strategic Plan, these conferences aim to meet the critical need for multidisciplinary approaches to diagnose and treat auditory and vestibular deficits appropriately within a patient-centered care model.  The objectives of the 2021 conference are to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms, diagnosis, and clinical management of vestibular dysfunction. Specific topics include cellular regeneration, aging, head trauma, psychophysical testing, artificial-intelligence guided diagnosis, virtual reality-based rehabilitation, and vestibular implantation. Panel discussions with patients and experts and curated matching of mentors with students provide valuable communication and networking opportunities. A novel aspect of the conference series is the inclusion of stakeholders, such as patients and policymakers, within the clinical teaching sessions. An innovative aspect is to optimize the relevance of the case-study focused problem-based learning sessions by polling attendees regarding their challenges in clinical research and patient care. A closing discussion with the presenters and audience will recap recommendations for future research and developments in clinical care.  The conference will be limited to 200 attendees to create an intimate environment enhancing open communication. Ten scholarships provided to students and 5 to practicing clinicians will attract participants from outside the scientific community, with at least 8 scholarships awarded to applicants who are women, part of a racial/ethnic minority group, or have a disability. The conference will be publicized through social media, email and other professional meetings. Announcements will be posted on the NCRAR website, professional organization websites, and published in specialty journals. Conference content will be disseminated to non- attendees via a special issue of the American Journal of Audiology, and the conference presentations will be available at a reduced price on the NCRAR website (with presenter permissions). The purpose of this grant is to supplement the funding of three conferences (“Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure”, “Post-pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology”, and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”) to be hosted by the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research between 2021 and 2025. The aim of these conferences is to improve auditory research and clinical practice by sharing the knowledge and perspectives of patients, clinicians, scientists and health policy stakeholders to alleviate the burden of auditory and vestibular deficits on function and quality of life.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",10268162,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2021,444010
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"Homecare-CONCERN: Building risk models for preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits in homecare Project Summary/Abstract Every year, more than 11,000 homecare agencies across the United States provide care to more than 5 million older adults. Currently, about one in three homecare patients are hospitalized or visit an emergency department (ED) during the 30-60 day homecare episode. Up to 40% of these events are preventable with appropriate and timely care. In our pilot work, we developed a risk prediction model (called Homecare- CONCERN) that accurately identified patients at risk for hospital admission and ED visits solely from homecare clinical notes using NLP. This study brings together an interdisciplinary team of experts in homecare, data science, nursing and risk model development to explore whether cutting-edge data science approaches can improve timely identification of patients at risk in homecare. Our specific aims are to: 1. Further develop and validate a preventable hospitalization or ED visit risk prediction model (Homecare-  CONCERN). We will apply traditional (time varying Cox regression) and cutting-edge time-sensitive  analytical methods (Deep Survival Analysis and Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network) for risk model development. 2. Prepare Homecare-CONCERN for clinical trial via pilot testing. We will apply user centered design to  develop Homecare-CONCERN clinical decision support tool and pilot test the tool for clinical validity and acceptability. 3. Inform the future implementation of Homecare-CONCERN clinical decision support tool in the homecare  setting. We will examine if all risk elements can be mapped to a data standard (Fast Healthcare  Interoperability Resources - FHIR) and conduct interviews with key informants across the US about current  readiness, barriers and facilitators, and implementation strategies for adopting such tools in homecare setting. This proposal addresses the AHRQ program announcement (PA-18-795) to harness data to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes. The study will build a first-of-a-kind clinical decision support system to trigger timely and personalized alerts about concerning patient trends that activate appropriate and timely care to prevent avoidable hospitalizations and ED visits from homecare. Project Narrative Our previous work has shown that clinician documentation patterns and content are proxy for patient risk. “Concerning” documentation patterns can be used to identify patients who are deteriorating so clinical team can intervene before it is too late. Although several previous studies attempted to create models predicting patient’s risk in homecare, no studies to date used all available data (clinical notes and electronic health record data). This study aims to use all available clinical data on homecare patients to create personalized models of risk for preventable hospitalization and emergency department visit. We will also explore the feasibility and readiness of homecare agencies to adopt such predictive tools. Study results will catalyze a paradigm shift in homecare by making it possible to develop a first-of-its-kind data-driven clinical decision support system.",Homecare-CONCERN: Building risk models for preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits in homecare,10264874,R01HS027742,[' '],AHRQ,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,369427
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10252902,K08HS027837,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,152581
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10251154,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2021,190266
"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.

We will synthesize and disseminate implementation research and lessons learned of digital healthcare tools with an emphasis on the appropriate, ethical use of AI towards healthcare decision- making, quality whole-person care, and value-based transformation efforts. CHITA will provide a forum for disseminating and catalyzing cross-disciplinary cutting-edge research that links transdisciplinary research communities with policy and practitioners to curate and present user-focused research, exchange ideas, and learn about current policy issues. CHITA also aims to empower the next generation of health IT and analytics researchers through a variety of programming that empowers dozens of students and early career scholars every year, including via a doctoral consortium, presentation opportunities, and engagement with senior researchers, policymakers, patient advocates and practitioners. Entering its 12th installment, each year CHITA convenes over 120 participants representing researchers, policy professionals, patients and practitioners including scientists from approximately 40 universities who present their latest findings. 2021-2023 conference sessions will be tailored to critical AHRQ topics of interest and AHRQ digital health grantees will be encouraged to showcase their work. CHITA is positioned in a unique niche that is not addressed in the same depth by any of the larger health services research conferences. CHITA’s format supports intimate, rich, and detailed interaction and discussion that is often infeasible in large conferences. CHITA enables the development of human capital in a constructive setting. CHITA is exceptionally positioned to continue contributing to the nation’s journey towards a more effective and value-based healthcare system, which uses digital healthcare and AI productively and equitably. Project Narrative The Conference on Health IT and Analytics (CHITA) is an annual research summit, including a doctoral consortium that each year convenes leading scholars and students from more than 40 research institutes, with prominent policy and practitioner speakers and attendees. The conference provides a vibrant setting to foster digital healthcare and AI implementation lessons for dissemination and advance translational research regarding the design, implementation, use, management, and impact of health IT and analytics, with a focus on the ethical and equitable use of artificial intelligence (AI). The conference plays a critical role in facilitating interactions between scholars, government, and industry, fosters a multidisciplinary health IT and analytics research community, nurtures the next generation of health IT and analytics researchers, and supports the national agenda for a learning health system, which promotes evidence-based improvements in healthcare quality, patient safety, whole-person care, affordability and access.",Annual Conference on Health IT & Analytics 2021-2023,10295507,R13HS028541,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R13,2021,50000
"Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the FaceBase III Hub was created by the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to create a data repository to serve the entire community of dental and craniofacial researchers by sharing diverse data related to craniofacial development and dysmorphia, as well as other research communities that can leverage the diverse data that is in the FaceBase repository. One particularly unique and important element of FaceBase III is that it has over 22,000 facial images from over 11,000 human subjects, many of which are labeled with syndromes based on clinical and genomic diagnoses. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. While FaceBase embraces the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, there are unique concerns specific to AI/ML research including: presence of noise, uncertainty of labels, and bias within datasets. It is imperative that we remedy any limitations in the utility of FaceBase’s facial imaging data for AI/ML research. In this project, we propose to unlock the tremendous potential of FaceBase facial scans by identifying gaps in how data is characterized, formated, and preprocessed from the perspective of its use in AI/ML research and algorithm development. To accomplish this, we propose to initiate a pilot application that applies existing deep learning algorithms developed by investigators in this proposal to existing FaseBase data (Aim 1). The goal of the pilot is to identify how curation, organization and preparation of FaceBase data might be improved so as to streamline their use in ML/AI based investigations. Based on what we learn from the pilot, we will modify the current FaceBase self curation processes specifically around Facial Scans (Aim 2). This will require us to streamline our process associated with curation of human subject data, so that we have the necessary rich descriptive elements while maintaining required restrictions on data handling. Ultimately, the goal is to position the FaceBase Hub so that the existing facial scan resources become more broadly useful to AI/ML researchers. More significantly, we expect to see an increased availability with facial scan data and other associated data types, such as genotyping and neurofunctional data. By making the proposed improvements to our data ingest procedures, we anticipate that this proposal will allow FaceBase to scale to significantly larger data set sizes, and consequently, cementing and expanding its position as a unique resource to the broader NIH community of ML and AI researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Craniofacial dysmorphia is one of the leading causes of birth defects, and in recognition, the major goal of the FaceBase III project is to advance research by creating comprehensive datasets of craniofacial development and dysmorphologies and to disseminate these datasets to the wider research NIH research community. FaceBase currently contains many unique data sets that could be leveraged by machine learning and deep learning algorithms. A prime example of this is the extensive collection of 3D facial scans. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. Current FaceBase data collections have not been curated with AI/ML as one of the target use cases. In this proposal, we will use a simple DL pilot to assess gaps in the FaceBase data curation practices and propose solutions to those caps so as to enhance the use of FaceBase data for emerging research based on AI/ML. .",Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets,10412668,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calvaria', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'Correlation Studies', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Facies', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Surgical sutures', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Yang', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'data cleaning', 'data curation', 'data handling', 'data hub', 'data ingestion', 'data repository', 'data submission', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'field study', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'malformation', 'mouse model', 'neural network architecture', 'neurodevelopment', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prototype', 'rapid growth', 'rare genetic disorder', 'repository', 'research and development']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,337557
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,10158473,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,227282
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Secondary to', 'Smoker', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blind', 'computer grid', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'open source', 'personalized management', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10051418,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,627397
"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health.

"A Fully Decentralized Federated Learning Framework for Automated Image Segmentation in Cancer Radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY While the recent surge of artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in various image analysis tasks, their performance in a broad range of clinical environment is largely restricted by the limited generalization capability when being applied to new data, primarily because most models have been generated using data from a single institution or public datasets with limited training data. Aggregating data from different institutions could improve model training, but such centralized data sharing is practically challenging due to various technical, legal, privacy and data ownership barriers. This proposal aims to address these barriers by developing a novel gossip federated learning (GFL) framework to build an effective AI model by learning from different data sources without the need of sharing patient data. As compared to the traditional client/server federated learning such as FedAvg, the proposed framework is fully decentralized in that the models trained in local datasets will directly communicate to each other in a peer-to-peer manner, making our method more robust and efficient. We will develop and evaluate the proposed scheme in the task of automated organ segmentation in CT images for liver and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) because accurate, robust and efficient delineation of those organs at risk (OARs) is a clinically important but technically challenging problem. We hypothesize that the model trained with our framework can achieve segmentation performance not inferior to a model with data pooled from all the resources. The dynamics of our recently created healthcare system mimic a diverse multi-institutional environment, which places us in an ideal setting to systematically evaluate our framework. Our specific aims include: 1) Establish the GFL-based automated OAR segmentation framework, and develop the supporting software infrastructure; 2) Optimize the GFL-based auto- segmentation; 3) Evaluate GFL-based OAR segmentation framework with 400 liver and 400 H&N cancer patients collected from four hospitals within a metropolitan health system. This proposal addresses two key research priorities for NIBIB: machine learning based segmentation and approaches that facilitate interoperability among annotations used in image training databases. The success of this project will substantially increase the number and variety of data for model training without sacrificing the patient privacy, and thus improve the performance and generalization of the segmentation model on new data. We will open-source this framework, which may enable a larger scale of multi-institutional collaboration and could expedite the clinical adoption of AI-driven auto- segmentation in RT. More importantly, this framework provides a flexible and robust solution to the primary barrier of applying AI to the medical domain where learning on multi-institutional data sharing is impeded by patient privacy concerns, and is expected to have a catalytic impact on precision medicine by generalizing it to broader applications within medicine where a model needs to learn across multi-institutional data without sacrificing patient privacy.

The success of this project will enable the development of accurate, consistent and efficient segmentation models trained with massive patient data from different institutions, and will expedite the adoption of AI-driven image segmentation in radiation oncology clinical practice.

"Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem Abstract Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) is a growing multibillion-dollar industry leveraging a wide range of clinical, genomic, social, geographical, web-based, and wearable device data for improvements in health outcomes broadly circumscribed under the term “precision health.” Powered by Big Data, characterized by volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value, “big knowledge” in the form of AI-CDS is becoming increasingly ubiquitous (volume), rapidly developing (velocity), available to a wide range of medical fields (variety), based on data from a wide range of sources that reflects the health of individuals and populations (veracity), and focused on lowering costs and promoting better health outcomes (value). Current policy paradigms for CDS, including whether to classify it as a medical device, are not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence technologies. Patients and providers have no reasonable way to discern how these “black box” technologies operate or their accuracy. Innovative policies (e.g. standards in product labeling) that address these concerns are likely to require direct consumer outreach and communications to ensure public trust in the growing AI-CDS field. Indeed, public trust in AI-CDS has been identified as a top priority for the AI- CDS big knowledge ecosystem by the National Academy of Medicine, NIH, FDA, and OMB, among others. Trust is particularly salient given the range of critical ethical and policy considerations related to transparency, privacy, non-maleficence, equity, accountability, and utility of AI-CDS. In Aim 1 of our proposed study, we will measure the public's current trust in AI-CDS for precision health and assess (a) its relationship to the public's expectations and concerns about privacy, equity, non-maleficence, responsibility, and utility and (b) how it may be affected by policies and practices, such as labeling or certification. In Aim 2 we will use deliberative democracy methods and expert interviews, designed to directly inform policy and standards that address perceived risks of AI-CDS and in Aim 3 we propose to develop a product information label that would both increase transparency and accessibility of information about AI-CDS for patients and providers. The continued acceptance and adoption of AI-CDS is predicated on public trust and our proposal provides a research-focused and evidence-based approach to incorporating public participation into emerging national standards. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed project is to address the gap in current research on public perspectives about ethical best practices and the impact of Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) on the trust of the public. We propose to focus on policy and practice options such as certification, notification, and product labeling related to essential, endemic issues in the AI-CDS ecosystem: transparency, privacy, equity, non- maleficence, accountability, and utility (Aim 1 and Aim 2). For Aim 3, we evaluate key attributes for product labeling and an accompanying multi-dimensional metric of trust reflective of the Food and Drug Administration's system of categorizing software used as a medical device.",Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem,10092723,R01EB030492,"['Academy', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Apple', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Big Data', 'British', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Melissa', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Nonmaleficence', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Product Labeling', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Participation', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deliberative democracy', 'design', 'digital', 'ethical legal social implication', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning network', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'point of care', 'precision oncology', 'preference', 'public trust', 'social', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,700766
"Evolution and optimization of synthetic <READ/WRITE> function from and into cells using genetic programming An immense advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence has transformed many aspects of our lives. The integration of artificial intelligence into the biomedical field allows us to solve complex biological problems that are the bottle neck of developing progressive diagnostic and therapeutic tools. One example is the need to manipulate the amino acid sequence of peptides to improve their function as bioactive molecules. Embarking on these new technologies, we developed a new machine learning tool that is based on a discipline known as “genetic programing” that can assist in designing new proteins and bioactive peptides. This new technology, termed Protein Optimization Evolving Tool (POET), can generate a model that describes the relationship between a peptide and its respective activity. Moreover, through cycles of protein evolution, we can significantly improve the model and consequently generate peptides with substantially improved function.  A major challenge of translating synthetic biology approaches to clinical treatment is the need to improve the communication with biological circuits in vivo. To that end, we will leverage the immense potential of the POET to produce proteins and peptides that can read and write information from and into cells.  Here we seek to improve, test and implement this model into three related, yet, independent aims. In the first aim, we will deploy the POET to develop an ultrasensitive peptide-based imaging agent for MRI based on proton exchange. Our preliminary data shows that through only few cycles of peptide evolution we surpassed the state-of-the-art similar peptides. In the second aim, we intend to use a similar approach to develop a novel MRI imaging probe based on T1 relaxation. We will use a metabolic engineering approach to express and load the peptide with Lanthanides, and the POET algorithm to improve the next generations. Lastly, in the third aim, we will use the POET for discovering new peptides for drug and gene delivery. We will utilize a novel platform for gene/drug delivery to test the efficiency of the peptides.  All three aims will start with computational design of peptides followed by an in vitro testing and several cycles of peptide evolution until the ultimate peptides are identified. All three aims will be ended by demonstration of the utility of those peptides in a clinically relevant question in an in vivo model followed by non-invasive imaging.  We anticipate that this innovative approach will open up a new avenue for developing powerful bioactive peptides and proteins to solve critical biological questions, and for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that can vastly benefit the well-being of numerous patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to combine an innovative machine learning algorithm with synthetic biology approaches to design new proteins that can read and write information from and into cells in vivo and consequently, to improve communication with synthetic biological circuits that precisely control diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Such technology is likely to move the needle towards the next generation of treatment strategies for devastating diseases which currently have a profound negative impact on public health.",Evolution and optimization of synthetic <READ/WRITE> function from and into cells using genetic programming,10101230,R01EB030565,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Gene Delivery', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Neck', 'Needles', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protons', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Whole Organism', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular vesicles', 'feeding', 'imaging agent', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolic engineering', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peptide drug', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic peptide', 'synthetic protein', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579888
"Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients Project Summary/Abstract Advanced machine learning (ML) has consistently been shown to outperform expert opinion and more simple analytics for predicting clinical outcomes. However, there has been a paucity of successful prospective clinical implementations of such tools. The unique barriers to advanced ML implementation and adoption in healthcare are (1) the technological challenges of running and displaying these models in real-time within existing workflows and (2) a general distrust for black box algorithms among highly skilled providers. As a result, the promise of these tools is largely lost in healthcare. This is particularly problematic in COVID-19, where patients can deteriorate rapidly, from appearing stable to suddenly being in respiratory failure or shock with little obvious warning. Early recognition of this deterioration is vital to proactive interventions, which can improve outcomes. eCART is a predictive analytic that has been developed iteratively at the University of Chicago over the past decade to identify hospitalized patients at risk for acute clinical deterioration. A simple (logistic regression based) ML model (eCARTv2) is commercially available within electronic health records on AgileMD’s clinical decision support platform. eCARTv2 was developed in a retrospective multicenter dataset and its use in clinical practice was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction in mortality in a multicenter trial. Our team recently completed development and validation of a gradient boosted machine (GBM) version of the model (eCARTv4), using nearly 100 variables, including trends and interactions. The advanced ML model was significantly more accurate than the simple ML and other models for predicting acute clinical deterioration across all hospital settings, in both septic and non-septic patients as well as in COVID-19 patients. The next challenge is clinically implementing it. The goals of this project are to a) upgrade the existing AgileMD platform to support the previously derived and validated eCARTv4 model and overhaul the human-machine interface for an advanced user experience (UX) that provides, for the first time, interpretable, graphical insight into the contribution of individual variables to a real-time EHR-embedded advanced ML analytic, and b) measure the impact of the new tool on HCP effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. We hypothesize that the combination of high accuracy and interpretability afforded by the advanced ML and UX will result in earlier recognition of acute deterioration as well as increased System Usability Scores (SUS) and usefulness scores in the treatment of deteriorating COVID-19 patients over standard care. Project Narrative Advanced machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve patient outcomes by alerting health care providers to early signs of patient deterioration they may otherwise miss. However, clinical teams have been hesitant to fully embrace these tools because of their black box nature and inability to verify the logic underpinning them. This project intends to give medical staff the transparency they need to confidently leverage sophisticated ML tools to better treat hospitalized patients, particularly those with COVID-19.",Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients,10259197,R44EB030955,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Staff', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Relative Risks', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Running', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'distrust', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake', 'usability']",NIBIB,"AGILEMD, INC.",R44,2021,1995966
"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all.

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10242048,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source tool', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2021,191826
"Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality Project Summary Climate change is the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. While numerous pathways of the health impact of climate change have been proposed, the “climate penalty” effect, i.e., a warming temperature worsens ambient air quality and consequently influences human health, remains poorly understood, resulting in an underestimated public health burden associated with global warming. Our previous epidemiological studies have reported that higher summer mean temperatures and higher PM2.5 concentrations are each associated with increased all-cause mortality in the Medicare population (aged ≥65) in the Southeastern US (SEUS)1, 2. Satellite and ground-based observations suggest a strong dependence of air pollution on interannual variabilities of summer mean temperature in SEUS3. These findings suggest that the indirect health effect of temperature via the climate penalty on air quality can be potentially important in the SEUS region, in addition to the direct adverse effects that we observed. However, clear epidemiological evidence of the air pollution serving as a mediator for the health effects of temperature, and accurate estimate of this effect is still missing in current literature. Herein, drawing on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that rising temperature can indirectly affect all-cause mortality via worsening both PM2.5 and ozone levels in the SEUS. We propose a study that will leverage the Medicare cohort from 2000-2016 (124 million person-years), the largest longitudinal cohort available for the SEUS and the high-resolution temperature, PM2.5, and O3 data, to investigate all-cause mortality in response to the “climate penalty” effect using a mediation statistical analysis. Specifically, in this project we will (1) update the present- day temperature and ozone predictions at 1-km2 grids across the SEUS through 2016 by incorporating ensemble averaging of machine learning models; (2) quantify the health effect of “climate penalty” on all-cause mortality using a mediation analysis, and explore whether mitigating anthropogenic air pollution emissions might serve as a pathway of climate change adaptation; (3) perform a risk assessment on the excess deaths related to the climate penalty on air pollution for the mid- (2050) and late-21st century (2100), using climate model output, chemical transport modeling, along with the top-down estimate of “climate penalty” from Aim 2. The proposed research will improve understanding of the interplays between climate, air pollution, and human health based on real-world big data, and provide epidemiological evidence of an important pathway that climate change adversely affects human health, with immediate relevance to climate and environmental policymaking. Project Narrative This project aims to estimate the health effect of “climate penalty”, i.e., the rising temperature indirectly affects human health via worsening ambient air quality (primarily PM2.5 and ozone levels) using a mediation analysis based on satellite-retrieved exposures and Medicare all-cause mortality. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the indirect health effect of a warming climate by worsening air quality can be a major public health burden of future climate change, and 2) improving air quality by reducing anthropogenic emission can mitigate the health effect of climate penalty. We will also forecast the excess deaths in 2050 and 2100 related to the climate penalty on air pollution using climate model ensembles simulated for different emission scenarios.",Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality,10218738,R21ES032606,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Environmental Policy', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Global Warming', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Weather', 'air pollution control', 'anthropogenesis', 'atmospheric chemistry', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'oxidation', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'resilience', 'response', 'tropospheric ozone', 'ventilation', 'volatile organic compound', 'warm temperature']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,260895
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner.

"Mentoring in Advanced mHealth Technologies and Machine Learning for HIV/Drug Abuse Research Abstract Renewal of my Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24) will allow me to continue my strong efforts directed toward successful original investigations and mentoring to generate research capacity in mobile technologies to improve health (mHealth). The impact of the initial K24 on my mentees has been striking. Since award of the initial K24, nearly two dozen of my mentees, 70% of whom are women or minorities, have been PI on NIH funded studies (under K, R, or Loan Repayment Program mechanisms). The impact the K24 on my own research has been substantial. Since 2014, I have been Principal Investigator (PI) on six federally funded awards: 1) one newly funded 4-year R01 from NIDA; 2) one R56 from NIDA; 3) one two-year R01 from NIDA; 4) one 4-year R01 from NIDA; 5) my K24 from NIDA; and 6) one newly funded 4-year DARPA research award. In addition, I received a William J Fulbright Foreign Scholarship to Malaysia. As my K24 evolved, so has my research focus. My overall research objective is to devote sufficient time to investigate use of next generation (“NextGen”) technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine learning in substance abuse and HIV research. My first research project, Virya, uses “digital phenotyping” with invisible biosensing and machine learning, to identify acute pain exacerbations in HIV+ individuals on opioids, a population at risk for problematic opioid use. The second reseach project uses mobile technologies to diagnose Covid-19 infection in HIV+ persons who inhale cannabis, itself a high-impact topic. Finally, the R01-funded MyTPill project compares the NextGen technology of unobtrusive ingestible biosensors that provide vivid, indisputable measures of medication ingestion. NextGen research discoveries become commercial products, but this process of introducing new discoveries into the healthcare economy remains deeply unfamiliar—yet increasingly important— to academic clinician-scientists. The objective of my Career Development Activities, therefore, involves learning how to navigate regulatory processes, FDA approvals, valuations, venture capital, contracts and intellectual property rights. Because of the growing importance of commercialization of research findings to the health and sustainability of academic careers, my overall mentoring objective of this K24 is to develop researchers who not only have the skills to conduct rigorous NextGen mHealth studies, but also to extend the mass of NIH-funded mHealth research into the healthcare economy. My mentoring approach incorporates several components that contributed to the success of my initial K24: dedicated funding for mentee’s early investigations; outstanding institutional support; several sources of referral of high-quality mentees; and renowned co- mentors who will help me establish a pipeline of mentees that have risen to that “cutting edge” where successful academic careers begin. This proposed K24 renewal, with its focus on NextGen technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine learning, is highly relevant to NIH’s mission because the lessons learned from this substance abuse and HIV research are directly applicable to the care of patients with common, intractable, and expensive conditions. Project Narrative This project focuses on mentoring of junior clinician scientists who will be taken to that cutting edge where successful academic careers begin. Mentoring will be done through several funded and developmental projects that will teach not only how to conduct research but will also introduce mentees to the processes of commercialization of new discoveries.",Mentoring in Advanced mHealth Technologies and Machine Learning for HIV/Drug Abuse Research,10258162,K24DA037109,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'Cannabis', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Exhalation', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Inhalation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intellectual Property', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Music', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nociception', 'Opioid', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property Rights', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rewards', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Wrist', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'magnetic field', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'nasal swab', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid use', 'personal protective equipment', 'pill', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse prevention', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'therapy development', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,193571
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,10098312,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implementation facilitators', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,552775
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,10118152,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic opioid', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2021,188616
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder. This lapse prediction model will be integrated into an existing, validated mHealth app to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.",Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping,10172881,R01DA047315,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Narcotics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Opioid', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'addiction', 'alcohol testing', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'chronic pain', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug abstinence', 'experience', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'mobile application', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'real time model', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'rural setting', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'sobriety', 'social media', 'stressor', 'substance use', 'substance user', 'suburb']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,683287
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: NIDA Summer Research Internship Program PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders.

"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society. Understanding the psychophysiological factors that interact with disrupted neurobiological systems resulting in increased negative affect could clarify drug addiction trajectories and apply this knowledge to the development of digital therapeutics in mHealth.",HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network,10354615,UG1DA049467,"['Abstinence', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Faculty', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysiology', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Veronica', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Writing', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'digital treatment', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'implementation science', 'indexing', 'mHealth', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'new technology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'parent grant', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'stress reactivity', 'substance misuse', 'substance use', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2021,70982
"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,10209530,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Home environment', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'substance use', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment research', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2021,840913
"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO.

"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10339079,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Data', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Workplace', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10190881,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'black patient', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,179582
"Increasing Peer Support for OUD Recovery during COVID-19 through Digital Health: A National Randomized Controlled Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Increasing numbers of opioid overdoses have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely reflecting the pandemic’s multiple effects on this already vulnerable population. People in recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) have reported disproportionate psychosocial distress and isolation, as well as significant disruptions in access to treatment including peer support, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are especially acute for rural, low-income, and minority populations in recovery from OUD. Peer support is a key component of many evidence-based OUD recovery programs: it improves recovery capital, improves treatment engagement, improves perceived social support, and reduces psychosocial distress, particularly when used in conjunction with other evidence-based treatments such as medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). This grant, submitted in response to PA 20-237, therefore proposes a randomized controlled trial of a novel mobile peer support app platform among a national sample of 1300 patients in recovery from opioid use disorders (OUDs), as an adjunct to usual care, during COVID-19. Our previously piloted online-only recruitment and follow- up strategy – in which we meld patient-reported outcomes with administrative datasets – allows strategic recruitment of often-excluded participants from across the United States, including those facing the highest barriers to treatment. The mobile app-based peer support intervention, provided as an individual-level enhancement of existing treatment and recovery programs, will allow individuals in OUD recovery to access a tailored, anonymous, peer-moderated support group 24/7. The app is augmented with natural language processing tools capable of automatically ‘flagging’ critical or clinically relevant content, thereby creating a scalable system to keep groups safe and constructive. Participants will be followed for 6 months through both self-report and administrative outcomes. The study’s primary outcome is self-reported recovery capital, complemented by objectively measured administrative data on retention in treatment programs from our community and governmental partners in a sub-sample of 650 patients from RI and IN. Hypothesized secondary outcomes are mitigation of psychosocial effects of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population, including depressive symptoms, stress, and loneliness, as well as objective adverse events of emergency department visits and opioid overdoses. Finally, we will explore whether state- and county-level variables moderate efficacy. SIGNIFICANCE: OUD is a major public health problem, and patients in recovery from OUD are experiencing worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. If this mobile app demonstrates efficacy among a large national sample of patients, it has the potential to augment existing treatment programs, improve recovery capital, and reduce disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic puts individuals recovering from opioid use disorders (OUDs), an already vulnerable population, at increased risk of overdose due to decreased access to treatment, decreased social support, and increased psychosocial stress. This proposal will test the efficacy of a promising mobile app-based peer support program, compared to usual care, in increasing recovery capital, improving retention in treatment, and reducing psychosocial adverse effects, among a national sample of people in recovery from OUD. If effective, it would provide an accessible, personalized, and scalable approach to OUD recovery increasingly needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Increasing Peer Support for OUD Recovery during COVID-19 through Digital Health: A National Randomized Controlled Trial,10308885,R01DA054698,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Advertisements', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Buprenorphine', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Capital', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Facebook', 'Geography', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Loneliness', 'Low income', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Treatment/Psychosocial Effects', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'administrative database', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital health', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'pandemic disease', 'peer', 'peer support', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary endpoint', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'social group', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'substance use', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,441303
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,485426
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'screening services', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Black scientists are underrepresented in health-related research fields and women from racial and ethnic minority groups face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond. The goal of this supplement, consistent with the priorities of NIH, is to address this gap and promote diversity in behavioral and biomedical health research by providing support for Ibukun E. Fowe, a Public Health PhD student in the department of Health Systems and Policy at the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health and member of an underrepresented group in health-related sciences, to gain experience conducting research in the area of understanding older adults’ adherence to technology-based interventions to measure and support health behaviors, including behaviors that predict or prevent cognitive impairment.

"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk.

"Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients’ cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients’ health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application – namely Neuro-World – composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team’s industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system’s ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients’ cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients’ to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients’ compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging. Serious games have received great interests from researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can complement the conventional therapeutic programs to help assess and rehabilitate patients' functional impairments in many environments (e.g., clinics, long-term care facilities, patients' homes). In this project, we propose to develop a human-centered mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the self-administrate serious game-based training in patients with MCI outside the clinic.",Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,10190616,R21AG071988,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Self Administration', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Games', 'base', 'behavior change', 'caregiver education', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive training', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'functional disability', 'group intervention', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'personalized management', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychological distress', 'recruit', 'rural area', 'selective attention', 'side effect', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'treatment as usual', 'underserved area', 'usability']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2021,436836
"Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with Alzheimer’s disease & related dementia (ADRD) experience 400,000 avoidable hospitalizations annually, amounting to $5.4 billion in preventable healthcare costs. In addition to financial costs, avoidable hospitalizations increase risks for adverse outcomes, such as secondary infections, deliriums, or acute distress. To prevent hospitalizations, clinicians rely on caregivers of patients with ADRD to report any physical, behavioral, and emotional changes that caregivers observe. If communicated in a timely manner, many such changes can be addressed without hospitalization, but through pharmacological interventions, home visits, or clinic visits. Currently, communication between clinicians and family caregivers depends on the caregiver knowing when to call, and clinicians sorting through messages of various importance to find and address worrisome changes associated with an impending hospitalization. This strategy is insufficient, as it delays communication of potentially significant changes in patients with ADRD to the clinician. It also relies on caregivers’ ability to distinguish innocuous changes from those that can lead to hospitalizations. To minimize occurrence of avoidable hospitalizations in patients with ADRD, we will develop and test the first remote patient-monitoring platform, Digital Outpost, based on caregiver-reported information. The platform will contain two parts: the native Caregiver App and web-based Clinician Action Dashboard. Guided by user-centered design principles and rapid qualitative research methods, we will query 12 caregivers of patients with ADRD regarding content, look, feel, and experience of the Caregiver App. Using input of 20 clinicians through Delphi and discrete choice methodology, we will define the daily clinical surveys through which caregivers will report physical, behavioral, and emotional changes in patients with ADRD. We will also define the algorithms for analyzing and displaying caregiver-reported data in the Clinician Action Dashboard. Then, we will develop the supporting platform prototype using Agile/Kanban-based Software Development methodology and conduct a 14-day pilot study of Digital Outpost with ten primary caregivers of patients with moderate ADRD. Primary outcome of the pilot will be usability, measured by the System Usability Scale, with a follow-up assessment through rapid qualitative methods. Secondary outcome will be feasibility, measured through platform usage statistics. Upon completion, we will be poised to update the platform to include integration of other smartphone data (e.g. walking steps), use a machine-learning based predictive algorithm for hospitalization, and test efficacy of Digital Outpost in reducing all-cause hospitalization through multi-site trial in a Phase II STTR application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias experience unnecessary trips to the hospital. There is a need to create an effective method for clinicians to monitor patient and caregiver wellbeing at home so clinicians can intervene prior to the need for hospital care. To address this need, we will develop and test the prototype of “Digital Outpost”, the first low-cost, commercially-viable remote patient monitoring platform specifically designed to engage caregivers of patients with ADRD to improve patient and caregiver wellbeing while saving health systems costs and keeping patients in their own home.",Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease,10253642,R41AG072943,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distress', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Financial cost', 'Fright', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Home', 'Home visitation', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical emergency', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'adverse drug reaction', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'emotional symptom', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'family support', 'follow up assessment', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-site trial', 'physical symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'product development', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'secondary infection', 'secondary outcome', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"PREPPED HEALTH, LLC",R41,2021,299782

"The Long-Run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden Among US Elderly and Disabled Adults OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Long-run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden among US Elderly and Disabled Adults Natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity in recent decades, a trend projected to intensify under climate change. The risks these disasters pose to individual health and well-being are heightened among older adults with age-related disabilities or chronic illness, such as those living with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Public policies regarding disaster preparedness and response serve an important role in avoiding or reducing the health impacts of disasters and improving individual health resiliency. The optimal design of these policies depends crucially on quantifying the short- and long-run health risks imposed by disasters, precisely identifying the most vulnerable populations, and understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive and mediate outcomes. However, much remains unknown about these important dimensions. This project will use individual-level administrative Medicare data on all elderly (65+) and long-term disabled beneficiaries from 1992– 2017 to estimate the short- and long-run effects of a broad range of natural disasters – such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods – on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly. The study will compile a comprehensive and spatially detailed database of US natural disasters from a variety of data sources. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit ZIP code of residence, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of victims more precisely than prior research. The project will track individuals living in disaster-affected areas before the disaster regardless of where they move, and a control group of unaffected elderly will be used to establish how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of the event. The project will also use a new machine learning approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations based on individual health characteristics (e.g., pre-existing chronic conditions), demographic traits (e.g., age, race, sex), and local economic and public health circumstances (e.g., per capita income, prevalence of obesity, community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System). The project will also assess several continuity-of-care mechanisms that could moderate or exacerbate post-disaster mortality and disease impacts, including damage to health care facilities, loss of access to one’s physician, and health plan network restrictions. This analysis will be performed for the whole population of beneficiaries and for subpopulations thought to be particularly vulnerable to continuity-of-care disruptions, like adults with multiple pre-existing chronic conditions. Finally, the project will estimate the extent to which certain characteristics (e.g., health care availability, local government expenditure, and healthy behaviors) in areas where victims relocate to following a disaster can explain their health outcomes. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This project will use individual-level administrative Medicare data to estimate the short- and long-run effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly and people with long-term disabilities. The project will also assess several mechanisms that could moderate or exacerbate post-disaster mortality and disease impacts, including disruptions in continuity-of-care and characteristics in areas to which victims relocate following a disaster.",The Long-Run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden Among US Elderly and Disabled Adults,10280272,R01AG073365,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Participation', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exhibits', 'Expenditure', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hurricane', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid eligibility', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Tornadoes', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'climate change', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'hazard', 'health care availability', 'health plan', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'residence', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'trait', 'treatment group', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2021,326712
"Design, Development, and Validation of an AI-enabled Legal Planning and Financial Management Training Solution for ADRD Caregivers PROJECT ABSTRACT More than 16 million caregivers (‘family members or friends’) of people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) face serious challenges in providing care. ADRD caregivers are frequently tasked with substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning, and they face increased financial risk and strain as a result. Currently, there is no widely available web-based financial and legal training that can be personalized to meet caregivers’ specific needs. During this Fast Track project, we will begin with a deep discovery of legal planning and financial management needs of ADRD caregivers, conduct participatory co- design sessions with diverse caregivers groups, create multimedia training solutions, design an AI-enabled recommender system to match caregivers with the right training content, and then conduct rolling field trials with a diverse groups of caregivers to confirm the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of our legal planning and financial management training solution. Looking ahead to Phase 3, we expect our solution will support financial stability through delivery of personalized and actionable training for estate planning and financial management needs. We anticipate a combination of B2B partnerships and B2C strategies will yield a sustainable revenue model for our caregiver training solution. PROJECT SUMMARY ADRD caregivers face substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning tasks, which can increase financial strain and emotional stress. During this Fast Track project, we will conduct deep discovery of legal planning and financial management needs of ADRD caregivers and field test an AI-enabled solution. We anticipate our solution approach will support financial stability through delivery of personalized and actionable training, reduce caregiver stress, and potentially improve quality of life within the care partnership.","Design, Development, and Validation of an AI-enabled Legal Planning and Financial Management Training Solution for ADRD Caregivers",10301832,R44AG074128,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Businesses', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional Stress', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial Support', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'Occupational activity of managing finances', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver education', 'caregiving', 'commercialization', 'dementia care', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'family support', 'feasibility testing', 'feature selection', 'field study', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'socioeconomics', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIA,"WHIPLASH TECHNOLOGY, INC.",R44,2021,299462
"Use of a Novel Toilet Seat to Passively Collect Digital Biomarkers in Assisted Living Settings ABSTRACT In senior living facilities, some of the most common health related problems stem from the GI tract and urinary system including Clostridium difficile Infections (CDI), Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), Constipation and Colon Cancer. The best way to lower costs and treat these conditions effectively is early diagnosis and treatment. Current clinical management for these conditions, as well as many others, include monitoring of specific excreta characteristics including urine color, urination frequency, urine duration, stool color, stool frequency and stool consistency. These logs are the best tool doctors currently have to screen for conditions such as UTIs, infectious diarrhea, dehydration, chronic kidney disease, GI bleeding, GU surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and constipation, that can lead to hospitalizations and readmissions. However, these logs are on average 61% inaccurate at reporting adverse episodes such as diarrhea. Toi Labs has developed the patented TrueLoo technology to take pictures of excreta and, using machine learning algorithms, classify the toileting event using Digital Biomarkers (DBMs). The ability to create an excreta log to accurately deliver detailed information to doctors and healthcare providers can revolutionize healthcare by notifying when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. This novel, low-cost approach of machine learning and image identification technology that requires no change in behavior of the user will enable currently undetectable links between medical records and specific excreta patterns. In the future, the machine learning algorithm may be able to determine links between these excreta logs and the onset of specific diseases. In this study we will be collecting manual excreta records and automated TrueLoo digital excreta records in memory care and assisted living facilities, and compare them against each other and against patients’ deidentified medical records. We will determine correlative data between excreta logs and adverse events to establish conditional threshold for each type of adverse event and, using ML, try and establish individual conditional thresholds for reporting to caregiving staff. We will compare the manual and digital logs to assess the difference between speed of adverse episode identification when using TrueLoo as compared to manual logs. NARRATIVE (max 3 sentences) Assisted living facilities and memory care facilities have a high rate of health problems stemming from GI tract and urinary system issues including diarrhea, constipation, urinary tract infections, and colon cancer to name a few. The ability to create a digital bowel movement and urine log to accurately inform doctors and healthcare providers detailed and correct information can revolutionize healthcare by providing information on when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. Toi Labs has created TrueLoo, a specialized toilet seat, that captures images to log the bathroom session and is building a computer algorithm to determine links between toilet logs and the onset of diseases.",Use of a Novel Toilet Seat to Passively Collect Digital Biomarkers in Assisted Living Settings,10325655,R43AG074812,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Constipation', 'Coprophagia', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defecation', 'Dehydration', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Fecal Impaction', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reference Values', 'Reporting', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Urinary system', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'caregiving', 'clinical decision-making', 'community living', 'cost', 'detection method', 'digital', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'hospital readmission', 'infection rate', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'memory care', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'residence', 'resistant strain', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NIA,"TOI LABS, INC.",R43,2021,299676

"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,10248288,R21AR076612,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antiphospholipid Antibodies', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement Activation', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial cost', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'France', 'Future', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor', 'Maternal Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention trial', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salmon', 'Schedule', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Carolina', 'Statistical Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maternal risk', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multi-ethnic', 'multi-racial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal death', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R21,2021,185269
"Impact of Registry Use on Quality and Outcomes in Rheumatology (QORA) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The American College of Rheumatology launched the RISE registry in 2014. RISE is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) that passively collects data from the EHRs of participating providers, aggregates and analyzes data centrally and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. RISE has grown into one of the largest rheumatology registries in the world, with 2 million patients with 20 million encounters. However, research is needed to quantify RISE's impact on quality and outcomes and to explore the specific mechanisms by which its health IT infrastructure influences clinical practice. The proposed study will employ a mixed methods approach to examine variations in use of the RISE registry web-based dashboard and explore the consequences of this variation on quality of care and clinical outcomes. We will focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common inflammatory arthritis affecting 1.3 million Americans, and an area with several nationally-endorsed quality measures. Our central hypothesis is that participation and active engagement with the data and tools available on the RISE dashboard leads to improvements in quality and outcomes over time. The proposed Impact of Registry Use on Quality and Outcomes in Rheumatology (QORA) project aims include 1) analyzing physician and practice-level variation in patterns of RISE dashboard use by analyzing the extensive audit-log data in the RISE data warehouse; 2) investigating the impact of participation and engagement with the RISE registry on quality of care and clinical outcomes, and 3) identifying strategies for redesigning tools available on the RISE dashboard to improve its usability and its effectiveness for local quality improvement. For this last aim, we will perform a series of semi-structured interviews and field observations with users of RISE in different rheumatology practice settings and work with a team of human-centered design experts. The proposed work will allow us to generate evidence to improve RISE and maximize its impact on quality of care and outcomes for people with rheumatic diseases. The study will also generate data to support a core public health priority for NIAMS: improving the quality of rheumatologic care delivery in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE national patient registry has broken new ground in connecting rheumatology practices around the country in a large data network, measuring quality, and providing continuous feedback on clinical performance. The proposed study will generate scientific evidence to establish the impact of RISE on clinical outcomes, while at the same time helping us understand the mechanisms of its impact through the in-depth study of registry dashboard use patterns and qualitative studies with stakeholders. Data generated through this research will inform improvements to RISE that maximize its impact on health outcomes for people with rheumatic diseases.",Impact of Registry Use on Quality and Outcomes in Rheumatology (QORA),10281061,R01AR079566,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'dashboard', 'data registry', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'health care quality', 'health disparity', 'health record', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'payment', 'practice setting', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,709613
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals.

"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"dkNET Coordinating Unit: An information network for FAIR resources and data Project Summary We outline plans for the next generation NIDDK Information Network (dkNET), a centralized portal for discovery and information about research resources-data, reagents, organisms, tools available to researchers through NIDDK-supported centers and other relevant projects. In this phase, we will continue to support and maintain aggregated data from biomedical databases. But since the launch of dkNET in 2012, the data and resource landscape has changed, there are new concerns about rigor and reproducibility, and we are seeing data mandates and increased demand for data and data services. We will therefore capitalize upon our considerable success in developing and deploying Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs), a system for identifying, tracking and aggregating data about research resources in the literature currently used in over 350 journals. RRIDs are unique identifiers assigned to individual research resources and form the basis of a citation and tracking system for use within the scientific literature. Through RRIDs, we will further develop our Resource Information Network, including analytics tools, to help researchers not only to identify appropriate resources, but to provide them with up to date information about the use and performance of these resources. We will also develop services in support of NIH's new rigor and reproducibility guidelines to help researchers develop plans to identify and validate research resources and help support centers in tracking use of their products. In response to user feedback and new NIH mandates and recommendations for data management and sharing, we will also add new services and tools in support of data science. During this past phase, the PI's helped develop the FAIR principles, recommendations for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Major data initiatives in both the US and Europe are now supporting FAIR. Full implementation of FAIR requires that the community have a way to develop and disseminate best practices and standards for metadata, data formats, etc. NIDDK is uniquely poised to help coordinate and accelerate this process for NIDDK supported researchers. We believe to gain support for proper data management and data publishing, it is important not just to provide help in compliance, but to provide tools and services for integrating and analyzing FAIR data to address critical questions. In conjunction with the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP, formerly the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas, or NURSA), we will develop a new meta-analysis platform for FAIR `omics data. Through the application of biocuration and consensomic analysis of NIDDK-funded and relevant `omics data assets, dkNET users will have access to a user-friendly but powerful platform for modeling signaling events in metabolic organs and intersections between cellular signaling pathways and metabolic disease. These capabilities will be accompanied by an aggressive and extensive outreach and dissemination plan to help broaden awareness of and use of dkNET and NIDDK-supported centers. Project Narrative In order to assist in navigating the growing resource information landscape we will build on the foundation provided by dkNET to provide tools and services to researchers, clinicians, funders, and publishers in support of NIH's new rigor and reproducibility guidelines and of the FAIR principles for data resources.",dkNET Coordinating Unit: An information network for FAIR resources and data,10222656,U24DK097771,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Infrastructure', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'body system', 'cloud based', 'dashboard', 'data format', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'indexing', 'metadata standards', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,980811
"Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes SUMMARY The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth <37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge “transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations. The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the cornerstone of nutrition policy in the U.S., impacting WIC and other Federal nutrition assistance programs, health insurance incentives, weight and lifestyle interventions, policies to change the food environment, and nutrition education programs at the national, regional, state and local levels. This project will inform the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines by using cutting-edge analytic approaches to identify diet patterns that promote healthy outcomes of pregnancy. Although the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial, we focus on dietary intake because it is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and has important implications for mother and child well beyond the childbearing years.",Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes,10232384,R01HD102313,"['Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Area', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Congresses', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incentives', 'Infant Mortality', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Nulliparity', 'Nutrition Policy', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Oils', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'dietary', 'dietary control', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'food environment', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health of the mother', 'healthy pregnancy', 'improved', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'nutrition', 'nutrition education', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'synergism', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,620565
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) in the United States, more than 33 million cases have been confirmed, and the death toll has climbed to over 600,000 persons. The Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRs) are located in diverse areas of the US, serving rural populations as well as other underserved groups, including Native Americans, Hispanic individuals, and persons of color. Many states served by IDeA-CTRs have been among those hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) has been established by the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) as a centralized national data resource for the study of COVID- 19. Over the past year, the 8 IDeA-CTRs participating in National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) have contributed electronic health record (EHR) data on more than 175,000 individuals infected with SARS-COV-2. IDeA-CTR investigators have led multiple N3C Domain Teams, participated in many data projects, and engaged more than 150 IDeA state investigators across the US. Moreover, N3C has served as a stimulus for the IDeA CTRs to work as a highly collaborative network. IDeA CTRs are now well poised to build on this experience to enable inclusion of EHRs from additional areas of the United States, broaden engagement of diverse investigators throughout IDeA states, and most importantly, to drive science relevant to minority and underserved IDeA state populations with communication of results to those communities. We will accomplish these broad objectives through the following aims: Aim 1 - Build IDeA-CTR infrastructure to organize collaboration among IDeA CTRs for purposes of driving relevant science; AIM 2 - Expand IDeA-CTR data contributions to N3C, thereby, increasing representation of minority, rural, and other underserved populations in the N3C dataset; Aim 3 - Provide the necessary analytic support to conduct cutting-edge big data research using a range of techniques, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), to answer important research questions regarding impact of SARS-CoV-2 in IDeA states; and Aim 4 - Actively engage investigators in IDeA states to enable conduct of high quality COVID-19 data projects (through N3C) relevant to populations in their respective states while facilitating investigator development. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) has been established by the National Institutes of Health as a centralized national data resource for the study of COVID-19. Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRs) are well poised to build on their previous N3C experience to enable inclusion of electronic health records from additional areas of the United States, broaden engagement of diverse investigators throughout IDeA states, and most importantly, to drive science relevant to minority and underserved IDeA state populations.",West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research,10435710,U54GM104942,"['2019-nCoV', 'Appalachian Region', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'District Hospitals', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical center', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Native Americans', 'Network Infrastructure', 'New England', 'North Dakota', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Puerto Rico', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'West Virginia', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'data resource', 'data submission', 'experience', 'improved', 'investigator training', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'operation', 'programs', 'research study']",NIGMS,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,750000
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving.

"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,10206145,R01HD107493,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'supplemental oxygen']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,640901
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300
"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabidiol', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intoxication', 'Isoflurophate', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Observer Variation', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'acquired epilepsy', 'automated algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical research', 'screening', 'tool', 'valproate']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomic diversity', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759

"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Education', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Reports', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Molecular', 'National Research Council', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anxious', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'broadening participation research', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'price lists', 'protein folding', 'service providers', 'supercomputer', 'uptake', 'web portal']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",10149406,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Poverty', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'substance use', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,367436
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical

"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health priorities. AMR is thought to be re- sponsible for more than 35,000 deaths in the US with a projection of 300 million deaths worldwide by 2050. My original K24 application sought to increase my ability to conduct patient oriented research (POR) on antibiotic resistance and mentor a new generation of clinicians scientists on different aspects of this important public health threat. With support from the K24 award, I was able to markedly increase my research portfolio, launch a microbial genomics mission and increase my mentoring activities. Thus, the overarching goal of this com- petitive K24 renewal is to fully transition to an established investigator by continuing and further strengthening my POR portfolio and mentoring abilities. I also aim to fortify my leadership skills to expand an ambitious re- search and training program, focused on AMR. Supported in part by my original K24 award, I founded the Cen- ter for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG) at UTHealth. The vision of CARMiG was to amalgamate the world-class expertise available in the Houston’s Texas Medical Center (TMC) to serve as a major platform for cutting edge research programs and integrate a training mission to the highest level. I also led the creation of the Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance (GCC-AMR), an inter-institutional hub for AMR researchers across the TMC to interact and foster collaborations. We developed a robust training program on AMR, recruiting and supporting the career of a diverse pool of trainees (MD, PhDs and PharmDs) at different stages of their careers. My trainees have secured 4 NIH K developments awards (2 with perfect scores), and equivalent independent grants. Furthermore, the number of trainee’s publications has markedly expanded (94 publications as firs/corresponding author). Our NIH grant portfolio also grew with more than $ 20 million brought in as PI of NIH grants in the last 5 years, including a recent P01 program ($11m). We were also able to secure the first post-doctoral inter-institutional T32 training program on AMR. Thus, the foundations of my initial K24 program put me in an ideal position to sustain and further strengthen my research and training objectives. In my original K24 program I focused on the clinical and genomic aspects of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Using the expertise acquired in VRE, my K24 renewal will support new areas of research, including the intersection of microbiome science and AMR, genomics and molecular epidemiology of Gram-negative pathogens and use of machine learning to es- tablish clinical/genomic correlates in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The spe- cific aims are: i) strengthen my portfolio of POR related to AMR as the foundation for trainees to develop their careers, and ii) mentor talented young investigators in translational and POR focused on AMR. I plan to con- tinue my robust mentoring program that integrates the understanding of the molecular and genomic bases of resistance and their translation into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a top public-health priority. Training the next generation of clinician scientists and translational scholars is critical to tackle the dire consequences of AMR. After building a successful patient-oriented and translational program on AMR with a major training component, I plan to leverage these resources to expand my training, research and leadership capabilities in AMR, contributing to solve this major public health crisis.",POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms,10301971,K24AI121296,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Basic Science', 'Cefazolin', 'Cell membrane', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Pharmacy', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enterococcus', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Names', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposition', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Sepsis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United Nations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'Vision', 'academic standard', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commensal microbes', 'feasibility testing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gulf coast', 'host microbiota', 'infection management', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'rapid test', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'strength training', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K24,2021,125366
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments,10141226,K01DK121866,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Anti-Cholinergics', 'Benign', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Botox', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nocturia', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Residual volume', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Human Experimentation', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urinary Retention', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urodynamics', 'Urology', 'Woman', 'alpha Toxin', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mathematical model', 'micturition urgency', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,K01,2021,137785
"Maximizing Investigator's Research Award:  Diversifying the Scientific Workforce PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a Maximizing Investigator's Research Award (MIRA) submitted by Professor Mary (Molly) Carnes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dr. Carnes' research program focuses on diversifying the scientific workforce. She has consistently taken a systems approach, conducting action research with multi-tiered interventions at the individual and institutional level. With funding from NIGMS since 2009, her research has focused on the myriad ways cultural stereotypes impede the entry, persistence, and advancement of all women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minority men and women in academic medicine, science, and engineering. Often outside of conscious awareness, stereotypes can shape the decisions of those in the scientific workforce who determine who to fund, mentor, admit or hire and also influence potential scientists-to-be, who need to determine whether a career in science is right for them and whether they “fit” in the scientific workforce. Hallmarks of Dr. Carnes' research have been deploying methods appropriate to the research question (experimental, quasi-experimental, and qualitative), engaging researchers from multiple other disciplines (e.g., sociology, psychology, education, systems engineering, linguistics, public health, computer science), developing and testing theoretically-informed interventions, translating evidence-based strategies into practice, and studying the impact of implementation. Approaching unconscious (“implicit”) stereotype-based bias as a habit, Dr. Carnes' team developed and experimentally verified the first effective intervention to help faculty break the gender bias habit (with subsequent improvement in department climate and greater diversity in hiring), created an interactive video game that addresses implicit race bias in graduate school, performed the first text analysis of R01 critiques and found paradoxically worse scores with greater verbal acclamation for women's vs. men's R01 renewals, and constructed and videorecorded authentic NIH study sections to analyze verbal and non-verbal discourse among reviewers to identify patterns that may be consequential to the outcome of an R01 peer review. MIRA would continue the momentum of Dr. Carnes' research program by providing the opportunity to broaden the habit-breaking workshop intervention to include race and other group bias and test its effectiveness beyond a single site, and continue to use text mining to probe for implicit gender and race bias in gatekeeping evaluations (e.g, reviews of manuscripts and K awards). MIRA would also capitalize on the datasets compiled through Dr. Carnes' research program which include 5 waves of the Study of Faculty Worklife at UW-Madison with retained identifiers, >5,000 R01 Summary Statements from investigators' awarded in 2010-2014, 15 hours of videorecording of expert scientists discussing R01 proposals in simulated study sections, and transcribed interviews with >40 experienced NIH reviewers. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) If the U.S. is to maintain its economic vitality in a world that is increasingly knowledge-based, it cannot afford to lose the contribution of any talented mind to its research enterprise. The research supported by this grant will be devoted to diversifying the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce.",Maximizing Investigator's Research Award:  Diversifying the Scientific Workforce,10132746,R35GM122557,"['Action Research', 'Address', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biomedical Research', 'Climate', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Consequentialism', 'Critiques', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gatekeeping', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Linguistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mollies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Bias', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sociology', 'Stereotyping', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Video Games', 'Video Recording', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'men', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'text searching']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R35,2021,334500
"DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) are characterized by a localized dilation and thinning of the blood vessel, and although they only affect 6% of the population, bleeding from them accounts for about 25% of cerebrovascular deaths. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes one of the most lethal types of hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage-SAH. Despite improvements in SAH management, mortality and morbidity rates remain high, largely due to delayed ischemic complications. Although symptomatic in up to 40%, because of its severe consequences and because we cannot identify who will develop spasm, all patients are subject to extensive monitoring protocols, entailing enormous resources and additional risk for monitoring and treatment.  This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics, integrating quantitative angiography, non-invasive imaging, and clinical data, to improve outcomes for patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage by providing real time patient-specific guidance. Our central hypothesis is that angiographic parametric imaging (API) hemodynamic biomarkers correlate with vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which are associated with poor outcomes in delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). API provides a set of maps of image-biomarkers that may be combined with patient-specific clinical information to robustly predict poor outcomes due to DCI. The proposal’s objective is to develop, standardize, and validate a diagnostic pipeline that uses image-based biomarkers and patient characteristics to predict patient-specific risk of developing DCI, as well as functional and cognitive outcomes.  Our application is significant since there is currently no reliable way to predict DCI early in a patient’s course, and reliable predictions could help to guide therapy and resource allocation. To achieve this, we propose two aims. In the first aim, we will expand on prior work using a machine learning framework to predict which patients are at lowest risk of developing DCI. In aim two we will develop tools to extend predictions to functional and cognitive outcomes. If successful, this will be one of the first machine learning applications to produce an integrated prediction tool that allows clinicians to modify treatment plans in real time to reduce patient risk and resource utilization. This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics using quantitative angiography to identify vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which can be used to predict at a patient- specific level who is at highest and lowest risk of poor outcomes due to delayed cerebral ischemia.",DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE,10288178,R21NS123478,"['Affect', 'Angiography', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Source', 'Spasm', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vasospasm', 'Work', 'cerebrovascular', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'non-invasive imaging', 'parametric imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NINDS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2021,251625
"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder. The project supports the goals of strategy 2.2 of NIMH Strategic Research priorities by creating predictive algorithms at the individual level (what is an individual’s digital signature like, and how well does deviation from that signature predict an event?)",Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder,10217550,R21MH123849,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'International', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Property', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinically relevant', 'data modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disability', 'efficacious treatment', 'heart rate variability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'individual variation', 'mHealth', 'mood regulation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'suicidal risk', 'telemonitoring', 'tool']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R21,2021,136658
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'metadata standards', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback,10264082,R34MH125037,"['Academy', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Competence', 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Cost Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family psychotherapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Youth', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care seeking', 'community based care', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'dashboard', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'poor communities', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'service delivery', 'skills', 'social disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment planning', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R34,2021,332659
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment Abstract Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability. Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss. An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning (RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’ response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults, provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration, and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources. Project Narrative The obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems, and existing gold standard behavioral weight loss treatments are highly expensive to implement due to their intensive, long-term nature and the highly trained clinicians required to deliver treatment. Approaches to decreasing costs (e.g., low intensity treatments, coaching by paraprofessionals rather than experts) have been implemented with moderate success, but weight losses are not consistent across different cost-saving approaches, suggesting that individuals may be best served when they are matched to the type of treatment they need, and when the resources matched to individuals are continuously adapted as their needs change. The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that continuously adjusts features of weight loss coaching including modality and coach skill level.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment,10210830,R01DK125641,"['Accelerometer', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Binge Eating', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insurance', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning progression', 'medication compliance', 'overweight adults', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'remote delivery', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment responders', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,634165
"Obesity Health Disparities Research PRIDE Program (OHD PRIDE) ABSTRACT  There is an urgent need to leverage existing scholarly data to develop data-informed interventions to reduce health disparities. Stakeholders associated with the production and use of data have developed a set of principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperative, and reusable (FAIR). The FAIR guiding principles can facilitate biomedical advancements by bolstering data labeling and management practices to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations. The application of FAIR addresses challenges associated with data annotation and management and can support greater efficiency and effectiveness of data used in this area. Adding training to the FAIR principles to early-career faculty members from groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences will bolster a diverse scientific workforce capable of understanding and redressing cardiovascular health disparities, such as disparities in obesity and related areas crucial to minority health in the FAIR principles. The three aims of the proposed project are to (1) apply an Educational Design Research approach to the development, refinement, and finalization of online training modules for biomedical scientists to enhance their knowledge and skills in the competencies needed to make research data FAIR and AI/ML-ready; (2) assemble a multi-disciplinary advisory committee consisting of ethicists, legal scholars, policy analysts, biomedical investigators, data scientists, and learning designers to provide feedback; and (3) conduct formative and summative assessments. The training modules developed and tested in the proposed project can inform the development of data-informed interventions to prevent obesity, mitigate its current high rates, and slow their projected rise as crucial steps in reducing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE FAIR guiding principles can bolster data labeling and management practices to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations. The integration of FAIR principles training modules into research training and mentoring program for investigators from underrepresented backgrounds can inform and facilitate the development of data-informed interventions that can reduce health disparities.",Obesity Health Disparities Research PRIDE Program (OHD PRIDE),10405988,R25HL126145,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Certification', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethicists', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority Groups', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular health', 'career', 'design', 'digital', 'early-career faculty', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity prevention', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'programs', 'recruit', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'skills training', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'support network']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R25,2021,82221
"Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD Project Summary Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP. Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders. Project Narrative Nearly half of patients do not recover following the first line of treatment for OCD, exposure and response prevention (ERP). This study proposes to test a novel method of augmenting ERP, a computerized, scalable intervention targeting interpretation bias, which is a critical mechanism underlying OCD. The overall goal is to contribute to the development of technology-driven augmentations to ERP to enhance response rates, which may generalize to treatment for other OC-related and anxiety disorders in the future.",Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD,10368212,K23MH126193,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Randomized', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analog', 'base', 'career development', 'computerized', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness trial', 'feasibility testing', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kernel methods', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized predictions', 'programs', 'psychoeducation', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'skills', 'technology development', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment program', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,K23,2021,181480
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052
"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Label', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Science', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Update', 'Volition', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dietary', 'effective intervention', 'field study', 'good diet', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mimetics', 'neural network', 'obesity management', 'operation', 'overweight adults', 'robotic system', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303
"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI) Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI) Project Summary Data science is poised to impact scientific research, innovation, discovery and healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because of the rapid growth of infrastructure such as cell phones and computers, and the availability of technologies like Artificial Intelligence. These methods and resources present huge opportunities to leapfrog current research, public health and clinical care in Africa by utilizing data science to address the huge burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases in SSA. Despite these promises however, there are substantial concerns about the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of data science research in SSA. These concerns arise from the use of conventional and unconventional data; the methods for generating, manipulating, storing, sharing and utilizing data in data science; the limitations of current informed consent models in these scenarios and opportunities for novel strategies for legal oversight of the ELSI of data science research in Nigeria. In this collaborative project between the Center for Bioethics and Research (CBR), Nigeria, George Washington University, DC and University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), we will evaluate current legal instruments, guidelines and frameworks, and their implementation, and use these to develop new and innovative governance frameworks to support data science health research in Nigeria. We will also implement mixed research methods to prospectively evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of data scientists and ethics committees to current and emerging ELSI of data science research in Nigeria. Given the novelty of data science in Nigeria, we will implement general and specific, short and medium-term training in ethics of data science research in Nigeria for data science researchers and an introduction to data science for members of ethics committees reviewing data science research projects. Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI) Project Narrative  The Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Research (BridgELSI) Project is a collaborative research ethics study and training project that is focused on bridging the gaps in current governance framework on ethical oversight of data science health research by engaging key stakeholders to evaluate and co-develop novel governance framework for the Ethical Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of data science health research in Nigeria. The project will implement short and medium-term training on ethics of data science for data scientists, ethicists and ethics committees, and strengthen the ethical working environment for data science health research in Nigeria. The project brings together talented and highly productive researchers at the Center for Bioethics and Research (CBR), Nigeria, George Washington University, DC and University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).",Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI),10308577,U01MH127693,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Cellular Phone', 'Committee Members', 'Computers', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Ethics Committees', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lawyers', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nigeria', 'Nigerian', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'data framework', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'low and middle-income countries', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'participant safety', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid growth', 'responsible research conduct', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'training project']",NIMH,"CENTER FOR BIOETHICS AND RESEARCH, NIGERIA",U01,2021,400000
"Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) PROJECT SUMMARY The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project has the overall aims of producing new knowledge in regard to the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of conducting data science research, to develop evidence-based, context specific guidance for the conduct and governance of data science initiatives such as DS-I Africa, and to strengthen the culture of responsible data science in Southern Africa. The project will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 is research intensive and will obtain empirical data on key stakeholder views regarding the development of data science guidance to inform governance of DSI-Africa Research Hubs in Southern Africa. This phase will start with conceptual research and normative analysis of the ELSI issues related to data science. Important concepts to explore will include data sovereignty where data protection is balanced with responsible data sharing. Given that digital data is often experienced as intangible and abstract by the lay public, the project will employ crowdsourcing as a form of citizen science to inform the development of innovative educational tools that could be adapted for stakeholder engagement in data science in the DS-I Africa network. Using these tools, we will conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain their experiences with ELSI-data science related challenges, gaps in current guidance and their views on procedural and substantive aspects of guidance development in data science governance. Key themes that emerge from the empirical research will underpin our approach to co-creation of guidelines, procedures and policies required in the DS-I Africa consortium. During phase 1, ethics consultants embedded in the Research Hubs will address emerging ELSI concerns. In Phase 2 of this project, we will develop guidance documents informed by phase 1 research and by best practices in international data science research guidance, the limited experience and existing literature to date concerning data science research and governance of data management in Southern Africa. Importantly, such guidance will be informed by the values of solidarity, sharing and mutual benefit - important concepts in Southern African moral frameworks based on communal good. This approach is congruent with health data ecosystems that require different stakeholders to work collaboratively for health innovation. The results of these policy-related activities will be tempered with key concerns and principles identified in our conceptual and empirical work and will provide locally grounded, practical guidance on the ELSI of data science research conducted in the hubs. In Phase 3 of the project, we aim to amplify the impact and enhance the sustainability of our research and governance activities by creating ELSI networks and communication channels focusing on data science in Southern Africa. This will involve establishing an ELSI Data Science Southern African Network (EDSSAN) to respond to evolving ELSI concerns in DS-I Africa Research Hubs beyond the funding period, hosting annual conferences, and leveraging existing local networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE Southern Africa faces numerous public health challenges due to the high prevalence of communicable and non- communicable diseases. For this reason, innovative public health research, such as data science (or ‘big data’) approaches, are crucial to promote population health and reduce health inequality. The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project will explore the ethical, legal and social implications of the Harnessing Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa (DS-I Africa) initiative by conducting empirical, conceptual and normative research, and developing contextualized evidence-based guidance with the overall aim of enhancing the governance of data science research for health promotion in southern Africa.",Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA),10310553,U01MH127704,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Research', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Empirical Research', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Ethics Consultation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Penetration', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'South Africa', 'Southern Africa', 'Structure', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud storage', 'commune', 'community engagement', 'computerized data processing', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'data ecosystem', 'data exchange', 'data framework', 'data literacy', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'empowered', 'ethical legal social implication', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health inequalities', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'open data', 'population health', 'public health ethics', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'public trust', 'responsible research conduct', 'solidarity', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIMH,STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY TYGERBERG CAMPUS,U01,2021,400000
"Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise. There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES, the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise- specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real- world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage during exercise, and few validated tools exist to recommend treatment options to avoid dangerous complications resulting from low blood glucose. This proposal combines physiological modelling and deep learning to develop a novel artificial intelligence decision support system to help multiple daily injection users maintain safe blood glucose levels during and after exercise. We will build and validate this system in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes,10231944,F30DK128914,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Jogging', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'base', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'exercise regimen', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'human model', 'human study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'smartphone Application', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence-based guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management aimed at glycemic control (reduced hemoglobin A1c) include a combination of diet, physical activity (PA), glucose monitoring, and medication adherences. However, the majority of individuals with T2DM are unable to follow these guidelines due to a lack of consistent health behavior counseling offered in the primary care setting. This problem is amplified in remote rural communities within the U.S. In response, this project aims to create an optimized telehealth-based intervention – Gamified Optimized Diabetes management with Artificial Intelligence–powered Rural Telehealth (GODART). GODART is grounded in the social cognitive theory and will serve as an automated behavior-monitoring and telecoaching platform. At the core, GODART is an automated conversational style behavior-monitoring system using natural language–understanding technologies. In this project, we propose to pilot and feasibility test the various components of GODART by leveraging multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an efficient and rigorous resource-management and continuous- improvement framework for developing optimized interventions. Our proposal focuses on the MOST preparatory phase and will use a full factorial experimentation. We will pilot and assess the feasibility of and evaluate two different intervention components, with two levels in each of the groups, yielding four experimental conditions. These groups will test the effect of (i) a fixed vs. adaptive (gamified) rewards program and (ii) automated vs. human-delivered weekly health coaching. We will end the project with exit interviews conducted with a subset of participants. Study findings will help us learn the feasibility of delivering such an intervention and its preliminary effectiveness in reducing HbA1c, leading to adequately powered confirmatory effectiveness studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this study is to pilot and assess feasibility of implementing an artificial intelligence assisted individualized lifestyle modification intervention for glycemic control in rural populations, which can delivered even regular a landline phone service. This study will provide us knowledge to plan a well powered optimization trial in future to develop an optimal (low cost) intervention package that can be delivered in a sustainable manner to the rural portions of America.",Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART),10276845,R01DK129378,"['Address', 'American', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Congresses', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Deep South', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Educational Materials', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style Modification', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Rural Population', 'Services', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Urban Community', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes prevention program', 'effectiveness study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marginalized population', 'mathematical ability', 'medication compliance', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'patient oriented', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural counties', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'telehealth', 'telephone coaching', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,297000
"Long-term effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies and using machine learning based predictive analytics to tailor treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This Career Development Award will support Dr. Marvin Langston in his transition to independence as a translational researcher. His long-term research goals include understanding the etiology and outcomes of urologic conditions with an emphasis on prostate diseases (prostate cancer, prostatitis, and lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS)); developing and validating clinical tools to improve and personalize treatment options; and implementing these tools in “real world” clinical settings.  BPH/LUTS is an extremely common set of conditions among older men and can be considered a progressive disease, mainly characterized by deteriorating LUTS over time which causes considerable bother and decreased quality of life, urinary retention, and death in rare cases. Conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. Despite a high volume of pharmacological research, there have been very limited advances in therapy for BPH/LUTS in recent years. Therefore, innovative and well-designed studies are needed to understand the long-term comparative effectiveness of contemporary BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies while leveraging the clinical covariates that can be captured in “big data” sources such as the electronic health record.  To address these limitations, In Aim 1, Dr. Langston will evaluate the long-term comparative effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies in an observational study drawn from the Kaiser Permanente membership population, a fully integrated healthcare network. If well designed studies demonstrate that contemporary pharmacological approaches are not more effective at preventing long-term BPH/LUTS progression than conventional approaches alone, then personalized treatment options may ultimately provide the best strategy for reducing long-term BPH/LUTS progression. Therefore, in Aim 2 Dr. Langston will develop and validate predictive models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data available at the time of BPH/LUTS diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of long-term BPH/LUTS clinical outcomes (acute urinary retention and BPH surgery) using machine learning based predictive analytics.  As the volume, availability, and access to electronic data increases, so does the need for scientists with the content and methodologic expertise to correctly use and translate these data into improved urology care. This K01 provides the training for Dr. Langston to meet this challenge as a translational researcher and compete successfully for future R01 funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS) is an extremely common set of conditions among older men, yet conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of contemporary treatment strategies and use predictive modeling to determine which patients are likely to exhibit long-term BPH/LUTS progression. Given the considerable cost of BPH/LUTS management and impact on the general health and quality of life in older men, identification of effective and personalized pharmacological treatment strategies is critical.",Long-term effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies and using machine learning based predictive analytics to tailor treatment.,10283752,K01DK129405,"['5 Alpha-Reductase Inhibitor', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Anti-Cholinergics', 'Asian Americans', 'Benign', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Muscle Tonus', 'Muscle relaxation phase', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodule', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Progressive Disease', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Diseases', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urinary Retention', 'Urology', 'Validation', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'black men', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'member', 'men', 'novel', 'older men', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prostatitis', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'urologic']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K01,2021,160347
"iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY A decade ago, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended dietary pattern approaches to examine relationships between diet and health outcomes. Meanwhile, longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing dynamic diet-quality variations and remain rudimentary for validating longitudinal diet-quality patterns, thus, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between the dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field with explosive growth of artificial intelligence algorithms. We propose to develop “iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials”. iPAT will leverage original and newly harmonized dietary data generated from 7 studies funded by NIDDK, NHLBI, and NIMH: 4 longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCT) in Massachusetts (MA), and 3 large-scale longitudinal multi-site national studies, an RCT and one observational study (OS) from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and one OS from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We aim to harness over 20 newly-harmonized dietary datasets from these highly-comparable longitudinal studies that span up to 35 years and cross 50 clinical and health community centers to: 1) innovate by adapting our new visualization-aided trajectory pattern-recognition and validation algorithm to an intelligent and streamlined pattern analysis tool (iPAT) for longitudinal dietary data; 2) enable a new multi-view and comprehensive understanding of diet-quality trajectory patterns for multiple chronic disease outcomes that may not be discoverable from individual studies at different levels of granularity; and 3) create an accessible and expandable harmonized dietary database and open-access iPAT tool for diet-related studies. Our harmonized-data-driven approach will increase the likelihood of successfully addressing complex and subtle questions with large-scale dietary data, including but not limited to the cultural, age, gender and geographic variation in diet quality patterns and how diet quality may vary with context and time. Our iPAT approach will be built upon PI Fang’s behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition method which has been validated and replicated in five NIDA/NCI/NHLBI-funded longitudinal OS and RCTs. Developing this evidence- based iPAT tool will contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern-recognition methods, help scientific communities and the public to compare individual dietary behavior with local and national diet- quality patterns and associated dietary health risks. Our work will also help grow more valid evidence for dietary guidelines. More broadly, this iPAT project will contribute to creating a platform that supports harmonized data management, near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Understanding human food intake behavior and related health risks is critical for important societal goals such as preventing or managing many chronic conditions, promoting well-being and safety, and improving life-long health learning. Harnessing a number of harmonized dietary data from highly-comparable local and national trials, our innovative Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis (iPAT) tool will provide a more robust identification and visualization of diet-quality patterns and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of people over time and across geographic regions. Our work will help grow more valid evidence for formulating dietary guidelines and may enable better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies.",iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials,10276034,R01DK129432,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical learning', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R01,2021,748446
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,10083746,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2021,377124
"Molecular Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence Based Tools to Innovate Covalent and Noncovalent Drug Design Abstract Cancer and infectious diseases are threatening modern human kind. To combat the challenge, targeted cova- lent inhibition and targeted protein degradation are emerging as the new frontiers in drug discovery. This SBIR project seeks to meet two unmet needs in the emerging covalent as well as traditional reversible drug discovery programs by developing two commercial solutions based on cutting-edge research in molecular simulations and data science. In the Phase I period, ComputChem LLC has developed a local/cloud software application iTitrate that can offer accurate and reliable predictions of protein pKa values and nucleophilic cysteine and lysine. As the ﬁrst of its kind, iTitrate is based on a unique and extensively validated constant pH molecular dynamics approach and a very accurate and efﬁcient generalized Born implicit-solvent model. In Phase I, ComputChem also devel- oped a prototype of a novel small-molecule pKa prediction tool based on artiﬁcial intelligence. Building on the Phase I progress, the objective of the Phase II project is to signiﬁcantly accelerate, enhance, and demonstrate the capabilities of iTitrate and improve the accuracy of iKa. iTitrate can be applied to expedite efforts in a vari- ety of covalent drug discovery programs, including targeted covalent inhibitor design; kinome or proteome wide scanning for covalently targetable sites; protein-protein interaction inhibition; and proteolysis targeting chimera design. iTitrate can be further developed and integrated with iKa to offer a novel solution for accurate protonation state assignment and pH-dependent modeling of protein-ligand complexes, which would add signiﬁcant value to computer-aided lead optimization and other in silico drug design tasks.

"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,10217209,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,402815
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10256063,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,165542
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983
"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We will model cross-disciplinary collaboration by building upon an existing partnership between the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University and the Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, grounding the project in both computing and biomedical research practice.",Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25),10199482,R25GM141501,"['Academic Training', 'Attitude', 'Biomedical Research', 'Certification', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Home', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Peer Review', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer science', 'education pathway', 'education resources', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'literacy', 'novel', 'online course', 'outreach program', 'pedagogy', 'programs', 'science education', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'student training', 'success', 'user centered design']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R25,2021,85673
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767
"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35) PROJECT SUMMARY The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2) monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots, determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions. This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers. The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions, and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way.

"From atoms to mechanisms - Artificial Intelligence augmented molecular simulations for mechanistic ligand design While there have been numerous advances in computational methods aiding in rational drug design, most approaches so far take a static view of the drug target, ignoring the complexities associated with the dynamics and thermodynamics of conformational transitions. There is thus a pressing need for new computational methods that are accurate, tractable and automatable for large scale drug discovery and chemical biology studies that account for the changing nature of a generic drug target. Built on strong theoretical and computational preliminary results, this program seeks to understand and guide design of new inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and model riboswitches in a mechanistically guided paradigm. Our research program is driven by the central hypotheses that (a) mechanistically aware ligand design strategies can outperform traditional strategies guided only by structure, and (b) artificial intelligence (AI)- integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods can help learn mechanisms in a high-throughput fashion. Our program can be split into two overarching yet complementary thematic areas. In the first area, we will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics, MD simulations and AI to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change. Specifically we will build on our preliminary work in using ideas from neural information processing and natural language processing, and adapt them for advanced sampling methods that learn reaction coordinate, thermodynamics and kinetics on-the-fly as the simulation progresses. In addition, we will also be interacting closely with other leading computational groups to integrate our sampling methods with theirs and to facilitate efficient, accurate sampling for polarizable force-field development. In the second area, we will use our algorithms to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1 riboswitches. We will take a mechanistically driven perspective wherein we will map out the different conformations of a given target and understand how an existing ligand interacts with these, and then propose ligand modifications based upon this understanding. We will use our AI-augmented MD methods to understand the dissociation mechanisms of ligands in one uninterrupted “atoms to mechanism” workflow with minimal human intervention. All our predictions will be validated in different ways by our experimental collaborators at Stony Brook University and the National Cancer Institute This MIRA proposal will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change in drug targets. These algorithms will be used to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1 riboswitches.",From atoms to mechanisms - Artificial Intelligence augmented molecular simulations for mechanistic ligand design,10275014,R35GM142719,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Generic Drugs', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Work', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'conformational conversion', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'neural information processing', 'programs', 'simulation']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R35,2021,373755
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs in order to reduce patients' suffering and improve quality of life.",Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,10237990,K23HL143181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'American', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical center', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital services', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'physical symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'skills', 'study population', 'supportive environment', 'unstructured data', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173102
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,10219347,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2021,118570
"Informing the Emergency Care of Septic Shock Patients: A Novel Application of Data-Driven Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Septic shock is a commonly, costly, and deadly condition. There is increasing recognition that septic shock patients vary significantly in terms of (1) clinical presentation, (2) response to treatments, and (3) clinical outcomes. This patient-level heterogeneity may explain why optimal early septic shock management remains poorly understood. Patients with septic shock are four times more likely to die than septic patients without shock. Our preliminary data shows that Black patients have higher odds of mortality from septic shock compared to White patients. Current studies do not characterize patient heterogeneity among septic shock patients and do not explicate pharmacogenetic factors that may influence disparities in outcomes. Objective: Insights from synergistic data types are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of septic shock heterogeneity and hereditable factors that may influence vasopressor response and disparities in outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize both phenotypic and genetic aspects of heterogeneity in septic shock. This work is organized into two aims: (1) Identify Septic Shock Phenotypes Using Advanced Analytic Methods and (2) Quantify Vasopressor Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms by Race and Vasopressor Response. Our overall hypothesis is that advanced analytic methods applied to clinical and genetic data can identify defining features of septic shock heterogeneity that are relevant to early septic shock management in the Emergency Department and disparities in outcomes. Methods: (Aim 1) We will use a national dataset of septic patients with hypotension refractory to initial Emergency Department fluid resuscitation and apply unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to define clinically relevant phenotypes of early septic shock patients. We will analyze phenotypic variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Then, we will develop a supervised model for phenotype classification. (Aim 2) We will perform targeted pharmacogenomics of 100 samples balanced for race, 73 of which are part of an existing research biobank of septic shock patients from our urban, safety-net hospital. We will enroll an additional 27 patients to complete the sample. We will examine the presence of risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms for vasopressor-relevant genes by race. We will also examine the association between the targeted genetic polymorphisms and shock reversal. Career Development: During the proposed Career Development Award, I will work with my mentorship team to build the skills necessary to achieve independence as a clinical researcher. Specifically, I will 1) receive hands-on experience in the design and conduct of translational clinical research studies, 2) take didactic coursework in data science, biomedical informatics, and implementation science, 3) receive training and education in translational data science, clinical decision support, pharmacogenomics, and precision public health, and 4) become a leader and an effective mentor in academic emergency medicine. Project Narrative Septic shock is the most severe manifestation of sepsis and has a mortality rate above 40%. Unfortunately, existing sepsis research is limited by poorly understood variation and heterogeneity within septic shock patient populations. This study innovatively combines electronic health record and genetic data to improve the care of critically ill Emergency Department patients with septic shock, and addresses disparities in racial representation present in prior research.",Informing the Emergency Care of Septic Shock Patients: A Novel Application of Data-Driven Analytics,10347895,K23GM144802,"['ADRB2 gene', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypotension', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resuscitation', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic infection', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Undifferentiated', 'Variant', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'black patient', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'racial disparity', 'research study', 'response', 'risk variant', 'safety net', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'translational physician', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K23,2021,180244
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,10217235,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,172800
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Side Effects', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'provider adherence', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10247089,K01HL150318,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'California', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'feeding', 'genetic information', 'genomic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'multiple data sources', 'online course', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prognostic model', 'programs', 'random forest', 'structured data', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2021,175284
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,10440236,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'risk prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'trauma induced coagulopathy', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2021,51036
"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10464976,F32HL151181,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Inequality', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'claudication', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'provider adherence', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,85488
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,10223433,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,770274
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Predicting and Preventing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers an advanced treatment option for conditions that are otherwise incurable. Pulmonary complications are common following HSCT and severely compromise its overall success rate. The most severe end of this spectrum is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs in 5% of patients following HSCT, with a mortality >60%. As effective treatments for ARDS are lacking, developing new ways to prevent ARDS is likely to be more successful in improving patient outcomes. Two critical knowledge gaps make developing successful prevention strategies difficult: 1) an inability to reliably identify high-risk patients before ARDS has developed and; 2) an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and subtypes of post-HSCT ARDS. The scientific objectives of this application are to address these critical knowledge gaps through the following Specific Aims:  1) Develop and validate a risk-prediction model incorporating pre-transplant, post-transplant and in-  hospital risk factors that can help identify which patients are most likely to develop post-HSCT ARDS.  2) Prospectively evaluate metabolomics in patients at high-risk of developing post-HSCT ARDS and utilize  clinical, biomarker and metabolomics data to explore endophenotypes of post-HSCT ARDS. Aim 1 leverages highly innovative data extraction techniques to develop a real-time continuous ARDS risk surveillance system for patients who undergo HSCT. Aim 2 evaluates the role of metabolomics, an emerging analytic tool, in advancing mechanistic understanding of why patients develop post-HSCT ARDS, as well as whether recently described ARDS endophenotypes can be identified post-HSCT ARDS. The applicant’s long-term goals are to: 1) become an independent translational clinician-scientist leading a multidisciplinary research team focused on improving outcomes of patients who develop respiratory complications after HSCT, and 2) develop effective strategies to prevent post-HSCT ARDS, one of the most significant post-transplant complications today. The training goals of the applicant are to develop advanced skills in statistics, biomedical modeling, machine learning, and metabolomics to facilitate these long-term goals. To address these training needs, the applicant has constructed a comprehensive career development plan that includes targeted didactic opportunities in the areas of training need above, with additional “hands-on” experience in all of these areas. The mentorship team and research environment is uniquely well suited to the applicant’s needs, combining expertise in critical care informatics and metabolomics at a high-volume academic transplant center. The proposal supports the NIH mission by striving to improve outcomes of patients who develop respiratory failure after transplantation, while training a junior investigator in the essential skills necessary for his transition to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Respiratory complications after stem cell transplantation remain unacceptably common and are associated with substantial patient suffering, healthcare utilization, and mortality. In this proposal, we explore how best to predict which patients develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) – one of the most severe forms of respiratory failure – after transplant and use these clinical prediction tools to better study the mechanism of ARDS development through a novel analytic technique (metabolomics). We will then combine clinical and metabolomics data to help identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from targeted preventative interventions, the implementation of which will be the goal of future projects.",Predicting and Preventing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,10210479,K23HL151671,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'computer studies', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'post-transplant', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'translational physician', 'translational scientist', 'translational study', 'transplant centers']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2021,162756
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411
"Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the long-term career goal of becoming a leading independent researcher using technology-driven precision medicine approaches to improve obesity outcomes in primary care, the candidate, Dr. Hallie Espel- Huynh, PhD, proposes a mentored research project and career development plan that will prepare her to use advanced analytics to personalize routine clinical care for patients with obesity. Despite the promise of online interventions to maximize access to effective behavioral obesity treatments in primary care, many patients do not benefit due to nonresponse. Evidence-based rescue interventions (EBRI) can improve outcomes for these patients, however, primary care clinicians require guidance on when and how to intervene, and such a tool does not yet exist. Clinical decision support (CDS) has the potential to fill this gap by predicting risk for nonresponse, delivering alerts about this risk to clinicians, and enabling interventions to reverse it. The overall objective of this training application is to develop such a CDS for use in primary care and test its usability with primary care clinicians. The proposal aims to (1) use stakeholder input to align the content and format of the CDS with primary care providers’ needs, (2) build a machine learning model to predict early risk for online obesity treatment nonresponse for integration into the CDS, and (3) design the prototype CDS and test its usability with primary care clinicians, focusing on outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness for the target primary care setting. This project is the first to combine precise nonresponse risk prediction with stakeholder-informed CDS to produce a tool that has the potential to maximize obesity treatment outcomes in primary care via delivery of CDS-facilitated, clinician-delivered rescue interventions. This research will result in a complete CDS tool that is ready for future clinical testing with patients in primary care, and which could greatly enhance the potential impact of online obesity treatment in this setting. The research plan is complemented by career development activities that include formal training in technology-assisted obesity and CVD management in primary care, stakeholder-centered CDS development, machine learning, and mixed methods for patient-oriented implementation research. Under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, execution of the proposed research and training plan will lead Dr. Espel-Huynh to submission of a competitive R01 grant application to test CDS effectiveness in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Behavioral treatment for obesity is being disseminated online to at-risk patients in primary care, yet high levels of nonresponse limit its potential public health impact. The proposed research aims to use stakeholder input to develop a clinical decision support tool that guides clinicians to efficiently and effectively intervene on obesity treatment nonresponse, which will ultimately improve obesity treatment outcomes and reduce weight-related cardiovascular disease risk.",Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support,10301403,K23HL155733,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical effect', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'frontier', 'i(19)', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obese patients', 'obesity treatment', 'online intervention', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'usability']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K23,2021,187418
"Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians Project Summary The Emergency Department (ED) is a central pillar of the health care system. ED physicians and nurses are exposed to high work-related stressors in addition to disruptive day-night shifts. The well- being of the 150,000 ED clinicians in the U.S. is important for public health with significant downstream effects on the well-being of the 145 million patients that are served every year. Of the 1 million U.S. physicians, 45% are reporting burnout symptoms and the number increases to 70% in ED physicians and up to 82% in ED nurses. Clinician burnout is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, mortality, medical errors, but also stress-mediated physiological alterations and cognitive decline. Yet, the knowledge about the long-term development of burnout is limited. To effectively intervene, the timely identification of ED clinicians at risk for burnout is a critical prerequisite. This study proposes an innovative approach using digital phenotyping to discover and test Digital Biomarkers as predictors of burnout symptoms and cognitive function.  This proposed prospective longitudinal study will chart cognitive functioning and burnout symptom trajectories in a cohort of 350 ED clinicians to inform when, where, and how to intervene. We will use advanced computational methods to extract objective markers for burnout and cognitive decline from video and audio data. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that voice and speech content, head movement, pupil dilation, gaze, and facial landmark features of emotion provide probabilistic information that will allow us to identify digital biomarkers for burnout and cognitive function.  We will test the relevance of the discovered digital biomarkers and determine their discriminatory accuracy to distinguish between risk for clinically relevant vs. non-relevant burnout symptoms. We examine the association of digital biomarkers with physiological markers of chronic stress (i.e., hair cortisol concentration). We will also assess the association of digital biomarkers with the long-term job-related stress load of individual ED clinicians such as high ED crowding, patient acuity level, ED staffing, sleep, and shift schedules. This research program aims to deliver an objective, accurate, and reliable digital measure for clinician well-being. Such digital biomarkers will enable more efficient ED clinician self-management and will promote low-threshold prevention strategies. The mental and physical well-being of ED clinicians is of high value to those who work day in and day out to save the lives of others and is the foundation of a well-functioning, high-quality emergency care system. Project Narrative Clinician burnout has reached endemic levels and is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but knowledge gaps in assessing and understanding the longitudinal development of burnout hamper risk-based prevention and targeted interventions. We propose a novel digital phenotyping approach using deep learning based on a video-recorded interview about the experiences of emergency clinicans at work with the aim to identify objective digital biomarkers that predict burnout and cognitive functioning in emergency clinicians. We will determine how candidate digital biomarkers relate to physiological markers of chronic stress, and test the potential of digital biomarkers to self-manage burnout risk and promotes low-threshold burnout prevention.",Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians,10298751,R01HL156134,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department crowding', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mydriasis', 'Nurses', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prognosis', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'burnout', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular effects', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'safety net', 'screening', 'shift work', 'social', 'stressor']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,735788
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375

"Human-AI Collaborations to Improve Accuracy and Mitigate Bias in Acute Dyspnea Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY Acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and hospitalizations each year. Heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common etiologies, representing 2.5 million hospitalizations in the US in 2017. Determining the precise cause of acute dyspnea is critically important but challenging, as presenting symptoms, laboratory testing, and imaging results may be difficult to interpret, particularly in the elderly and patients with comorbid disease or severe illness. Diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment may occur in up to 30% of patients, which is associated with worse patient outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been proposed to augment providers in the diagnostic process and are well-positioned to support the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. However, inaccurate AI tools can also worsen clinician performance. Therefore, simply keeping clinicians “in-the-loop” is not a guaranteed back-stop against a poorly performing model. This proposal seeks to enable effective Clinician-AI collaborations to improve diagnostic accuracy in acute dyspnea. We propose to: 1) evaluate computational strategies to improve the robustness of an AI tool used to support clinicians in the diagnosis of acute dyspnea, 2) test strategies to enhance collaborations between clinicians and AI tools, 3) prospectively evaluate an acute dyspnea AI tool in a clinical environment while evaluating strategies to collect clinician feedback to enable ongoing model improvement. Our multidisciplinary team consisting of experts in clinical medicine, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction are well positioned to tackle these important challenges. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a robust, generalizable acute dyspnea AI tool to augment physicians in the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. More broadly, the proposal will lead to generalizable knowledge to support safer development and integration of AI tools across healthcare settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate diagnosis is critical for patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath), since depending on the cause (e.g., pneumonia versus congestive heart failure) treatment may vary. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can be trained to analyze clinical and imaging data to determine the diagnosis but are susceptible to bias that results in poor generalization performance. Creating an environment where clinicians collaborate with AI to solve clinical challenges may realize the promise of AI in improving patient care.",Human-AI Collaborations to Improve Accuracy and Mitigate Bias in Acute Dyspnea Diagnosis,10272748,R01HL158626,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multitask', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'sex', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,705334
"Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden Project Summary Globally, Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death and a particular concern in countries with a high HIV burden. With only 57% of cases being successfully treated, multi-drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB) has become a substantial barrier to TB control. High rates of loss to follow up (LTFU) (i.e., missing two or more consecutive months of treatment) are a major contributor to the low MDR-TB treatment success rates. LTFU may lead to additional antibiotic resistance, MDR-TB treatment failure, and death. The World Health Organization recommends that patients at-risk for LTFU be given priority attention, but there is currently no evidence-based way to identify these patients. In order to address this gap, the proposed study will develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment based on characteristics present at treatment initiation. If accurate, this model will identify the patients who are at high-risk for LTFU and who will draw the greatest benefit from interventions that promote care engagement and retention. Although the reasons for LTFU are complex, past research has yielded a number of potential predictors that will inform the proposed prediction model, including male sex, age, housing instability, alcohol use, substance use, employment status, education level, rural residence, and prior episode(s) of TB. In addition to factors present at treatment initiation, the relationship between LTFU and factors that change throughout treatment, including adverse treatment events and treatment regimen, will be examined to develop a broader understanding of MDR-TB care engagement. The proposed study will be nested within the control arm of a cluster-randomized trial of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (R01 AI104488). The specific aims of the proposed study, titled “Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from MDR-TB Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden”, are to conduct a nested, retrospective cohort study among patients who were LTFU or successfully completed MDR-TB treatment (i.e., cured or completed treatment) to: (1a) develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB care based on the patient characteristics available at treatment initiation utilizing LASSO regression and k-fold cross-validation; (1b) adapt the prediction model developed in Aim 1a into a tool that can be used by providers at the point of care to estimate a patient’s risk for LTFU; (1c) determine if type of treatment regimen is a risk factor for LTFU and if it improves the fit of the prediction model developed in Aim 1a; and (2) examine the relationship between LTFU and the timing and burden of adverse treatment effects. This study will be the first to take a predictive modeling approach to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying patients at high-risk for LTFU and prioritizing their receipt of support services in order to ultimately improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings. Through the proposed study and training plan, the applicant will gain experience analyzing large, complex longitudinal data and applying machine learning to optimize patient engagement and clinical care. Narrative The World Health Organization estimates that 16% of all multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients are lost to follow up (LTFU), placing them at increased risk for treatment failure, death, and the development of additional resistance to antituberculosis medications. Despite mounting knowledge about the risk factors for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment and the End TB Strategy directive that patients at-risk for suboptimal treatment success be given priority attention, there is currently no evidence-based method that allows for the early identification of patients at-risk for being lost from care. The proposed study will use a nested retrospective cohort design to develop a model for predicting LTFU from MDR-TB treatment that can ultimately be used to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying patients at high-risk for LTFU and prioritizing their receipt of support services that promote care engagement and retention.",Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden,10326602,F30AI165167,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Early identification', 'Educational Background', 'Employment Status', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Rifampin', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'co-infection', 'cost', 'data cleaning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'housing instability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'isoniazid', 'low and middle-income countries', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient engagement', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rural residence', 'sex', 'substance use', 'success', 'therapy adverse effect', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment risk', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care testing', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"The Atlantic Health Cancer Consortium Community Oncology Research Program (AHCC CORP) Project Summary Atlantic Health Cancer Consortium Community Oncology Research Program (AHCC-CORP) is the first NCORP Community Site within the state of New Jersey and combines the collective strengths of world-class healthcare systems with community oncology care delivery. AHCC-CORP covers a geographically and demographically diverse area representing 73% of New Jersey’s population. AHCC-CORP expands the NCORP network by 6.5M people; with a higher cancer incidence rate than the US as a whole (477.5 vs 441.2 cases per 100,000). Regions of AHCC-CORP are even further elevated. Specific Aims include: ​1) Increase adult and pediatric accruals to NCI cancer prevention, control, screening, and care delivery research studies, as well as treatment and imaging studies conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and biospecimen collection​. ​This will be accomplished by creating a unique and unprecedented cancer care consortium in New Jersey​. ​The Consortium has experienced cancer investigators in adult and pediatric cancers across multiple sites, including three children's hospitals. Separately, Consortium sites annually accrue an average of 130 ​participants to NCORP Research Bases, but with the leadership and infrastructure support of AHCC-CORP, affiliates are now poised to even further increase accruals. ​2) Enhance community engagement in ​cancer control and prevention clinical trials and Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) conducted by NCORP ​in the AHCC-CORP ​catchment area.

"Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.

"An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies An informatics bridge over the valley of death for Phase I trials of drug-combination cancer therapies Summary Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and pharmacokinetics, and most (58%) drugs intended as cancer therapies fail these initial trials. Thus, Phase I studies represent the largest valley of death in the course of drug development. Unlike the design of a single-drug Phase I study, the design of a drug-combination study requires prior knowledge of whether either drug changes the other’s drug exposure, the drugs share toxicities, and each drug has an established maximum tolerable dose. Although abundant toxicity and PK data are available in public domain sources, the data are not integrated, and no single database integrates data regarding both toxicity and PK. In addition, data regarding single-drug and drug-combination MTD and DLT are present in the literature but absent from any database. We are confident that a bridge can be built across the Phase I valley of death for cancer multi-drug research and development utilizing an informatics and pharmacometrics approach to take advantage of the abundant toxicity and PK data available for single drugs. In this grant, we propose a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) that integrates toxicity and PK data. Aim 1 will develop novel active-learning approaches to mine evidence of toxicity and PK regarding drug interactions from the literature. The active learning methodology will employ several innovations, including random negative sampling, stratified active learning by prescreening based on PubMed query, and deep learning with embedding. The final active-learning method is optimized by a thorough integration of these innovative components. Aim 2 will develop a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) for cancer research. The TDCKB will integrate toxicity and PK evidence for single drugs and drug combinations from various data sources. The evidence of DDI will be classified as either toxicity or PK, and the strength of the evidence will be annotated. Synthesized evidences, such as overlapping toxicity and predicted drug interactions between two drugs, will assist in Phase I drug combination trial design. Quality control will be conducted carefully during both data curation and TDCKB software development. Engagement of TDCKB users and the ITCR community is planned. Narrative Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and drug exposure, which have the largest failure rate, 58%, of cancer drug development, i.e. valley of death. Because of complexity of cancer biology, they usually require multi-drug therapies. In order to overcome the valley of death for multi-drug cancer therapies, we propose an informatics bridge, i.e. a translational drug interaction knowledge base (TDCKB), that will integrate multi-drug exposure and toxicity data from various data sources. TDCKB will accelerate the translational cancer drug combination development research to the next phase of clinical trials.",An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies,10305083,U01CA248240,"['Active Learning', 'Adverse event', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Awareness', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug toxicity', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Oncologist', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase Ib Trial', 'Preparation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Toxic effect', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'combination cancer therapy', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug development', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'pharmacometrics', 'phase 1 study', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'research and development', 'software development', 'symposium', 'translational engagement', 'translational impact', 'trial design']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,387617
"Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal. Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC); computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations. Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3 prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models. Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy. The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Combining immunotherapies with other cancer drugs has emerged as a new hope for late-stage cancer patients, however, the lack of a principled approach to identify such effective combinations often led to poorly designed clinical trials. The proposed research engages state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques with drug-induced transcriptomic changes to identify drugs that synergize with immunotherapies and prioritize them for clinical trials. Its application, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will rationalize clinical trials, identify new treatments for advanced cancers, and advance precision immuno-oncology.",Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy,10266758,K99CA248953,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAF gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Commons', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infiltration', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Drugs', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prize', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data access', 'deep learning', 'design', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'palliative chemotherapy', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prototype', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'statistics', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,120038
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy,10364532,R01CA249127,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Breast', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Numbness', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Platinum', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Vinca Alkaloids', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care systems', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy induced neuropathy', 'clinical decision-making', 'community based practice', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fall risk', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical ability', 'medication safety', 'neurotoxicity', 'older patient', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction', 'side effect', 'survivorship', 'taxane', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,689634
"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (from R01CA251566) This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are over diagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (from R01CA251566) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients' quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs.

"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The risk for gastric cancer in the general population of the United States is low; however, certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups are at much higher risk.

"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10271266,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'disease disparity', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high body mass index', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'obese person', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360281
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning progression', 'model development', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'product development', 'prototype', 'response', 'routine practice', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"Sustaining the Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and other computationally intensive methods have the potential to revolutionize cancer imaging research and patient care. The broad adoption of these technologies depends on the availability development of imaging informatics tools to assist users in managing massive data sets, generating well-curated annotations, and accessing scalable computing resources. The Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center has played a lead role in implementing cancer imaging informatics technology, with a focus on expanding the widely used open source XNAT informatics platform to better support computational workflows in cancer imaging. I3CR has also developed knowledge management tools to better track data processing and analysis, including tools for orchestrating and tracking container-based computing pipelines. As result of this work, XNAT has emerged as the most widely used imaging informatics platform in cancer research. It is deployed in over 200 organizations across academia and industry and has been adopted across a wide range of research contexts, including preclinical imaging, multi-site clinical trials, and clinical translation. As the I3CR informatics platform has matured and been widely adopted, the Center is now evolving to the next phase of development to more broadly sustain the platform. In the work proposed here, we will sustain the I3CR’s ongoing engineering initiatives and expand its outreach efforts. The Center’s sustainment activities will build on and extend the I3CR platform’s expansive set of data and knowledge management capabilities, with a focus on addressing key emergent needs within our user base. In Aim 1, we will continue to develop the XNAT-based data management platform, including adding standards-based clinical interfaces, developing a cohort discovery service with natural language processing support, implementing a task automation service, and extending its container-based computing service to support high performance computing and cloud computing environments. In Aim 2, we will implement a suite of integrations with complementary image analysis and data sharing platforms, including The Cancer Image Archive and the NCI Imaging Data Commons.

"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Latinx', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positive Reinforcements', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective intervention', 'efficacious intervention', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'obesity risk', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893

"Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images The objective of the proposed project is to develop a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prediction model to identify individuals who have high risk for PDAC in the next 3 years through Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images and non-imaging factors. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer- related deaths in both men and women in the United States despite its low incidence rate. The 5-year survival rate for all stages of PDAC is 10% but can be as high as 50% with early-stage diagnosis. Therefore, identification of individuals at high risk for PDAC has high clinical significance as follow-up imaging examinations or biopsy may assist in early detection and allow surgical intervention while the tumors are still resectable. However, PDAC prediction is difficult due to the lack of reliable screening tools, the absence of sensitive and specific symptoms and biomarkers, and low prevalence.  Abdominal pain is the single most common reason that Americans visit the emergency room (ER), where an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan is usually performed. Even though most scans don’t show any signs of cancer visible to the naked eyes of radiologists, some subjects eventually develop PDAC in the next few years. These pre-diagnostic CT images provide critical morphological information associated with biological changes at the pre-cancer or early cancer stage, which can be extracted using AI to predict PDAC risk. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to uncover unique features in pre-diagnostic images using AI and develop PDAC prediction model based on these features. Non-imaging factors such as demographic, epidemiologic, and anthropometric factors, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory tests will be included in the model to improve the prediction accuracy. The primary hypotheses are a) AI allows extraction of unique image features in pre-diagnostic CT images associated with pre-cancer or early cancer biological changes that are invisible to naked eyes and b) the combination of pre-diagnostic image features and non- imaging factors improves the accuracy of PDAC risk stratification and prediction over that using conventional non-imaging factors alone. To verify these hypotheses, we will retrospectively evaluate CT pancreatic images obtained up to 3 years prior to PDAC diagnosis that were deemed non-cancerous by radiologists. A group of subjects who underwent similar imaging studies for non-gastrointestinal disorders and were age/gender matched with pre-diagnostic imaging will serve as healthy controls. Accurately stratifying high risk individuals may allow for early detection of PDAC in the future. A major challenge of the project is the scarcity of the appropriate imaging data because of the low prevalence of PDAC and stringent enrollment criteria. Eight major medical centers will participate in collection of 1,064 cases. The end point of this project is the development, training, and validation of an AI-based PDAC prediction model, which will identify individuals who are at high risk for developing PDAC within the next 3 years. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a common type of pancreatic cancer, is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm based on computed- tomography scans to identify individuals at high risk for PDAC, which may allow early detection and increase survival rate.",Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images,10236146,R01CA260955,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accounting', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic duct', 'Patients', 'Reader', 'Resectable', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Tail of pancreas', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human error', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'large datasets', 'men', 'mortality', 'pancreas imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'tumor']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1160586
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Advance Care Planning', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Jail', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction', 'routine care']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174
"Adapting a machine learning algorithm to predict thyroid cytopathologyin LMIC Abstract Pathology expertise and services in low and middle income countries (LMIC) are severely inadequate and limited. One area in which pathology is especially critical for diagnosis and clinical decision making is thyroid related disease and cancers. The incidences of thyroid nodules and cancers have increased worldwide. A fundamental part of the clinical assessment for thyroid nodules is ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Unfortunately, this cytopathology expertise is scarce in LMIC and many nodules are surgically removed for diagnosis. Since 90-95% of these nodules are without malignancy, many patients undergo unnecessary surgery with the associated risks, financial costs, and stressing already limited resources. What is critically needed is a means to provide cytopathology expertise to interpret thyroid FNAB in LMIC. The overall goal of this proposal is to implement our ML approach into low resource settings to provide accurate and timely cytopathology analysis of FNAB specimens. This R21/33 proposal focuses on MLA adaptation using smartphones for LMIC (R21) and subsequent capacity building and implementation (R33) through well-established LMIC research partnerships in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam. We hypothesize that our MLA can use smartphone captured images to assess probability of malignancy in thyroid FNAB that is comparable to trained cytopathologists. Our Aims are: R21: Adaptation of a smartphone approach to capture cytopathology images for MLA analysis. Archived FNAB samples used at different international institutions will be used to train and adapt the MLA with these images. Furthermore, we would train local personnel in LMIC to image capture using this new setup. The results from this phase will be an adapted MLA using smartphone images that has comparable sensitivity and specificity to the original MLA. R33: Implementation of the smartphone MLA approach into LMIC clinical settings. A prospective implementation of this approach in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam will be conducted. FNAB samples obtained would undergo standard of care pathology assessment as well as be analyzed with the MLA protocol. Local cytopathologist assessment will be compared with the MLA analysis. Outcome measures include MLA assessment of slides, technical slide review and image capture, concordance with pathology between MLA and expertise both in US and LMIC. The expected outcome will lead to a cost-effective method to implement MLA for thyroid FNAB that can be used in LMIC. This approach will not only assist in early diagnosis of thyroid cancers but also improve the utilization of limited resources through effectively identifying those that need surgery from those that do not. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cytopathology plays a critical role in the assessment of fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules that may harbor cancers. This expertise is a scarce resource in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). This project will tailor an existing machine learning algorithm for use in LMIC, specifically Tanzania and Vietnam, in order to have a future protocol in which expert cytopathology can be immediately accessible using existing equipment and mobile devices. This will be done through implementation of a protocol to analyze FNAB using a machine learning algorithm.",Adapting a machine learning algorithm to predict thyroid cytopathologyin LMIC,10269391,R21CA268428,"['Archives', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Country', 'Cytopathology', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Equipment', 'Financial cost', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'International', 'Iodine', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Nodule', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Vietnam', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,1000
"A clinical prediction rule for identifying South African colorectal cancer patients who will fail to engage in oncology care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health problem in South Africa (SA). Preliminary research from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), SA shows that 23% of newly diagnosed CRC patients in the public healthcare sector will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC). This complicates oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this setting. There are a variety of resource-intensive interventions for addressing FEOC. However, implementing these in all newly diagnosed CRC patients would be unfeasible, given the high patient volumes and existing resource constraints in the SA public healthcare sector. A clinical prediction rule (CPR) is proposed for identifying newly diagnosed SA CRC patients who are at high risk of FEOC, thereby enabling more efficient targeting of these specific, high risk patients for interventions which seek to address FEOC. The CPR will be developed by: 1) Identifying potential predictors of FEOC in CRC populations through a systematic review of the literature and a survey of 109 patients; 2) Constructing an appropriate electronic data collection tool that will streamline prospective data collection for these potential predictors and the study outcome, FEOC, from a cohort of 398 newly diagnosed CRC patients; and 3) Applying machine learning methods to the data to derive and internally validate the CPR. The CPR will be an important first step in tackling the high FEOC rates amongst newly diagnosed CRC patients in KZN, SA and will ultimately contribute toward improving both CRC disease management and patient outcomes in this setting. The proposed K43 research has the potential to be scaled up to the national level, and this will be the basis of a future R01 grant application. Dr. Moodley (K43 applicant) wants to become an independent gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs, particularly CPRs that seek to address breakdowns in linkage to care and reduce the burden of disease attributed to gastrointestinal cancers, such as CRC. This award will provide him with protected time to conduct the proposed research and engage in an intensive career development program while based at one of the top universities in SA, the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He will be mentored by esteemed senior researchers from SA (Prof. Thandinkosi Madiba, University of KwaZulu-Natal) and the US (Prof. Ravi Pokala Kiran, Columbia University) who have a strong track record of mentoring young researchers. A research advisory committee, comprised of other senior researchers, will provide additional research and career guidance to Dr. Moodley. This will be coupled with didactic and “hands on” training in the core competencies required to develop CPRs. It is envisioned that by the end of his K43 training, Dr. Moodley will have developed the proposed CPR and generated new preliminary data. He will use this new data to successfully apply for an R01 grant, thus establishing his independence as gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE An unacceptably high proportion of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA) will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC), thereby complicating oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this resource-limited setting. A novel clinical prediction rule (CPR) will be developed that will allow for specific CRC patients who are at higher risk of FEOC to be identified and efficiently targeted for resource-intensive strategies which seek to reduce FEOC rates. The CPR will be an important first step in tackling the high FEOC rates amongst newly diagnosed CRC patients in KZN, SA and will ultimately contribute toward improving both CRC disease management and patient outcomes in this setting.",A clinical prediction rule for identifying South African colorectal cancer patients who will fail to engage in oncology care,10295819,K43CA268978,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Books', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Health Care Sector', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surgical Oncologist', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vocational Guidance', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care systems', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic registry', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL,K43,2021,1000
"LABNET - RAPIDLY DEPLOYABLE AUTONOMOUS LABORATORY Laboratory automation is a key innovation that can help overcome the social distancing requirements due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Although, automation instruments have been used for decades in high throughput settings, they have not transitioned to routine laboratory research. Moreover, current laboratory automation lacks machine learning and artificial intelligence that can help guide design of experiments based on real-time analytics. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and commercialize a scalable software and hardware system, LABNET, which will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) tools, autonomous and modular laboratory instruments for data transmission and storage, and cloud computing for multi-scale and machine-learning (MS-ML) modeling and analytics for laboratory research. Phase I will focus on design and demonstration of the system to perform automated ELISA assays which will be guided by AI suite of tools for rapid screening of antibodies using a commercial off-the-shelf liquid handling system. Phase II will focus on integration of additional instrumentation, biological assays and high throughput instrumentation.

"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10347137,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2021,3000000
"SBIR TOPIC 417 Multiple Brain Metastases Stereotactic Radiosurgery Management Platform - Detection, Planning and Follow-up It was estimated that ~170,000 patients diagnosed with Brain metastases (BMs) in United States each year and most patients have clinical manifestation of multiple BMs (mBMs).  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used frequently for treating mBMs and demonstrated much less toxicity than conventional whole brain radiotherapy. Current SRS platform was designed for single-fraction treatment on limited number of targets, thus clinical workflow of mBMs SRS using extant platform is cumbersome: 1) labor-intensive manual mBMs identification and segmentation; 2) cumbersome manual planning mBMs into different treatment sessions; and 3) tedious tracking mBMs changes in treatment follow-up. Our team have been actively developing (R01-supported) an Artificial intelligence (AI)-based mBMs management platform, namely AimBMs, to optimize SRS mBMs patient care. This SBIR proposal targets to translate, validate and commercialize the AimBMs platform. The proposal consists of three aims: 1) develop a private cloud to integrate AimBMs platform into clinical practice environment; 2) refine and optimize AimBMs platform performance for site-specific practice using on-site incremental learning; and 3) validate AimBMs platform performance in 5 collaborating institutes. The success of this project will lead to bringing the AimBMs platform from a single academic institution use to a broad SRS community practice, benefitting a large mBMs population. n/a","SBIR TOPIC 417 Multiple Brain Metastases Stereotactic Radiosurgery Management Platform - Detection, Planning and Follow-up",10496726,5N91021C00031,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Community Practice', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'detection platform', 'follow-up', 'performance site', 'success']",NCI,NEURALRAD LLC,N43,2021,399559
"TOPIC 425: CHARACTERIZING HUMAN ACTIVITIES FOR CANCER HEALTH AWARENESS (CHA-CHA) SIFT and Wake Forest School of Medicine propose Characterizing Human Activities for Cancer Health Awareness (CHA-CHA) to recognize activities specifically selected by clinical Oncologists using Artificial Intelligence approaches that translate the patient's video data into symbolic information that humans can interpret. This enables physicians to receive reports on which activities are recognized, why they are recognized, and how the patient performed them. More importantly, this is all possible regardless of the physical distance between the physician and their cancer patient. CHA-CHA provides: accurate and interpretable patient activity, behavior, and performance recognition, automatically segmented activities in video, an iterative development process between SIFT and Wake Forest ensuring activities and performance parameters are directly relevant to the cancer health domain, inherent security through encrypted communication and abstraction of patient information, and experimental validation of accuracy compared to a gold standard. We use state of the art AI that reasons on symbolic information that, as opposed to black box algorithms, enables the physician to directly provide insights to refine recognition. CHA-CHA allows patients to live their lives at home and unburdened while physicians gain access to activity and performance records key to monitoring their health state between visits.

"Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools  The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) 2019 symposium hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) identified “a critical need to collect, analyze, and share data to address the burden of cancer in children, adolescents and young adults”. Currently, cancer registries in the U.S. hold structured information on every cancer case, including pediatric cancers, within their respective catchment areas. For childhood cancer patients and survivors, issues of late effects, recurrence, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), and follow-up are critically important to consider and further study. It is also important to address survivors’ life trajectories, which often include moving to different states and away from where their data was initially collected.   The aim of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is to build a connected data infrastructure that includes longitudinal data from multiple sources and enables secure sharing of childhood cancer data with vetted research investigators. These efforts will support childhood cancer research and provide a population-level dataset on all childhood cancer patients. As a base for the infrastructure, data currently collected at targeted cancer registries, including those in the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) program, will be used to aggregate key information on childhood cancer patients and survivors. In addition to registry data, NCCR aims to incorporate unique data sources including the National Death Index (NDI), State vital records, LexisNexis (residential history and social determinants of health data), and Virtual Pooled Registry (VPR) data on subsequent primaries, as well as pharmacy and radiation oncology data. Additional categories of information that may be integrated into the database include detailed diagnostic characterization of the tumor, treatment information, indicators of tumor recurrence, identification of multiple primary cancers, and genomic characterization of initial and potentially recurrent disease.   The Department of Energy (DOE)/Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest multipurpose science laboratory in the DOE national laboratory system. The mission of ORNL is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions to meet pressing global challenges aligned with the DOE’s goals. This “science-to-solutions” mission depends on the integration and application of distinctive capabilities in basic and applied research, which include leadership positions and capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC), advanced visualization and data fusion, and computational science and systems engineering and integration. ORNL is recognized as a leader in the research and development of health and data sciences. In the DOE national laboratory system, ORNL has a highly capable and proven data and computing enclave certified to host and analyze protected health information (PHI). ORNL’s capabilities, certified systems that accommodate PHI, HPC capabilities and facilities, and the technical expertise that has proven successful in a recent multi-year project with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) and its broader engagement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are unmatched in the domestic private sector, making ORNL uniquely qualified to perform the work required for this effort.    With growing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the national cancer surveillance program faces increasing challenges in capturing essential information needed to better understand the effectiveness of cancer treatments in the context of our complex medical and social environment. The capacity to collect automatically and comprehensively information about cancer patients would enhance the ability of cancer registry data to support a broad variety of cancer research and would provide an infrastructure that would permit evaluation of the generalizability of cancer diagnostics and therapies outside the clinical trials setting to the 97%  of the general population not covered by clinical trials. These advances will be important in future healthcare applications beyond cancer, and the knowledge gained will be directly related to technology for future HPC architectures and for making HPC more available to biomedical research.  The Current DOE collaboration with NIH/NCI, known as the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer, has produced several useful tools and documentation which have been utilized by the cancer surveillance community for adult cancer populations. In particular, ORNL has developed deep learning models and modalities of data analytics that are of particular interest to the NCCR. Their expertise and development of various tools using information from multiple data sources can be used to support various data queries, provide assessment of feasibility of developing trials, and enabling comparisons of key characteristics among the entire population of childhood cancer patients at a population level to compare to patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. Children’s Oncology Group [COG]). Furthermore, their expertise and computing capabilities will enable NCI to refine and develop scaling mechanisms of existing data extraction algorithms to obtain data from text documentation in pediatric cancer abstracts that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.    This infrastructure will serve as the central data index and warehouse for childhood cancer data through large-scale data identification and linkages and has the potential to provide real-world evidence to support data-driven clinical guidelines. These developed tools combined with this data infrastructure will also support a broad range of research questions. Through the shared follow-up information across registries and other data linkage sources, annual follow-up data will be greatly enhanced for childhood cancer survivors and pediatric oncology research.  The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding to 1) support the development and refinement of advanced computational tools (e.g., artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, graph analytics, text extraction algorithms, predictive modeling, and other advanced computational methodologies) using key data from the NCCR infrastructure and various other external data sources, and 2) utilize NCCR to further refine existing tools developed by DOE/ORNL. n/a",Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools ,10452467,PC20005001,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Catchment Area', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Late Effects', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Private Sector', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SEER Program', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'computerized tools', 'data fusion', 'data infrastructure', 'data registry', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'large scale data', 'multiple data sources', 'neoplasm registry', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'social health determinants', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,Y01,2021,1520000

"STSS - RARE DISEASES INFORMATICS PROGRAM (RDIP) SUPPORT Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983, Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration.  Informatics plays an important role in rare disease research support and patient care. Given the large number of different rare diseases, each of which affects only a small number of patients, assessing the broad rare diseases research and healthcare landscape is challenging. In order to better understand the ongoing research, treatment and healthcare utilization, and diagnostic journey of patients with rare diseases, NCATS ORDR is seeking to create a rare disease-specific analytics platform that could enable more efficient and coordinated approaches to data collection, integration and analysis from diverse sources, such as the medical literature, NIH databases and healthcare systems data. This could include establishing an informatics platform infrastructure, development of machine-learning tools and methods to identify, collect, integrate and analyze such data, and dissemination of the findings to the rare diseases research and clinical communities to help identify and inform rare diseases research priorities. Initially, building an informatics infrastructure framework and performing smaller pilot projects would be prioritized, with the larger goal of building on this experience to gain greater understanding of rare diseases research and healthcare over a broader scope over time. n/a",STSS - RARE DISEASES INFORMATICS PROGRAM (RDIP) SUPPORT,10505184,5N95021D00001,"['Affect', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Informatics', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Source', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'programs', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIDA,"AXLE INFORMATICS, LLC",N02,2021,1019720
"MEDICAL & PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS FOR DISASTER & EMERGENCIES AND ACTION COLLABORATIVE ON DISASTER RESEARCH RESPONSE Forum for Medical & Public Health Preparedness for Disaster & Emergencies and Action Collaborative.  Policy Context  There are many governmental agencies and private organizations charged with ensuring the Nation’s capacity to prevent and respond to the health effects that arise from disasters, both man-made and natural. While each of these stakeholders is critical in guaranteeing adequate prevention and response, their efforts must be coordinated to ensure optimal outcomes. However, the challenge arises from the diverse set of responsibilities of the primary stakeholders, the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and coordinating the efforts among the many other governmental agencies (federal, state, and local), industry, professional societies, foundations, academia, and other interested parties. Unfortunately, venues that bring all of these stakeholders together are limited. The NAS Forum for Medical and Public Health Preparedness began to address these issues in 2008. Aligning the responsibilities and focus of each stakeholder will greatly assist in ensuring adequate protection and response.  Each stakeholder offers unique assets that must be linked in to an overall strategy. It is here where the appropriate federal agencies, including the HHS, DHS, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, play a vital role in developing a National strategy and logistical support and coordinating with the private sector. The Forum for Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Disasters and Emergencies (the Forum) provides a venue where the major stakeholders may sit down together and discuss the primary issues, afford organizations the opportunity to make assessments, discuss policies, and review outcomes. These areas will focus not only on the immediate responses to disasters and public health emergencies, but also the intermediate and long term needs that arise (e.g. providing adequate shelter, food and water safety, primary care, mental health) during the recovery phase and efforts to enhance preparedness, cooperation and information sharing.  The activities of the federal government, volunteer organizations, the private sector, and others in the medical preparedness, resilience, and health sciences are of increasing complexity, both in terms of technology and policy.  Currently, it is difficult for the nation's medical emergency response and public and mental health systems to meet the physical and psychological needs that result from all types of disasters including terrorism and natural disasters. Unfortunately, gaps continue to exist in the following areas: (1 Global Health Security, (2) Communication and Coordination, (3) Personal and Community Resilience, and (4) Critical Infrastructure Protection. Addressing the physical, psychological, and social needs that result from various acts of terrorist events or natural disasters will therefore require universal preparedness by all systems responsible for the public's health. Preparedness, response, and recovery are required for all hazards and should include all segments of the population during each phase of the event. The research and development needs of these initiatives are immense and thus require the federal government to seek and coordinate assessment from both national and international clinical practice, as well as biomedical research communities.  Such coordination will require the best advice available as federal agencies seek guidance in developing its strategic plans for advancing the practice of medical preparedness.  These initiatives include scientific, technical, and workforce issues in the medical and public health arenas (infrastructure, clinical, environmental, and public health, research needs, including the development of new drugs and biologics and the collection and funding of critical data collection in a timely manner); effective training, education, and communication exercises; and evaluation of preparedness. The multiple and complex ethical issues surrounding these developing fields must also be considered.  	Technical Context   The forum will promote open discussion of existing systems and lessons learned from previous disasters and public health emergencies and identify areas for improvement.  These discussions exist across four broad categories: (1) Communication and Cooperation; (2) Personal and Community Resilience; (3) Preparedness and Infrastructure Needs; (4) Medical and Public Health Preparedness and Response; Within these areas, topics that might be on the meeting agendas of the forum include: Global Health Security Topics within this theme focus on the ongoing efforts to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from emerging infectious diseases and other threats.  Discussions concentrate on strengthening the U.S. health care and public health systems capacity to detect, prevent, plan for, respond to, and recover from naturally occurring outbreaks and intentional or accidental releases of dangerous substances. Communication and Cooperation: Topics within this theme focus on ensuring timely communications and effective coordination within all levels of government and between government, the private sector, and the public during large-scale disasters and incidents. Discussions concentrate on ways to improve situational awareness, threat intelligence sharing, risk communication, and collaboration among multi-sector disaster response networks including public, academic, private, governmental, and non-governmental entities, (e.g., improving coordination among disaster response networks from public, academic, private, and governmental entities and stakeholder data collection, harmonization, and management during and post disasters including acute surveillance and longitudinal exposure, health effects, clinical assessment, and evaluative data sets and information; organization and sharing of open data sets and development of computational tools to analyze the datasets (data science for discovery).  Personal and Community Resilience: According to the Implementation Plan for the National Health Security Strategy (2015-2018) (http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/planning/authority/nhss/Documents/nhss-ip.pdf), National health security is achieved when the Nation and its people are prepared for, protected from, respond effectively to, and are able to recover from incidents with potentially negative health consequences. Topics within this theme focus on issues related to the sustained ability of an individual and a community to utilize available resources to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations following a catastrophic event. Discussions concentrate on ways to enhance resilience for individuals and communities through disaster risk reduction, inclusion of health in post-disaster recovery planning efforts, working with non-traditional sectors, and exploring special considerations needed to strengthen a community after a mass casualty incident.    Critical Infrastructure Protection Topics within this theme focus on the ongoing efforts to secure the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, vital to the security, public health, and safety of the nation. Discussions center on the health care and public health sector and interdependent sector vulnerabilities, consequences of cascading and prolonged failures of infrastructure, threats from chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosives, and the increasing threat and consequences of cyber-attack, (e.g., investigating steps for building the next decade of disaster preparedness and simultaneously improving the public health infrastructure and addressing how existing public health systems and infrastructure can be strengthened while simultaneously moving forward to meet disaster response needs of the future).  Disaster Research Response Action Collaborative The Forum will convene an Action Collaborative on Disaster Science, based on the receipt of additional supporting funds from NIH and other sponsors to: 1) foster improved processes and platforms for developing and implementing needed time-critical data collection and research in response to disasters (“Science Preparedness”); 2) identify evidence-based mechanisms and opportunities for conducting and sharing information gathered from public health research during disasters; 3) engage cross-sector stakeholders in development, refinement, and promotion of disaster research opportunities and best practices; 4) provide a venue to support the development and maintenance of a rapid response mechanism for the National Academies to continue to meet sponsor needs for convening, idea generation and information sharing during the initial stages of a public health emergency. Activities of the Action Collaborative may include1) outlining and defining processes for conducting research (particularly research involving human subjects and at-risk populations) quickly following a disaster to avoid missing critical data; 2) ensuring community engagement and IRB/ethical considerations in disaster research. 3) defining processes for expanding and enhancing a coordinated network of disaster researchers; 3) assembling data collection, research, and best practice resources (or any other substantive products for the first year); 4) exploring appropriate venues to support the development and maintenance of a rapid response mechanisms for the National Academies and other platforms or forums to continue to meet sponsor needs for convening, generating ideas, and sharing information during the initial, as well as later stages of a public health emergency. Since 2008, the forum has held numerous meetings and workshops and published a number of documents regarding the issues listed above. Task Description:  The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NAS)) established a Forum on Medical Preparedness for Disasters and Emergencies (the “Forum”) in 2008.  Forums are designed to provide its members with a venue for exchanging information and presenting individual views, and allow a structured opportunity for dialogue and discussion while scrutinizing critical and possibly contentious scientific and policy issues.  Representatives from government, industry, academia, and other interested parties are expected to serve on the Forum, which will convene two to three times a year to confer on subject areas of mutual interest and concern.   At its meetings, the Forum identifies and discusses emerging scientific research and policy required to improve the Nation's medical preparedness and resilience to acts of terrorism and/or natural disasters, as well as issues in the coordination of federal, state, local, public, and private medical preparedness and resilience activities.  The Forum sponsors workshops as an additional mechanism for informing forum meetings and discussions.  The Forum may also commission individually-authored papers.   Forum discussions or workshops or other formats of meetings, may lead to proposals for specific studies by units of The National Academies resulting in institutional reports. Such studies, if undertaken, will be conducted independently and at arm’s length from the Forum and in accordance with all institutional policies and procedures governing such study activities.   All activities of the Forum will be conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines described in ""Roundtables: Policy and Procedures.""  In addition, with funding from NIH and possibly other sponsors, will support a Disaster Research Action Collaborative as an additional activity of the Forum.  For the past several years, NIH and others have sponsored a Standing Committee on Medial and Public Health Research during Large-Scale Emergency Events. After discussion with the sponsors and NASEM, it was decided to move from the Standing Committee to an Action Collaborative under the Forum. The Action Collaborative will work on outlining and defining processes and procedures for conducting research following disasters as described above. 	Expertise The Forum’s membership includes over 30 individuals, chosen for their professional and policymaking perspectives, as well as their scientific or public policy credentials.  Expertise includes government technical program management; medical operations in support of homeland security; biotechnology/bioengineering; strategic planning; threat assessment; toxicology; environmental health and geosciences; bioinformatics; national public health and emergency management and response; epidemiology; molecular biology; state/local public health; health care; risk communication; first responders; bioethics; nursing; pharmacotherapeutics, medical countermeasure planning and response, workforce education and training, health disparities and community engagement, data science and bioethics. Representatives of federal research and regulatory agencies are appointed by virtue of the positions they hold.  Additional experts are invited to participate in particular discussions on an ad hoc basis.   Each sponsor sends a primary representative and is welcome to also send “alternate” members. Currently Ms. Stacey J. Arnesen, NLM (Florence Chang, alternate) Barbara Mulach, NIAID, and Dr. Aubrey Miller, NIEHS, serve as NIH representatives to the forum.   The Action Collaborative will include members, chosen for their professional expertise in developing, conducting, and promoting disaster-related research as well as their general scientific and/or disaster medicine/public health/emergency management credentials.  Expertise may include grant management (e.g., as a Principal Investigator), emergency management, homeland security, environmental health and geosciences, toxicology, behavioral/psychosocial/mental health, data science/ bioinformatics, health care, public health, public policy, risk communications, health disparities and community engagement, and human subjects research/bioethics. 	Work plan The type of work that a forum, such as the Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Disasters and Emergencies, with mixed Federal, academic, not-for-profit, and industry for-profit participation can engage in include:  meetings and workshops on topics of interest to Forum members; symposia held for the purpose of informing Forum members more widely about medical and public health preparedness, response, and resilience consistent with Forum interests and discussions.  The Forum can also serve as a locus for informing each of its members of the views and plans of other members about approaches to problems and work on holding public events.  Specific activities will be organized according to the following tasks: 1.	Forum Meetings.  Forum Meetings will be held two or three times a year.  They will be open or closed as needed and attended by NAS staff and Forum members. 2.	Workshops or Other Activities Sponsored by the Forum.  The Forum will consider the use of several mechanisms to convene experts on topics in which it needs to be informed.  Examples of activities include workshops and active collaborations. The Projected Costs shown at the end of the proposal includes funding for these activities. 3.	Individually authored summary documents or proceedings of the Forum's workshops and symposia may be published by NAP or posted on the internet. n/a",MEDICAL & PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS FOR DISASTER & EMERGENCIES AND ACTION COLLABORATIVE ON DISASTER RESEARCH RESPONSE,10493043,63201800029I,"['Academia', 'Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department of Defense', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Federal Government', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geoscience', 'Government', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Policy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Private Sector', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Shelter facility', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terrorism', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training and Education', 'Transportation', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volunteer Organization', 'Water', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'chemical threat', 'clinical practice', 'community engagement', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'first responder', 'global health', 'hazard', 'health disparity', 'human subject', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'man', 'mass casualty', 'medical countermeasure', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'symposium', 'virtual']",OD,NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,N01,2021,10000
