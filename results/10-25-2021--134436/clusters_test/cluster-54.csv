"GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse Project Summary The GENCODE consortium creates foundational reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes in which all features are identified and classified with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and then freely released for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation. GENCODE seeks to create annotation that increases the understanding of genome function in both human and mouse by prioritizing human disease genes and respecting the role of mouse as the major mammalian model organism. To effectively annotate genomes, GENCODE has created a suite of tools and draws on deep expertise across its partners across four fundamental components: 1) a comprehensive gene annotation pipeline leveraging manual and computational annotation; 2) a set of computational methods to evaluate and enhance gene annotation; 3) experimental pipelines targeted to expressed sequences less detectable in standard protocols; and 4) a machine learning capacity to improve all facets of the project. GENCODE will maintain a major focus on protein-coding and non-coding loci, including their alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes and will extend expert manual review to small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and the annotation of non-polyadenylated transcripts. GENCODE will also expand regulatory annotation to a defined set of gene-associated features to more accurately reflect the interconnections between regulatory regions, including those with transcribed sequences such as ncRNA, and overall transcriptional output. GENCODE will take advantage of the increasing maturity of genomics technology including long-read transcriptome sequencing, functional genomics assays, and graph- based genome representations to identify features such as genes, pseudogenes, exons and splice sites that are incorrect, incomplete or in genome regions simply not present in the current reference assembly. More specifically, in the next four years GENCODE plans to 1) extend its human and mouse gene sets to as near completion as possible given available data and current experimental technology; 2) leverage new, high-quality human genome assemblies and targeted transcriptomic data to expand representation so that more human haplotypes will have high-quality annotation 3) annotate gene-associated regulatory regions including enhancer- promoter connections 4) collaborate with other resources to ensure a consistent representation of genic and regulatory features and reference transcripts for reporting clinical variation; and 5) distribute GENCODE annotations and engage with community annotation efforts to ensure accuracy and consistency. Primary GENCODE data will continue to be available from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers and the GENCODE web site. We will develop new mechanisms for effective two-way outreach, training and communication with the community with the long-term aim of establishing GENCODE as the standard annotation set for research and clinical genomics applications. Project Narrative The GENCODE project produces reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes. The annotation provides a reference from which to conduct clinical and genomics research in the short term; in the long term it informs all research that will contribute fundamental knowledge to benefit public health.",GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse,10186568,U24HG007234,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animal Model', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Update', 'Variant', 'base', 'community engagement', 'computational pipelines', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'outreach', 'promoter', 'reference genome', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2021,2973167
"Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents PROJECT SUMMARY An overarching goal of the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU- MMRRC) is to optimize and refine mouse models so that biomedical research using these models can proceed rapidly and effectively. The MU-MMRRC also conducts resource-related research, often collaboratively, to further refine and develop mutant mice and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics and associated microbiota for biomedical research. This proposal enhances the capacity of the MU MMRRC to further characterize and refine mouse models through characterization of biological material and enhance our capability to examine the role of infectious disease and the gut microbiome. In the immediate future this equipment will enhance our ongoing and proposed studies of COVID-19. As part of previous supplemental funding, the MU-MMRRC has succeeded in advancing this mouse strain as a model for human COVID-19, characterizing viral growth and the development of acute disease following intranasal and aerosol infection of mice with variations in gut microbiota and prior infection, recapitulating the disease in humans. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge from human samples the K18-hACE2 mouse will play a key role in evaluating pathogenesis and escape of immunity. As of May of 2021, there have been nearly 32 million survivors of COVID-19 in the United States. As an acute local and systemic inflammatory response is known to cause long-term post-infectious diseases such as chronic pulmonary and neurological diseases, the equipment requested for supplement funding will permit the MU-MMRRC an ability to further characterize and refine the mouse model for the benefit of short- and long-term biomedical research. In addition, this equipment will help the MU-MMRRC expand its ability to phenotype other mouse models in line with its long-term research goals of characterizing and optimizing mouse models by examining the effects of differing microbiota. Current equipment available for use in the BSL3 and ABSL3 laboratories is limited across the nation, effectively slowing COVID-19 research during this pandemic. Expanding the capacity of the BSL3 equipment resources available to analyze infected samples will allow the MU-MMRRC to continue to play a critical role in the biomedical research community and promote studies of pathogenesis for COVID-19. The objective of this proposal is therefore to provide several key pieces of equipment that are expected to be of use not only to COVID-19 researchers, but also provide flexibility to other researchers in the region and nation for studying disease pathogenesis in mouse BSL3 models. The resulting expansion of capabilities will be critical to research on these devastating diseases and on mouse models in general. Crucially, this equipment has use far beyond the pandemic and has been specifically chosen to enhance the parent grant’s research goals during this funding cycle and into future funding cycles. . PROJECT NARRATIVE The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU-MMRRC) develops tools to optimize and facilitate research using mouse models of disease. These include ongoing research and collaborative studies designed to optimize the understanding of a mouse model of COVID-19 through natural history studies, microbiota manipulation, and development of aerosol inoculation strategies. In this proposal the capabilities of the MMRRC for research within the state-of-the-art biocontainment facilities available at MU will be enhanced through the acquisition of equipment for sensitive, high throughput quantification of infection and disease state. The proposed equipment infrastructure will enhance the impact of the MMRRC and mouse modeling to accelerate our understanding of acute and post-infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to expand the current value-added services of the MU-MMRRC.",Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents,10405756,U42OD010918,"['2019-nCoV', '3-Dimensional', 'ACE2', 'Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Aerosols', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 pathogenesis', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Equipment', 'Facility Accesses', 'Film', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Long COVID', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Oocytes', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 variant', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'base', 'biocontainment facility', 'design', 'embryo quality', 'equipment acquisition', 'flexibility', 'germ free condition', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'instrument', 'live cell imaging', 'microbiota', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'pressure', 'repository', 'sperm cell', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,U42,2021,467993
"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models. These approaches will also be applied to investigate nuclear architecture in mouse models with mutations in genes relevant to nuclear structure, which will help advance our understanding of diseases such as laminopathy and cancer.",UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center,10265565,UM1HG011586,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Four-dimensional', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterochromatin', 'Hi-C', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lamin Type A', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'Whole Organism', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cell type', 'human data', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'knowledge translation', 'lamin B receptor', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleophosmin', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UM1,2021,2031051
"Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology Project Summary: The sensory cells of the inner ear, the hair cells, carry a bundle of precisely organized stereocilia bundles on their surface. Stereocilia are microvilli-like protrusions detecting sub-nanometer vibrations enabling our perception of sound. This incredible sensitivity requires an ensemble of proteins, some of which form mechanical linkages at the surface of stereocilia. These linkages have long been visualized with electron microscopy, however, the specific function of some remain elusive. This proposal focuses on a specific novel protein, Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), which is thought to be a major component of the stereocilia surface coat and is hypothesized to facilitate stereocilia bundle cohesion. To understand the spatiotemporal distribution of the protein throughout development, as well as the mechanism by which it causes deafness when mutated, multiple high-resolution light and electron microscopy experiments using different imaging modalities are being performed, resulting in a plethora of 2D and 3D images containing a wealth of data which unfortunately are costly to analyze in their entirety. Often generated to answer one question, such data sets could be shared with the scientific community for other groups to reuse for their research needs. As data collection becomes increasingly more expensive and time consuming, more groups join in sharing their raw data sets with the scientific community, in various formats often unsuitable for easy analysis. Advances in machine learning for computer vision has made it feasible to automate these manual analysis tasks, however the development of such models is heavily bottlenecked by the availability of training data which has been properly prepared and annotated. This supplemental proposal aims to increase the availability of such training data by annotating and depositing a wealth of imaging data in such a way that they may be readily used for the training of machine learning models. We will annotate three types of imaging data we collect from wild-type and ko mice to study the role of PKHD1L1 in hair cells: 1) cochlear hair cells on 3D confocal Z-stacks, 2) hair cell stereocilia and mitochondria in our 3D focused ion beam scanning electron micrograph volumes, and finally 3) stereocilia (in 2D) on our scanning electron micrographs of cochlear hair cell bundles. These annotations will be evaluated by our collaborators specializing in machine learning volumetric image segmentation to help us assess data biases, assess generalizability of our data annotation, and demonstrate the usability of the data in AI/ML applications through mini-AI/ML applications as a proof of concept. A special attention will be given to documenting our data and demonstrating their usability by retraining open-source machine learning algorithms both, with the help of our collaborators, and in-house. The data, annotations, documentation, and example use cases will be publicly hosted in open repositories. There is currently a dearth of machine learning work in the hearing field. By publicly releasing machine learning ready image data, our work will encourage the development of models that have the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency and throughput of future image analysis. Project Narrative – Public Health Relevance The goal of this study is to understand the function of Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), a novel hearing loss protein with no previous implications in hearing function. We show that absence of PKHD1L1 from the mouse inner ear sensory cells leads to a hearing loss, and understanding the mechanisms by which PKHD1L1-deficient mice develop a hearing loss is the central aim of this project. Identification and characterization of new hearing loss genes enhances the diagnostic potential for undiagnosed hereditary deafness cases in humans, and serves a foundation for developing candidate-based hearing restoration therapies.",Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology,10410746,R01DC017166,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Auditory Perception', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Cochlea', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dental crowns', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Hair Cells', 'Hearing', 'Height', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interferometry', 'Ions', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Labyrinth', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transmembrane Domain', 'Vestibular Hair Cells', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'cellular microvillus', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'deafness', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'genetic deafness', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing restoration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanotransduction', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'nanometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'protein distribution', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'repository', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'task analysis', 'tectorial membrane', 'usability', 'vibration']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,306359
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,10087916,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,495785
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10311650,R00EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R00,2021,245158
"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dental', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'critical period', 'design', 'differential expression', 'in silico', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'next generation', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10261436,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2021,1069526
"Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence PROJECT SUMMARY Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and high vulnerability to relapse even after prolonged abstinence. A major focus of the field of addiction research has therefore been to identify stable, cocaine-induced neuroadaptations occurring in brain reward circuits. Transcriptional changes are known to persist throughout abstinence, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of such persistence remain elusive. We recently discovered that the transcription factor, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4) represses cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Our preliminary data show that Nr4a1 is a central regulator of cocaine-induced transcription, including target gene expression in late abstinence. The significance of this study is strengthened by the utility of therapeutic agents that regulate Nr4a1 and block mouse cocaine self-administration, underscoring the enormous potential of this basic research program in combating drug addiction. Given that histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) confer long-lasting changes in gene expression necessary for stable cellular phenotypes, histone modifications acquired during abstinence may explain how individual genes “remember” prior drug exposure. We have previously found that Nr4a1 regulates hPTMs at individual target genes at late abstinence. This proposal aims to define the mechanism(s) of persistent gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice following volitional cocaine self-administration. We apply novel methods for cell-type specific quantification of both chromatin and gene expression in a single sample. We then validate the causal mechanism of Nr4a1 action using epigenetic editing in vivo. At the conclusion of this study we will have defined the cell-type specific mechanism by which Nr4a1 regulates stable gene expression across cocaine abstinence. Beyond this, we will apply machine learning to identify novel regulators of persistent gene expression relevant to cocaine addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE One outstanding question in addiction biology concerns the mechanism by which neurological changes persist long past the cessation of drug taking. The persistent nature of epigenetic modifications may underlie their role in chronic psychiatric diseases, such as addiction and depression. This proposal aims to define the molecular mechanisms by which a key neuronal transcription factor, Nr4a1, leads to long-term change in gene expression that persist across cocaine abstinence.",Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence,10297955,R01DA052465,"['Abstinence', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'CARTPT gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Female', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyltransferase', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Volition', 'Work', 'addiction', 'attenuation', 'cell type', 'cocaine exposure', 'cocaine self-administration', 'craving', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug abstinence', 'epigenetic profiling', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'neuroadaptation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'rat orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,679084
"Optogenetic dissection of cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction and amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in vivo SUMMARY A contributing factor to the failure of clinical trials has been the translational limitations of transgenic (TG) overexpression models in which physiological and endogenously-regulated pathogenic interactions are not achieved. In addition, standard behavioral tests may lack sensitivity to identify robust and reproducible behavioral deficits in newly develop knock-in (KI) models. To address or mitigate these limitations, we propose to study the next generation of newly developed KI mouse models of AD without transgene overexpression using the latest machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping and chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings. Specifically, we propose to study knock-in (KI) mice that express humanized Ab under the control of the mouse App locus with or without FAD mutations, including AppAβ/Aβ, AppNL-F/NL-F, and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice using state-of- the-art chronic in vivo electrophysiological recordings and machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping. The parent grant heavily focuses on the J20 TG model of AD, because App-KI mice show no prominent cognitive deficits in standard behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze test,10 and because it is unknown if App-KI have robust network abnormalities described in J20 and other TG-APP mouse models and AD patients, including altered gamma oscillations, theta-gamma coupling, epileptiform spikes and seizures.1,3,9,11- 15. The proposed experiments and genotypes expand the focus of our parent grant and will develop tools and procedures that will be directly used by the parent grant to improve behavioral and brain network characterization of TG and KI models of AD. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. Develop and apply machine learning approaches to identify behavioral alterations in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL- G-F AD mice. Aim 2. Determine electrophysiological phenotypes by chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings during aging and disease progression in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. Aim 3. Determine relationships between behavioral alterations and neuronal network dysfunction in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. In addition, this diversity supplement grant will significantly enhance the research potential of the candidate and further her ability to pursue a research career. The candidate will gain valuable relevant experience with electrophysiological data analysis and mouse behavioral assays during the funding period. These novel in vivo approaches and technical skills will help the candidate to address unexplored questions of AD pathogenesis, thereby creating a technical and conceptual path towards independence. The proposed supplement will provide the conceptual and technological foundation needed to support the production of preliminary data for the candidate’s future F32 grant application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes altered neuronal network activity and cognitive decline, but the underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction remain unclear. We will use state-of-the-art in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations of distinct inhibitory cell types and principal cells to identify cell, circuit, and network mechanisms of network dysfunction in the J20 and APP-KI mouse models.

"Development of a Predictive Frailty Clock & Longitudinal Investigation of its Epigenetic Determinants Project summary/abstract Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that a frailty clock that includes a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures (blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger, female mice of a different strain. To test this hypothesis I will complete a battery of health assessments, including blood collection for novel peptide biomarker detection, in male and female UM-HET3 mice every 3 months from 15 months of age until death. I will use regression modelling of all measured outcomes to develop an optimized `bAFRAID clock' that predicts time to death in mice. I will complete this part of the project at Harvard Medical School in the lab of Dr David Sinclair, who will act as my mentor and is an internationally recognised expert in the biology of aging. I will receive additional training in biomarker modelling and peptidomics from experts Drs Steve Horvath and Steve Gygi. For the independent phase of this award, I will use longitudinal assessments, and cutting-edge epigenetic tools to investigate the relationship between epigenetic changes and the AFRAID clock. This will increase our understanding of whether epigenetic mechanisms underly the onset of frailty in aging. The completion of this project and the proposed training will position me in an ideal position to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher with a lab focused on understanding the mechanisms of frailty in aging. Project Narrative This project aims to develop a new tool to assess the overall health of a mouse and predict early in a mouse's life when it will die. This assessment will be an important tool for the aging research field to increase the efficiency of studies looking at interventions to delay aging.",Development of a Predictive Frailty Clock & Longitudinal Investigation of its Epigenetic Determinants,10300833,K99AG070102,"['Acceleration', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Aging', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complete Blood Count', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Fractionation', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathology', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'frailty', 'health assessment', 'healthspan', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'sex', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,113405
"Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes. Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci, promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling. 3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of VCID. NARRATIVE The human brain is supplied by a dense array of vessels where each neuron has its supplying capillary. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature and thus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Our recent studies using heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice showed that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes, improving brain health.",Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange,10208361,RF1AG072295,"['Abbreviations', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Enzymes', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hyperemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Parabiosis', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Rejuvenation', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Vasodilation', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive function', 'cost estimate', 'density', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neurovascular', 'neurovascular coupling', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'restoration', 'transcriptomics', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,RF1,2021,1361358
"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: · continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, · leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a  common analysis pipeline, · develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and · support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities.

"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic.

Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10178133,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,422740
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,10102280,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38161
"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments.

"State-dependent Decision-making in Brainwide Neural Circuits Summary/Abstract Animals constantly make decisions, such as how to evaluate a potential threat or where to look for food. Yet the same animal in the same environment can produce different decisions on different occasions, because its internal state interacts powerfully with external inputs to determine behavior. This proposal’s overarching goal is to understand how internal states influence decisions and to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. In a mouse decision-making task, these experiments will examine the effects of three types of internal state changes: those arising spontaneously with engagement and disengagement in a task, those resulting from changing expectations during the task, and those resulting from learning within and across days. To determine how internal states affect brain activity and behavior, the team will apply cutting-edge technical advances on a brainwide scale, including statistical tools to infer internal states from behavior; simultaneous recordings from large populations of neurons across many regions during behavior and during optogenetic perturbations; assays that map functionally and molecularly defined cell-type-specific, cross-region connectivity; and computational approaches to model how cross-region neural communication depends on internal states. These ambitious goals go beyond the capabilities of an individual laboratory and are ideally suited for an already- productive consortium. This team is part of the International Brain Laboratory, which has already developed a standardized mouse decision-making task and standardized methods for training, neural measurement, and data analysis, along with a working, scalable infrastructure for sharing data. The proposed research leverages this existing infrastructure and takes it in a new direction. Projects 1-5 will examine simultaneously recorded population activity, evaluate causality, study neural activity and behavior during learning in normal and autism model mice, identify cell types by measuring neuronal activity, gene expression, and axonal projection patterns in the same populations of neurons, and build a comprehensive computational model of all these experimental results. Cores A-D will support the collection, replicability, management, and analysis of the large datasets produced by this brainwide examination of neural circuits. Taken together, the proposed research will rigorously define the neural basis of multiple internal states and evaluate their impact on the flow of decision-relevant information through the brain. The results will greatly advance the field by generating a comprehensive, mechanistic understanding of how internal states are reflected in the brain, and how these states interact with external inputs to guide decisions. Moreover, the team will produce and disseminate open-source tools and protocols that will enable other laboratories to collect and manage large-scale datasets produced through brainwide measurements. Project Narrative This ambitious experimental and theoretical collaboration will investigate how internal states (such as task engagement) influence decision-making, and identify the underlying neural mechanisms. The proposed work will produce an integrated, circuit-level model that explains decision behavior and neural activity in healthy and autism model mice, which show a reduced ability to make decisions that take changing expectations into account. Decision-making is also impaired in addiction and schizophrenia, so a deeper understanding of brainwide decision-making circuitry may contribute to future research on ways to treat or mitigate these disorders.",State-dependent Decision-making in Brainwide Neural Circuits,10294668,U19NS123716,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Bar Codes', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'data infrastructure', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source tool', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,U19,2021,3000000
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'dietary', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430
"Cell type atlasing of whole human brains using HOLiS: an optimized pipeline for staining, clearing, imaging, and analysis Project Summary (Abstract) Gaining a comprehensive understanding of brain-wide cellular organization in the human brain has long been recognized as a critical foundation for understanding complex brain functions, including who we are as humans. In this project we propose to take on this challenge and establish a pipeline capable of imaging the entire human brain at cellular resolution. We believe that the convergence of our novel technologies for tissue processing and clearing, ultra-fast 3D microscopy and highly efficient analysis will make this problem tractable and scalable, marking a new paradigm in human brain research. As part of BICCN, the Osten and Wu labs, have already made significant progress towards deciphering the cell type and three-dimensional organizational logic of the mouse brain, using both genetic and molecular labeling in combination with whole mouse brain imaging. However, scaling efforts ~2,000x from mouse to human brain requires both technical and conceptual innovation to extract maximum information and ensure high efficiency. Our approach will center on a new Human brain Optimized Light-Sheet HOLiS microscopy platform developed by the Hillman lab, whose speed, efficiency and multiplexing capabilities are expected to enable cellular- resolution imaging across the entire human brain in only a few days. The HOLiS platform is complemented by a new optimized tissue preparation method for human brain developed by the Wu lab, named HuB.Clear, optimized for multiplexed staining and clearing of highly tractable 5 mm thick, full human brain slabs. Our computational data analysis pipelines developed by the Osten lab will leverage deep learning-based data analysis and permit every cell in the brain to be registered within the whole brain 7T MRI volume. Our new human brain common coordinate framework will include cellular diversity analysis based on multiplex protein profiling and precise spatial characterization. The following benchmarks will be achieved during the 3-year project: Our tissue preparation method will provide: 1) complete tissue clearing while preserving morphology to allow faithful data production and integration with MRI, and 2) reliable and quantitative whole mount immunolabeling with diverse targets to allow multiplex molecular profiling across the entire brain. Our imaging technology will provide: 1) sufficient resolution and multiplexing capacity, and 2) high-throughput speed to allow exhaustive analyses across multiple whole human brains. Our data analysis methods will provide: 1) infrastructure capable of processing whole human brain imaging data, and 2) algorithms optimized for HOLiS to extract and interpret rich molecular and cellular information with the latest advances in computer science. The resulting pipeline will be easily scalable and sharable with maximized benefit-cost ratio, opening the door to imaging 100's or even 1,000's of human brains in coming years. Our results will link cellular diversity and morphology with molecular signatures across the entire human brain at a sufficient cellular resolution and to facilitate further functional investigations and cross-species comparisons in synergy with other BICCN efforts. Narrative Over the past decade, many techniques have been developed for mapping the brains of mice in exquisite detail, revealing the organization patterns of different types of cells and their connections with each other. However, we have yet to gain similar knowledge about the human brain, and have never before been able to evaluate an entire human brain in-toto at cellular resolution. Such data could teach us for the first time how the organization and structure of the human brain gives rise to behavior, emotion and cognition. In this project, we will leverage the latest technologies for tissue clearing, labeling, high-speed imaging and big-data analysis to establish a pipeline for imaging entire human brains rapidly and efficiently enough to permit wide-spread analysis and comparison of 100's of human brains with rich cellular and anatomical details in near future.","Cell type atlasing of whole human brains using HOLiS: an optimized pipeline for staining, clearing, imaging, and analysis",10377810,RF1MH128969,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data analysis pipeline', 'deep learning', 'exhaustion', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'preservation', 'protein profiling', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'synergism', 'targeted imaging', 'tissue preparation', 'tissue processing']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,RF1,2021,9121879
"CRCNS: Multiple Time Scale Memory Consolidation in Neural Networks Detailed description of the proposed use of the animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and number to be used; Dissociated, primary cultures will be prepared from the cortex of new born mice of either sex (mus musculus, Postnatal day 0-1). These experiments will be performed using pups obtained from Vglut1-IRES2-Cre strains mated with Floxopatch (Lou et al., 2016) strains so that pyramidal cells will express channel rhodopsin CheRiff and voltage indicator QuasR2. Up to 5 cultures can be grown, which can be used for 5 experiments. Justification for the use of animals, choice of species, and numbers to be used; Description of procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury; and Method of euthanasia and the reasons for its selection. Transgenic mice (category C) will be used because the experiments rely on the expression of CheRiff and QuasR2 for optical stimulation/recording. There are no alternative species.  All experiments are terminal. Newborn mice will be cooled in ice prior to cervical dislocation and excision of the brain for culture preparation. All procedures are in accordance with guideleines of the NYU Animal Welfare Committee.  The estimated number of animals below ensure that we have a continuous supply of cultures to perform experiments on a daily basis. Based on our experience in the past 3 years, each postnatal day 0-1 (P0-P1) mouse will generate at least 5 culture preparations. A viable culture will have a have a high density of neurons that express the Floxopatch construct, which varies from mouse to mouse. Thus, if one culture is not viable, all cultures derived from that mouse are also unusable. The success rate is approximately 50%. Because cultures can be made only form P0-1 day old mice and because it is not possible to determine whether expression is sufficient until the day of the experiment 2-3 weeks later, we will need to make 2 sets of cultures per week. Thus, we will need to maintain 2 breeding pairs per week or 8 breeding pairs per month to have a continuous supply of cultures. The breeding pairs will either consist of wildtype mice (for viral injection) or Vglut1-IRES2-Cre - Gt(ROSA)26Sor (floxopatch) mice. Breeding pairs will be replaced every six months. Total animals for experiments: 32 mice/year (=16 mice (8 breeding pairs) x 2/year replacement of breeding pairs). To maintain the 3 lines, 2 males and 2 females each of Vglut1-IRES2-Cre, Gt(ROSA)26Sor, and wildtype mice will be kept in separate cages (4+4+4=12 mice total). Every 6 months (twice per year), the mice of each type will be bred. From their offsprings, 4 males and 4 females from each line will be weaned and kept in separated cages as above (4+ 4 + 4 = 12) and the 4 original breeding pairs (12 mice) euthanized. Overall, 24 mice/year will be used to maintain the lines. Total mice/year: 56 (=24 mice/year to maintain lines + 32 mice/year for experiment). Total mice over 3 years = 168 mice.

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427
"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it. Project Narrative Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and for which there exists no effective cure. The current proposal has identified four major questions in the field of NEC which we now seek to answer, through a novel focus on identifying what causes NEC, how we can prevent NEC, how we can predict NEC, and how we can reduce the impact of NEC on causing long term complications on the brain, the gut and the lung.",Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis,10206378,R35GM141956,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laparotomy', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Premature Infant', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TLR4 gene', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Writing', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human tissue', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'intestinal epithelium', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ injury', 'prediction algorithm', 'premature', 'prevent', 'receptor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,409375
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,10242915,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,559400
"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,10250319,R01CA218664,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Greater sac of peritoneum', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Mucinous', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Ovarian', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Reproductive system', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serous', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'data fusion', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'ion mobility', 'ionization', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'uncertain malignant potential neoplasm']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,410432
"Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical radiobiology experiments on small animals are crucial to test the safety and efficacy before human clinical trials. However, limited by currently available technologies, preclinical animal studies substantially differ from state-of-the-art human treatments in dose conformity. Consequently, the animal studies poorly mimic the radiobiological, radioimmunological, and toxicity environment of human therapies. The disparity adversely affects our ability to meaningfully test hypotheses that are intended for human translation. With decades of advancement, human radiotherapy has achieved high targeting accuracy and dose conformality based on technological breakthroughs, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is unavailable for mouse experiments. A practical device and algorithm to modulate the x-ray intensity for the scale of small animals is the first step to bridge the gap. With the support of an NIH R21 grant, we engineered a novel small animal IMRT dose modulator termed sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC). Equally important as the hardware, we created the enabling mathematical tools to deliver SOC IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically miniaturized MLC-based IMRT. We commissioned and tested prototypical SOCs to deliver highly modulated doses in silico and on phantoms. Nonetheless, there are still large gaps between an intensity modulation device and a small animal IMRT system suitable for broad adoption and impact. The required time, resources, and training to create sophisticated SOC-IMRT plans are incompatible with preclinical settings. Furthermore, without automation, the existing image-guided small animal IMRT treatment is prohibitively slow for treating live animals under anesthesia. Lastly, the current manual method to switch between imaging and therapy modes results in intractable uncertainties in dose delivery. We propose to fill these gaps using automation, robotics, and system optimization. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1). Automated organ segmentation for mice using deep learning neural networks. Specific Aim 2 (SA2). Development of a fully functional, automated, and efficient IMRT system. Specific Aim 3 (SA3). Development and validation of a robotic Multi Mouse Automated Treatment Environment (Multi-MATE) for automated imaging and treatment. Besides dosimetry, we will quantify the time performance, which is critical to small animal IMRT system. As a result, in addition to improving the hardware accuracy and reliability, the proposed project will provide a fully automated planning and delivery system, thus removing the last barriers towards the broad adoption of small animal IMRT. The success of the proposed project will help existing research to achieve the full potential for human translation and enable future hypotheses testing where accurate complex dose distribution is critical. Project Narrative A major impediment in translating animal radiation studies to human patients is the disparity in radiation techniques. Existing methods cannot create human like conformal radiation dose on mice with necessary accuracy and efficiency. To better mimic human treatment without prohibitively complicated and slow procedures, we propose to develop a high throughput image guided small animal conformal irradiation platform.",Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research,10317441,R01CA259008,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'process optimization', 'robotic system', 'safety testing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,441662
