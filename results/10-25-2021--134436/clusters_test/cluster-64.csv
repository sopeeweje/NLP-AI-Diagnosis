"WormBase: a core data resource for C. elegans and other nematodes Project Summary WormBase is the major publicly available database of information related to Caenorhabditis elegans, an important organism for basic biomedical research, and other nematodes of medical and agricultural signficance. Although a crucial daily resource for members of the C. elegans research field, our users extend to the larger parasitology, biomedical, and bioinformatics research communities. WormBase acts as a central forum through which every research group can contribute to the global effort to comprehend nematode genomes and biology. Most users access WormBase via the Internet (www.wormbase.org); some install the database locally. WormBase offers extensive coverage of C. elegans core genomic, genetic, anatomical and functional information, allowing the biomedical community to fully utilize the results of intensive molecular genetic analyses and functional genomic studies of this organism in the study of human disease. These data include all available nematode genomic data (such as genome sequence, transcripts and cis-regulatory sites prioritized by species), large-scale functional genomic datasets, the function and interactions of genes and gene products as they relate to development, physiology and behavior, and biological reagents and their source information. WormBase comprises a set of databases storing a wide range of biological information; a website that allows users to access stored information and precomputed analyses based on these data; and tools for programmatic access such as an application programming interface, a data mining platform, and bulk downloads. Curation activities include extraction and integration of information from the literature (assisted by the use of information retrieval tools), incorporation of large-scale datasets from a range of research projects, and gene model verification from experimental data. We will curate many nematode genome sequences, along with their annotations and core genetic information, as well as data on gene function, pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks for C. elegans and select other species. We will expand tools available for data mining, workflow management, visualization, and community annotation, and integrate, store and distribute data in a maintainable, interoperable and scalable system. The project team involves three sites: Caltech primarily curates functional information and develops ontologies; EBI carries out sequence-based curation and builds databases for public release; and OICR develops and supports the web presence and visualization. The three sites work closely together and share tasks to ensure timely incorporation, storage and display of information, as well as user outreach and education. Project Narrative Nematodes (roundworms) are major parasites of humans, livestock and crops, and understanding how to control them is a major world health and economic challenge. One species of nematode, C. elegans, is extensively used for basic biomedical research to elucidate how networks of genes affect cells, organs, and whole anima development, physiology and behavior to understand human disease. WormBase collects, stores and displays information about the genomes and genes of C. elegans and other nematodes to facilitate research about this diverse and important group of animals.",WormBase: a core data resource for C. elegans and other nematodes,10227167,U24HG002223,"['Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Livestock', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'World Health', 'WormBase', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'complex data', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'design', 'distributed data', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'gene product', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genome resource', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health economics', 'human disease', 'information display', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'light weight', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'reference genome', 'relational database', 'social media', 'symposium', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U24,2021,2053636
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,10206222,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,550000
"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites,10212798,U01HG011717,"['Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiometabolic Disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Creatine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Funding', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heredity', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Jamaican', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lipids', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'North America', 'Northern Africa', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'lifestyle data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality', 'multi-ethnic', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'prevent', 'tool', 'trait', 'working group']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2021,958531
"MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application) Project summary – MADIVA: Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application Research Hub Our research hub will develop data science to address the complex interplay, individual and public health challenges, and rising prevalence of multimorbidity in Africans. Epidemiological transition in Africa has greatly changed health risks at both individual and public health levels. Trauma, infectious & non- communicable diseases are major health challenges; multiple occurrences multiply burdens for individuals and communities. The inherent value from the increasingly rich and varied existing data has not been exploited. We have rich longitudinal epidemiological data sets, partial but increasingly available clinical and laboratory records, and genomic data. The data, as is common in the domain, is highly heterogeneous, and in parts, fragmented and incomplete. The Hub will be led by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg collaborating with the African Population and Health Research Center (Nairobi, Kenya), IBM Research Africa, the South African Population Research Infrastructure Network and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The initial sites are an urban population in Nairobi, and a rural, transitioning, site in Bushbuckridge, South Africa: each has rich longitudinal data of >100,000 individuals. Although incomplete, clinical records are increasingly being captured digitally. Notably there is genomic data from a subset of individuals at each of the sites. Multimorbidity is inherently multi-factorial — fragmented unlinked data retards solutions. Project 1 focuses on linking. Integrated data sets will aid in understanding these communities, representative of many in Africa, and protocols developed will be applicable elsewhere. A researcher dashboard will allow researchers to find data and plan projects. A clinic dashboard will help clinic managers and health officials to monitor and plan effectively. Project 2 will be solution-oriented to develop novel data science methods to provide actionable insights. We will develop robust methods for risk profiling of individuals and communities using heterogeneous data. We pioneer the use of polygenic risk scores in Africa. Key data science questions are explicability of results and managing high-dimensional data without loss of power. An innovative aspect of our grant will be translational work with public precision health to provide insights into drug dispensing, pharmacogenomics, and behavioral or possible social interventions. The Capacity Development & Pilot Project Core will support a tiered set of pilot projects for African researchers at different career stages, leveraging our strong research platforms and networks. We aim to build capacity in key areas including incubation and cost modelling for data science. The Administrative and Leadership Core will provide the necessary leadership and project management and linking to other DS-I components. The Data Management and Analysis Core will develop protocols for the responsible sharing of data, data quality control, technical support as well as innovate new analysis techniques. The MADIVA Research Hub will develop data science techniques and solutions to tackle the problem of multimorbidity in Africa – the problem of multiple co-occurring diseases significantly adding to the health burden in Africa. Our primary research sites in rural Bushbuckridge, South Africa and urban Nairobi, Kenya each have rich data sets from longitudinal studies collected by the health and demographic surveillance systems based there, together with a nascent set of clinical health records and genomic data. We will develop and apply data science techniques to link the different data sets, build dashboards for different stakeholders and apply new machine learning techniques to automatically stratify populations for risk profiles to different diseases, including the use of polygenic risk scores.","MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application)",10314291,U54TW012077,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Store', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Urban Population', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'data visualization', 'design', 'digital', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene environment interaction', 'genomic data', 'health record', 'heterogenous data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'metadata standards', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'social interventions', 'software development', 'tool']",FIC,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",U54,2021,1199339
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,10130561,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,466290
"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A.

"Toward  a  deeper  understanding  of  allostery  and  allotargeting  by  computational approaches Toward a deeper understanding of allostery and allotargeting by computational approaches Understanding allosteric mechanisms of action and their modulation by ligand binding (allo- targeting) gained importance in recent years, as allosteric modulators allow for selective interference with specific protein-protein interactions (PPI) or cellular pathways. Yet, despite the growth of data and methodologies, we still lack a solid understanding of allosteric mechanisms that underlie biological function. We propose that a completely new framework, with focus on the change in structural dynamics rather than changes in the states only, is needed. Furthermore, rather than limiting our attention to transitions between two end-states (e.g. open/closed forms of a protein), one needs to consider the complete ensemble of conformers, and evaluate the effect of intermolecular interactions or mutations vis-à-vis the changes elicited in the conformational landscape. Toward this goal, we propose to develop, implement, and apply innovative computational models and methods that will focus on the essential dynamics of biomolecular systems. Essential dynamics refers to the global modes of motions intrinsically accessible to the overall structure, i.e. they cooperatively engage most, if not all, structural elements of the biological assembly. We propose to: (1) develop, test, and validate an essential site scanning analysis (ESSA) methodology for predicting ‘essential’ sites that dominate the essential dynamics, and discriminating allosteric sites among them (Aim 1), (2) enhance the capability and accuracy of our pathogenicity predictor, RHAPSODY, for evaluating the impact of mutations (single amino acid variants) on biological function, by including in our machine learning algorithm the features derived from global motions of biomolecular systems, the signature dynamics of protein families, and the experimentally resolved PPIs (Aim 2), and (3) develop a hybrid methodology for efficient assessment of conformational landscapes applicable to proteins containing cryptic sites and cryo- EM structures (Aim 3), and finally extend and integrate these new methodologies to enable their efficient translation to biomedical and pharmacological applications. Method development, testing, validation, and further extensions will entail rigorous benchmarking against other methods and/or relevant databases where applicable, in addition to detailed case studies in collaboration with other labs (see support letters from six experimental and one computational collaborator). Integration of the methodologies within our well-established application programming interface ProDy will enable efficient dissemination and wide usage of the new technologies by the broader community. Narrative Recent years have shown that the structural dynamics of biomolecular systems is essential to biological actions and interactions in the cell, and it is critically important to identify the sites controlling the structural dynamics so as to design effective modulators of function and assess the impact of mutations. With this perspective, we aim to develop novel computational methods and tools to predict allosteric sites and essential mechanisms, assess the pathogenicity of point mutations, and assist in the design of effective intervention methods for modulating biological function and allo-targeting. These tools will be made accessible to the broader community through our widely used ProDy interface to enable effective usage and dissemination.",Toward  a  deeper  understanding  of  allostery  and  allotargeting  by  computational approaches,10231654,R01GM139297,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allosteric Site', 'Amino Acids', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Four-dimensional', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'cryptic protein', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'multi-scale modeling', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'paralogous gene', 'pharmacophore', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'simulation', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,344045
"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),10170251,U01AI151807,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Animals', 'Arbovirus Infections', 'Arboviruses', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brazil', 'Central America', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Deforestation', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Habitats', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Panama', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'South America', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Venezuela', 'Virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'Zoonoses', 'chikungunya', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'emerging pathogen', 'enzootic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'insight', 'nanobodies', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prospective', 'seroconversion', 'surveillance network', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector control', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2021,1519214
