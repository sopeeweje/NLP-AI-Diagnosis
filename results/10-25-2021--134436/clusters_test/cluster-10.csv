"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short-to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one-third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third- order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARSCoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10395043,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Therapeutic', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'coronavirus disease', 'drug candidate', 'high risk', 'in silico', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R21,2021,245839
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,10232126,UH3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'complex data', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UH3,2021,1000
"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10250537,K99EB028840,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biosensor', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Euthanasia', 'Event', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Extravasation', 'Flare', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foreign Bodies', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homing', 'Hydrogels', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Implant', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraxis', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'Proteolipids', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'caprolactone', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'experience', 'fluorophore', 'glucose monitor', 'imaging approach', 'immunoengineering', 'immunological status', 'implant material', 'implanted sensor', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'liquid biopsy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'optical sensor', 'personalized approach', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'small molecule', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2021,91800
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently emerged as an exciting new treatment modality resulting in complete tumor regression in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% of HNSCC patients show any long-term survival benefit.

"Vectra Polaris microscope imaging system PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks funding for a Vectra® Polaris™ Automated Quantitative Imaging System (Polaris™), a state- of-the-art multispectral imaging microscope to serve multiple NIH-supported projects within the Mycobacteria Research Laboratories (MRL) at Colorado State University (CSU). Our collective mission is to develop effective chemotherapies and vaccines for mycobacterial diseases affecting millions worldwide. The biological activity and safety profile of candidate vaccines and treatments can only be fully understood through characterizing the host immune response, primarily by evaluating large networks of immune biomarkers through flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. MRL researchers are seeking to visualize the spatial expression of immune biomarkers by multiplex staining of intact tissue samples obtained from preclinical models of mycobacterial diseases. Until now, microscopic analysis of biomarkers through confocal and traditional immunofluorescence was drastically limited by autofluorescence in tissue (especially in formalin fixed and diseased tissue) and low signal-to-noise ratios. The Polaris™ system has a unique set of microscopic capabilities that combined with the inForm® workstation allows simultaneous identification and quantification of multiple targets and their spatial relationships in tissue sections and microarrays. A critical aspect of the PolarisTM multispectral technology is the ability to readily distinguish autofluorescence from positive biomarker signal, improving the signal-to-noise ratio substantially. This allows for a more sensitive and accurate analysis of samples and enables true cell-to-cell interactions to be revealed. The system is user-friendly, and its automated scanning system allows for high speed digital and whole-slide scanning between 10-40x in brightfield or fluorescence. The nature of the illumination system significantly decreases deleterious effects such as photobleaching and photodamage, and thus specimens can be imaged for longer periods of time than with, for example, a confocal microscope. Furthermore, the advanced machine-learning based approaches of the included software automatically segment and quantitate tissue structures. The Polaris™ system will be incorporated into our existing microscopy core facility in order to expand access to trainees and other research groups at CSU and in Northern Colorado, while prioritizing access for the major users. Incorporation into the foundational core will sustain long term operation and provide consistent oversight and training. In summary, this state-of-the-art imaging technology is of critical importance to development of chemotherapies and vaccines by the MRL and will add value to multiple other NIH-supported projects at CSU. Narrative Here we will use multiplex staining of intact tissue samples and advanced machine-learning based approaches to understand the spatial relationships of biomarkers of disease and therapy. This knowledge will help in understanding immune pathogenesis of disease and in defining the biological activity and safety profile of candidate vaccines and chemotherapies.",Vectra Polaris microscope imaging system,10175807,S10OD030263,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Communication', 'Colorado', 'Computer software', 'Core Facility', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genus Mycobacterium', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Photobleaching', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'microscopic imaging', 'mycobacterial', 'operation', 'quantitative imaging', 'spatial relationship', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine candidate']",OD,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,S10,2021,451750
"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

"Hyperplexed Quantum Dots for Multidimensional Cell Classification in Intact Tissue ABSTRACT The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal is to develop fluorescent labels for single-cell classification through imaging of intact three-dimensional tissue. We are focusing on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), nanocrystals that exhibit bright fluorescence and unique optical and electronic properties. We designed new classes of QDs which we propose will allow quantitative, multispectral analysis of 30 or more distinct molecules so that hyperspectral light sheet microscopy can be used to proteomically profile and comprehensively map 20 or more distinct cell types throughout an intact tissue after a single staining step. This technology addresses an outstanding bottleneck in optical microscopy of three-dimensional tissue, for which only 3 distinct molecular markers can be easily distinguished, limiting the capacity to precisely classify cell types and to co-localize different cell types. This proposal comes at a time when new light sheet microscopes have recently become widely available for full-thickness imaging of optically cleared tissues at sub-cellular resolution such that rapid advances in multiplexing could yield rapid impacts. As an example, the investigators of this project developed workflows to optically clear, immunolabel, and image intact adipose tissues from lean and obese rodent models, in addition to software to comprehensively identify cells based on fluorescent immunostains, and deep learning algorithms to automate microenvironment segmentation. With these advances, we were able to discover new classes of immune microenvironments in adipose tissue that are believed to promote comorbidities of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However key hypotheses regarding the nature of these microenvironments cannot be readily addressed until we can discretely categorize cells based on their molecular expression patterns within their contextual microenvironments. In this proposal, our technological goal is to develop fluorophores for high-content multiplexing in intact tissues. Our biological goal is to use these tools to understand immune cell microenvironments that regulate adipose tissue in the state of obesity. Our Specific Aims are to (1) engineer the photophysics of new classes of QD-based labels, (2) conjugate these labels to antibody fragments and validate their target specificity as molecular probes, (3) quantitatively evaluate cell labeling and classification accuracy in three-dimensional adipose tissue, and (4) apply probe panels to quantify adipose immune microenvironments at the cellular level in the lean and obese states. This is a collaborative proposal between engineers and scientists with expertise in quantum dots and molecular probes (Andrew Smith), advanced optical microscopy (Paul Selvin), biomedical image computing (Mark Anastasio), cellular immunology (Erik Nelson), and animal models of obesity (Kelly Swanson). NARRATIVE Classification of cells within human tissues is essential for understanding states of health and disease. In this proposal, we will develop a new class of fluorescent label that increases the number of molecular classification markers for cells by an order of magnitude. These labels function within intact, three-dimensional tissue, an attribute that we will use to map the local environments of adipose tissue immune cells that are thought to determine comorbid outcomes of obesity.",Hyperplexed Quantum Dots for Multidimensional Cell Classification in Intact Tissue,10317961,R01EB032249,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Cytometry', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quantum Dots', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cell dimension', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorophore', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'molecular marker', 'nanocrystal', 'optical imaging', 'tool', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,540651
"A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder PROJECT ABSTRACT  The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. It has led to an increased incidence of opioid overdose, injection substance use, and, eventually, HIV transmission. More than 171,000 people in the United States are living with HIV as a result of substance use disorder (SUD). Despite the known fact that both HIV and SUD significantly disturbs both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, their underlying molecular mechanisms, and interplay to immune dysfunction remain unexplored. Comprehensive functional characterization at a single-cell resolution is essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of immune dysfunction up HIV infection and SUD. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR- seq) with high-dimensional, multi-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the transcriptional, epigenetic, and network alterations and to key immune dysfunction drivers associated with HIV and SUD. Specifically, we will (1) Integrate novel functional genomics assays with single-cell multi-omics data to construct cell-type-specific multi-modal gene regulatory network (GRNs) in healthy individuals, (2) build a comprehensive immune profiling data hub for HIV/SUD-affected individuals and construct disease- and cell-type-specific GRNs, (3) uncover how key network changes and aberrant behaviors of TFs upon HIV infection and/or SUD can lead to immune dysfunction. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on transcriptome analyses, this proposed work presents a genuinely novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles at a single-cell resolution. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements at a single-cell resolution will expand the number of known functional regions. The constructed immune cell atlas, GRNs, and identify key drivers of immune dysfunction will be accessible to the public via web services and annotation databases. Our integrative computational efforts will be released distributed open-source programs. Altogether, our released resource will accelerate research in the broader scientific community by providing essential tools to investigate immune function, which will benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of immune system function of HIV and/or SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage high-dimensional, multi-scale, and highly heterogeneous genomics data to discover the essential molecular alterations of immune cells introduced by HIV and/or substance use disorder (SUD) at a single-cell resolution. In contrast to existing methods that rely on either transcriptome or epigenome only, this work assumes that several key transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network alterations jointly occur with HIV and/or SUD, resulting in immune system dysfunction. Hence, we propose a computational framework to depict the comprehensive immune cell regulome, construct molecular networks of various cell types, and pinpoint key immune dysfunction driver events at a single-cell resolution.","A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder",10214582,R01DA051906,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hi-C', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humoral Immunities', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural Immunity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Psychological Transfer', 'PubMed', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data hub', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'immune system function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health emergency', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'substance use', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'web services']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,572929
"T cells in the aging brain SUMMARY The overarching goal of this project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’. However, recent studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, and could this knowledge be used to restore functionality of old brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases?  The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain provides a great paradigm to address this question, as this regenerative region of the brain contains many different cell types – neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial cells, microglia – and exhibits clear functional decline during aging. To gain a single cell understanding of the changes that occur with age in neurogenic niches, we recently performed single cell RNA-sequencing of young and old neurogenic niches in mice. This analysis revealed a striking infiltration of cytotoxic T cells only in the old neurogenic niche, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from old SVZs are clonally expanded and secrete interferon g (IFNg), suggesting that they have encountered specific antigens. We also showed that T cells can impair NSC proliferation both in co-cultures and in vivo. Based on these data, our specific hypothesis is that T cell clonal expansion in old brains drives the deterioration of the neurogenic niche with age, and that preventing this T cell expansion restores function to old neurogenic regions. Probing this idea would be critical to counter the decline in brain function during aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following experiments: 1. To determine how T cells infiltrate neurogenic niches in old individuals; 2. To understand the functional impact of T cells on old neurogenic niches; 3. To examine the interaction between immune cells and neurogenic niches in young, old, and rejuvenated individuals.  Completion of these aims will provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of T cell and other immune cells during aging in regenerative niches of the brain. This work should also give a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic impact of the interferon response and T cell cytotoxicity on different cell types in the brain. Knowledge from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including new immunotherapies, for the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain function during aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE As the organism ages, adult regenerative neural stem cell niches no longer produce new neurons. Adult neurogenic niches have been found to be important for aspects of learning and memory, raising the intriguing possibility that boosting the production of neurons by these niches may help preserve or enhance cognitive function with advancing age. Uncovering the immune-based mechanisms underlying the decline and rejuvenation of adult neurogenic niches during aging should give important insights into the factors that control regeneration in the normal aging nervous system as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",T cells in the aging brain,10184422,R01AG071711,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Rejuvenation', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T cell regulation', 'T-Cell Depletion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'functional decline', 'functional restoration', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuroblast', 'neurogenesis', 'normal aging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'regenerative', 'response', 'restoration', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell proliferation', 'subventricular zone', 'transcriptome']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,752242
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research.

"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and nonneutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. These studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines. Collectively, these studies will provide the first insights on the cross-species correlates of immunity against COVID-19 to support the development of vaccines. Additionally, this work may also lead to the development of novel therapeutics with unique immunomodulatory impact on viral infection/disease",Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19,10265799,R37AI080289,"['Adenoviruses', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ferrets', 'Future', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Passive Transfer of Immunity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 immunity', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 spike protein', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'System', 'Translating', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protective efficacy', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R37,2021,355594
"Gradient biomaterials to investigate niche regulation of hematopoiesis ABSTRACT Replicating the cascade of signals responsible for controlling stem cell behavior remains a critical challenge for biology and medicine. Hematopoiesis is the process where the body’s blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation take place in, and are regulated by, unique regions of the bone marrow termed niches. HSCs are also the functional unit of therapeutic bone marrow transplants following myeloablative therapies. A major goal of the hematology community is to selectively expand HSCs without sacrificing a subpopulation of quiescent, long-term repopulating HSCs required for life-long hematopoiesis. Perivascular niches (PVNs) within the bone marrow are increasingly believed to present a constellation of matrix, biomolecular, and metabolic signals to support HSC expansion and quiescence, however their rarity and complexity can complicate direct in vivo examination. The long-term goal of this Stimulating Hematology Investigation – New Endeavors (SHINE) project is to advance a tissue engineering platform to achieve HSC expansion without exhaustion. In the previous funding period (R01DK099528), we established a tissue engineering ecosystem to examine the coordinated impact of niche- inspired biophysical signals and marrow-derived niche cells on HSC fate. We showed the kinetics of HSC-niche cell crosstalk can be manipulated via biomaterial design to dramatically alter HSC fate decisions. And we developed machine learning tools to identify secretome signals generated by niche-associated MSCs that enhance retention of quiescent HSCs. We build on these findings to investigate the coordinated effect of multicellular crosstalk, cell-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling, and hypoxic stress within the perivascular niche using biomimetic models of marrow sinusoidal vs. arteriolar vascular niches. The overall objective of this project is to define patterns of multicellular signaling and remodeling within an engineered PVN biomaterial in order to identify synthetic niches that promote HSC expansion without exhaustion. To address this goal we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will subsequently resolve patterns of niche remodeling and HSC-PVN crosstalk in response to hypoxia (Aim 2). And we will establish a microdroplet-based artificial marrow niche to encapsulate single murine HSCs in nanoliter-volume hydrogel droplets (Aim 3). Throughout, we will benchmark patterns of in vitro HSC expansion via the gold standard in vivo competitive repopulation assay. This proposed research is unified in our focus to use the well- characterized murine hematopoietic system to develop engineered niche technologies for HSC expansion. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the SHINE program, we will generate innovative tissue engineering infrastructure to define dynamic processes of remodeling and intercellular HSC-niche crosstalk necessary to achieve durable HSC expansion without exhaustion. NARRATIVE The body’s full complement of blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in regions of the bone marrow termed niches. Niches provide diverse and dynamic matrix, metabolic, and cell-cell communication signals to regulate HSC stemness.

"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,10075214,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic autoantibodies', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,416371
"Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in pregnancy PROJECT SUMMARY Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned adaptations of the maternal immune system to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus, which appear to be imbalanced in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the pregnancy context, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via the sympathetic nervous system, while its role in modulating maternal immune system adaptations during pregnancy remains unknown. Understanding the determinants of immune regulation throughout pregnancy is a prerequisite to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies. This research project proposes to target the interaction between the brain, pregnancy, and the immune system. State-of-the-art immunology (mass cytometry) and neuroscience (neuromodulation of discrete neuronal circuitry) approaches will be combined to comprehensively investigate neuroimmune regulation of human term and preterm pregnancies and mouse models of pregnancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a hyperactive sympathetic (adrenergic) tone enhances systemic pro-inflammatory monocyte responses, thereby contributing to a compromised fetal tolerance in preterm pregnancies. The first aim of this proposal will monitor the responsiveness innate pro-inflammatory monocytes to adrenergic signals (using single-cell high-dimensional mass cytometry), and the nervous-system associated proteome (e.g., adrenergic analytes, Brice Gaudilliere lab) throughout the human third trimester. This aim is based on my current expertise in human pregnancy immunology and multi-parameter approaches, and a continuation of my prior in-depth analyses of the pre-labor plasma signature and immunome in the last 100 days of healthy pregnancy, which accurately predict the onset of labor. In aim 2, to understand brain-pregnancy communication on a mechanistic level, neuroscience approaches (fiber photometry and chemogenetics) will be used under supervision of the Luis de Lecea lab, who pioneered cutting-edge neuro-modulatory techniques. Here, I will manipulate discrete neural populations, known to either suppress or enhance peripheral immunity, throughout late gestation in mouse pregnancies with the aim to monitor their link to peripheral monocyte responsiveness. Reciprocally, fiber photometry will track pregnancy- specific alterations in activity of these neural populations. In the third and final aim 3, I will determine whether monocyte responses to sympathetic signals differ throughout preterm vs. term pregnancies by analyzing maternal blood collected in each trimester of pregnancy, using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to train a model for preterm vs. term sample classification. In the independent R00 phase, I envision to apply techniques from immunology and neuroscience to understand pregnancy biology and pathology from a central nervous system perspective. Together, the set of proposed studies will answer fundamental questions in the nascent field of brain- peripheral immunity cross-talk, and elucidate understudied mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation in pregnancy, while significantly aiding in my career development and academic transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned maternal immune adaptations to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi- allogeneic fetus, which appear to be disrupted in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the context of pregnancy, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via sympathetic signals but strikingly, its role in modulating the maternal immune dynamics during pregnancy remains unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate whether sympathetic (adrenergic) signals regulate innate immune responses during mouse, and human term and preterm pregnancies, with the aim to elucidate neuroimmune mechanisms of brain-pregnancy interaction – a key step to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies.",Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in pregnancy,10192367,K99HD105016,"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Age', 'Allogenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CREB1 gene', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cytometry', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Fetal Resorption', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'Gestational Age', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperactivity', 'Immune', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Isoproterenol', 'Labor Onset', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroimmune', 'Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Phenylephrine', 'Photometry', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Maintenance', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Sympathectomy', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cross immunity', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experience', 'fetal', 'healthy pregnancy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'paraventricular nucleus', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive test', 'pregnancy immunology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,131652
"The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition Globally, undernutrition contributes to 44% of childhood deaths under the age of five 1. Stunting, or reduced linear growth, is a major complication of undernutrition that is associated with increased risk of metabolic and infectious disease, reduced educational attainment and poor cognitive function later in life 3. Stunted mothers are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and to give birth to stunted children 5. In turn, many children that are born stunted do not recover despite current therapeutic interventions 4. Therefore, stunting is often referred to as an intergenerational syndrome, and new approaches are desperately needed to improve childhood growth in vulnerable populations. The maternal immune system plays a major role in shaping offspring physical, cognitive and immune development. The gut microbiota likewise influences both local and systemic immunity, raising the possibility that the maternal microbiome could influence fetal and childhood development. We hypothesize that maternal gut microbial composition shapes the fetal immune environment to control offspring growth and immune development during undernutrition. We propose to use a mouse model of intergenerational undernutrition to identify specific immune and microbial targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary data demonstrate that breeding mice colonized with microbiota from healthy or severely stunted donors produce offspring with divergent weight, bone, and immune developmental phenotypes that persist into maturity. We will use this model to isolate the role of the maternal gut microbiome from the neonatal microbiome, giving critical insight into the window of potential intervention. We will also identify specific subsets of microbes that are capable of influencing offspring growth and immune development and characterize microbial metabolic products associated with these changes. Finally, we will identify maternal immune cells and signaling pathways that respond to these microbial communities to control healthy growth and immune development in offspring. These experiments will identify specific microbial species as well as host immune pathways to target therapeutically and define the appropriate developmental stage in which to intervene. The Cowardin lab is located within the Child Health Research Center at the University of Virginia, and as a member of the Trans- University Miocrobiome Initiative, is uniquely suited to pursuing these studies. The lab has both the infrastructure and expertise required for successful completion of these goals. Ultimately, this proposal will lead to potential probiotic and immunotherapeutic treatments to disrupt the transmission of stunting from mother to child. Childhood undernutrition is a pervasive problem worldwide, resulting in reduced linear growth (stunting), increased risk of disease and cognitive defects that persist into adulthood. Maternal health profoundly influences fetal and childhood development, and mothers that are stunted are more likely to give birth to stunted children. Because gut microbes influence growth and immune function, we propose to investigate the role of the maternal microbiota in shaping offspring health, with the goal of identifying specific microbial species and immune pathways for targeted intervention to ameliorate the global burden of undernutrition.",The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition,10276044,R01HD105729,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior Control', 'Birth', 'Bone Growth', 'Breeding', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Infant Health', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lymphoid', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Malnutrition', 'Maternal Health', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Probiotics', 'Productivity', 'Rag1 Mouse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'bone', 'chemokine', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'progenitor', 'pup', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tomography', 'transmission process']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,348349
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of neurological disease.",Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures,10177640,R01NS120926,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogens', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Mediating', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,643473
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,10234145,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2021,464920
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,10168567,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,321398
"Clinical, imaging, and endoscopic outcomes of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic goals in pediatric Crohn’s Disease (CD) have shifted from clinical improvement or remission to endoscopic healing (EH) by ileocolonoscopy and transmural healing (TH) by magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This shift happened because patients who achieve complete healing (CH, TH and EH) experience lower rates of subsequent hospitalization, therapy escalation, or surgery than those with EH alone or no healing. We hypothesize that specific pre-treatment clinical, radiologic, genomic, and microbial factors along with attainment of targeted anti-TNF biologic exposure will be associated with the primary endpoint, CH, and the major secondary endpoints, EH and TH, 52 weeks after anti-TNF start.. We will test this hypothesis in a prospective cohort study of 570 newly diagnosed pediatric-onset CD subjects who initiate treatment with anti-TNF medication within 6 months of diagnosis. We will administer personalized anti-TNF biologic therapy guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using a novel dosing algorithm which we developed. Aim 1. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline measures of clinical and radiologic severity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment nutritional status, antimicrobial serologies, and MRE findings will be associated with CH 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Formal hypothesis tests will be carried out to confirm the predictive power of a set of pre-specified measures using a logistic regression model. We will also conduct exploratory analyses of novel predictors, identified via machine learning methods, to assess their relationship with CH after adjusting for the confirmed primary predictors. Aim 2. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline host and microbial genomic and metabolic factors. We hypothesize that pre-treatment gene expression signatures and microbial factors will be associated with year 1 CH. We will characterize the host genotype, longitudinal microbial taxonomic and metabolomic profiles, and ileal and colon host epigenome and transcriptome at baseline and at 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Aim 3. Use a k-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal predictive model of year 1 CH. We hypothesize that a model which includes host gene signatures and microbes will improve prediction of CH beyond one based on clinical and imaging factors alone. The model will include significant clinical and imaging predictors from Aim 1 and the subset of baseline host and microbial characteristics found to be potentially explanatory in Aim 2. Impact. The proposed inception cohort study, CAMEO, will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to healing in pediatric CD that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed inception cohort study CAMEO will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to bowel healing in pediatric Crohn's disease that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches. Achieving higher rates of bowel healing will improve quality of life, mitigate need for surgery and hospitalizations, and potentially reduce long term healthcare expenditures.","Clinical, imaging, and endoscopic outcomes of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease",10292286,U34DK126638,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Budgets', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Management Resources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Hospitalization', 'IL17 Signaling Pathway', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intestines', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Taxonomy', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutritional status', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Ruminococcus', 'Sedimentation process', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'alpha-Defensins', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'clinical research site', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'healing', 'hospitalization rates', 'ileum', 'improved', 'infliximab', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'operation', 'operational taxonomic units', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'seropositive', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome']",NIDDK,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,U34,2021,391223
"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC. In so doing, we will identify molecular signatures including immune alterations, environmental toxins, and metabolism-related chemicals unique to PBC patients, thereby spurring improved understanding of PBC pathobiology and identification of novel druggable targets.",Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10095117,R01DK126691,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'effective therapy', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'quantum', 'response', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,628683
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,10128367,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'urban setting']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2021,436080
"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings.

"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells.

Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,R44GM140607,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,DIGITAL PROTEOMICS LLC,R44,2021,23935
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,10201436,K25AI140783,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K25,2021,107880
"Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes ABSTRACT Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory condition, occurs as a complication of infection and in severe cases may be associated with acute and life-threatening organ dysfunction. In the US alone, sepsis claims ~270,000 lives each year among ~1.7 million patients diagnosed annually, and globally, sepsis-related mortality is estimated to account for 20% of total deaths. Although improvements in the treatment protocol for sepsis and timely administration of antibiotics have reduced mortality rates, not a single drug for sepsis has ever been successfully brought to market, despite over 100 interventional trials, and it is treated today as 60 years ago: antibiotics and supportive care. Sepsis is unusual in that a great deal of the immune response is actually adaptive (beneficial) vs. disease-causing (maladaptive), so reversing the inflammatory response can cause the infection to go unchecked. We believe that a treatment should reverse the maladaptive (organ-damaging) components of the immune response, while keeping the adaptive (pathogen-fighting) components intact. We believe that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness immune sub-groups. In this project, we propose a precision medicine approach to subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes” using a companion diagnostic test, HostDx-Endotypes. We anticipate that classifying sepsis patients into such endotypes may allow us to identify improved treatment regimens, leading to the discovery of new targets or pathways for endotype-specific therapies and/or repurposing of available drugs. In Phase 1 work we already demonstrated proof-of-concept by identifying 3 sepsis endotypes (Inflammopathic, Adaptive, and Coagulopathic) and validated across multiple external data sets. We have shown that our HostDx Endotypes can stratify patients into novel, potentially treatable subgroups across 3 publications using several retrospective cohorts, and two prospective cohorts. We have also demonstrated the clinical utility of this paradigm with InSepTM, our robust classifier for acute infectious disease, based on our HostDx point of care test system platform. To bridge our proof-of-concept work to product development for HostDx-Endotypes, we will (Aim 1) employ rigorous machine learning algorithms and processes to finalize and lock an optimal classifier; (Aim 2) apply an innovative approach of drug repurposing to identify and rank-order endotype-specific drug candidates for clinical studies on sepsis treatment, and (Aim 3) translate the final mRNA panel to Inflammatix’s qLAMP cartridge and platform. At Phase II completion we will have produced the HostDx Endotypes research-ready cartridge, together with a list of repurposed drugs for intended clinical trials, and will be ready to enter the formal product development phase; we will have initiated the FDA pre-submission. Ultimately, the goal of this product will be to definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a significant public health crisis, but despite over 100 interventional drug trials, effective sepsis treatments have proven elusive; emerging data suggests that this may be related to immune sub-groups of sepsis, wherein some components provide beneficial responses, while others are disease-causing. Inflammatix believes that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness these immune sub- groups, and our proposed HostDx-Endotypes test offers a precision medicine approach that would subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes”. This point-of-care cartridge-based blood test will enable clinicians to make timely and precise determinations of sepsis endotype that would definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation.",Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes,10324978,R44GM142428,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Cell Line', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Venipunctures', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug action', 'drug candidate', 'drug repurposing', 'fighting', 'genetic signature', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'point of care', 'point of care testing', 'precision medicine', 'product development', 'rapid test', 'response', 'septic patients', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R44,2021,683888
"Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes Project Summary The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has brought to light that more efforts are needed to evaluate the pandemic potential of viruses that can spill over in human populations. To assess the pandemic potential of specific viruses, over the next five years my lab will ask if similar viruses caused epidemics not only during the recent documented past, but during the much longer time scale of human evolution. Viruses that caused epidemics in the past are indeed the most likely to cause epidemics again in the future, and hundreds of viral epidemics likely plagued human populations during their evolution. This work will fill gaps in knowledge on epidemics in ancestral human populations, and by doing so, will enable a better assessment of the viruses that represent a future pandemic threat.  To study ancient epidemics, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation driven by ancient viruses. Arms races with viruses have shaped the host immune system by driving a large number of adaptations. I recently showed that viruses left abundant signals of adaptation not only in immune genes, but across the entire human genome. The lab will examine signals of adaptation left by specific viruses in human genomes, to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient epidemics. To this aim, we will develop new statistical tools based on recent advances in machine learning and in the reconstruction of Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs). These new approaches with increased power to detect and date genomic adaptation will allow us to ask the following questions: 1) Which viruses drove ancient epidemics in human evolution? My lab will create deep learning tests with high power to detect complex genomic adaptation within the past ~200,000 years of human evolution. 2) When did specific viruses drive ancient epidemics? We will use ARGs and Approximate Bayesian Computation to date ancient epidemics, by dating the host adaptive events driven by specific viruses. 3) Which functional host genetic changes were selected during ancient epidemics, in which genes, and how do they influence genetic susceptibility to present viruses? We will investigate regulatory adaptation to viruses and the overall impact of virus-driven host adaptation on the genetic susceptibility of different human populations to specific present viruses, thereby providing virologists with strong candidate host genes for further inquiry.  My lab is uniquely suited to decipher ancient epidemics by linking host-pathogen interactions together with the latest developments in the population genomics of adaptation. Project narrative Arms races with viruses have shaped human genomic adaptation, not only in immune genes, but also across the entire human genome. Over the coming years, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient viral epidemics that plagued ancestral human populations. Because past viral threats are more likely to become threats again in the future, ancient epidemics will provide a better assessment of the viruses with the potential to cause future epidemics.",Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes,10274677,R35GM142677,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mutation', 'Population', 'Race', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'deep learning', 'lens', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R35,2021,377363
"Learning a molecular shape space for the adaptive immune system Project Summary  The adaptive immune system consists of highly diverse B- and T-cell receptors, which can recognize and neutralize a multitude of diverse pathogens. Immune recognition relies on molecular interactions between immune receptors and pathogens, which in turn is determined by the complementarity of their 3D structures and amino acid compositions, i.e., their shapes. Immune shape space has been previously introduced as an abstraction for such molecular recognition to explain how immune repertoires are organized to counter diverse pathogens. However, the relationships between immune receptor sequence, shape, and specificity are very difficult to quantify in practice. We propose to use recent advances in machine learning and the wealth of molecular data to infer an effective shape space, grounded in biophysics of protein interactions. The key is to find a representation of proteins in general, and of immune receptors, in particular, that reflects the relevant biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, function, and interaction with pathogens.  Representation learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that uses large amounts of data to infer a reduced representation. Since protein function is closely related to the 3D structure, we will develop novel machine learning methods that use atomic coordinates of a protein structure as input and, through transformations that respect the physical symmetries in the data, learn representations that reflect biophysical properties of proteins and protein-protein interactions. We believe a key innovation in our approach is the analysis of amino acid neighborhoods within 3D protein structures. The distribution of these neighborhoods will reveal how they differ at the surface, in the bulk, and at functionally important regions such as catalytic sites. The learned protein representation will enable us to characterize how specific compositions of amino acid neighborhoods are the building blocks of protein structure and protein function. We will transfer the representation of protein universe to immune receptors to learn the immune shape space. The leaned immune shape space will enable us to address how affinity and specificity are encoded by immune receptors in different cell types. We will study how the modular structure of immune receptors, with separate pathogen engaging and framework regions, enables receptors to diversify and target a multitude of pathogens, without compromising their stability. We will use the complementary aspect of shape recognition to predict the antigenic targets of the immune receptors, and through collaborations, we will experimentally validate our predictions.  Our approach opens a new path towards interpretable computational models of proteins and immune receptors that describe how biological properties and biological function emerge from protein subunits. Additionally, the inferred molecular representations can be used as a generative model, where desired properties, such as antigenic targets, are specified and new proteins can be generated. Project Narrative The adaptive immune system can mount a specific response against a multitude of pathogens, through molecular recognition grounded in complex biophysics of protein-protein interaction. The proposed project aims to develop data-driven approaches to characterize a representation of protein interactions in general, and of immune receptors, in particular. The learned representation reflects the relevant biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, and function, and can be used to predict immune recognition and to design novel immune receptors and antibodies against a desired target.",Learning a molecular shape space for the adaptive immune system,10275426,R35GM142795,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Framework Regions', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Property', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteins', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'molecular recognition', 'molecular shape', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'response', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,368978
"MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular functions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput. Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by harnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Immunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms of action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody immunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T cells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic and durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient responses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may be the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of cells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles of cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity in T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose the development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale data from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands of cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for the development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology development and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that the successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying multi-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products, and the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy. We propose to develop and validate a technology for the multi-scale profiling of cells at the single-cell level. We anticipate that this technology will fundamentally alter the characterization of immune cells in the context of immunotherapy and vaccines.",MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles,10275702,R01GM143243,"['Adoptive Cell Transfers', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomanufacturing', 'CD19 gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crosslinker', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Translocation', 'Oncology', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein translocation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Specificity', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antibody immunotherapy', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crosslink', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'engineered T cells', 'genotyped patients', 'imaging system', 'metabolic profile', 'morphometry', 'multiscale data', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'software systems', 'success', 'technology development', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,523272
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis",10189504,R01AI143453,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody-mediated protection', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asia', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cryptococcal Meningitis', 'Cryptococcosis', 'Cryptococcus', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Encapsulated', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glucans', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Meningitis', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morphology', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Solid', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'antigen test', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'beta-Glucans', 'differential expression', 'fungus', 'global health', 'glucuronoxylomannan', 'high risk', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immune reconstitution', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'insight', 'interest', 'laminaran', 'microbial', 'mind control', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'natural antibodies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'transplantation therapy', 'uptake', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,709959
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,10159730,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data', 'data complexity', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,689648
"Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state Abstract Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate (Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions. Once complete, the proposed work will provide not only a general tool for integrative analysis of multiomics data but also specific mechanistic insights for understanding the regulation of immune system functions. Narrative The immune cells are diverse and have different functions despite they all share the same genome.

"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,10224652,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serology', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'porcine model', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,10240457,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hi-C', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,1221095
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccination outcome', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875
"System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adaptive immune responses are governed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which determines the fates and activities of T cells (helper, effector, etc.). The TCR and its signaling partners integrate antigen-recognition signals and second signals, which carry information about the context in which antigen presentation is occurring. Second signals can be either stimulatory or inhibitory: stimulatory signals are essential for T cell activation, whereas inhibitory signals (also called checkpoints) are responsible for T cell exhaustion and antigen tolerance. Stimulatory second signals are generated by the innate arm of the immune system when, for example, signaling by Toll-like receptors induces expression of the B7-family ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. Expression of B7-1/B7-2 indicates that antigen presentation is occurring within the context of an ongoing innate immune response. B7-1 and B7-2 are recognized by CD28, a TCR coreceptor that potently enhances TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. Inhibitory second signals arise during the course of chronic stimulation of TCR signaling. They are important for limiting the collateral damage caused by an immune response and avoidance of autoimmunity, but they can also be deleterious. For example, tumor cells commonly express the B7-family ligands B7-H1 (PD-L1/CD274) and B7-DC (PD- L2/CD273), which are recognized by PD-1, a TCR coreceptor that inhibits TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. B7-H1/B7-DC expression conveys immune privilege to tumor cells. For these and other reasons, it is imperative that we improve our basic understanding of checkpoint signaling. Here, we propose to characterize the dynamics of PD-1-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat E6-1, HuT 78, and TALL-104 cells, CRISPR-engineered cells derived from these parental cell lines, and primary human CD8+ cells. We will apply quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain an unbiased, nearly comprehensive picture of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) site abundances with and without PD-1/CD28 coreceptor signaling in populations of T cells over time and across conditions. Concurrently, using fluorescence microscopy and engineered SH2 domain affinity reagents, we will characterize single-molecule patterns of multisite phosphorylation for TCR, CD28, and PD-1. We will also measure membrane-recruitment lifetimes for individual cytosolic signaling partners of these receptors. The resulting data will be used to drive the formulation and parameterization of a detailed mechanistic model for TCR signaling accounting for the effects of CD28 and PD-1 coactivation. Although PD-1 is viewed as a platform for recruitment of phosphatases that counteract activation signals from kinases, we will evaluate specific hypotheses about how PD-1 could potentially generate positive signals for T-cell activation. These hypotheses are motivated by the fact that the best characterized signaling partners of PD-1 are protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, which are known to promote cell activation in other contexts by, for example, mediating the dephosphorylation of inhibitory pTyr sites. Model predictions will be tested. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will characterize PD-1 immune checkpoint signaling dynamics in T cells by using quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, bioinformatics, and mechanistic mathematical modeling. A better basic understanding of PD-1 signaling, which plays an important role in avoidance of autoimmunity and escape of cancer cells and pathogens from immune surveillance, has the potential to motivate evaluation of new therapeutic strategies for diverse diseases.",System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells,10211871,R01AI153617,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B7-DC antigen', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD80 gene', 'CD86 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Formulation', 'Human', 'ITAM', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'NR0B2 gene', 'Oncology', 'PTPN11 gene', 'PTPN6 gene', 'Pattern', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protein Dephosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Tyrosine Phosphorylation', 'Validation', 'Western Blotting', 'ZAP-70 Gene', 'adaptive immune response', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'chronic infection', 'dectin 1', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'response', 'single molecule']",NIAID,"TRIAD NATIONAL SECURITY, LLC",R01,2021,784623
"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases.

"Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism Abstract B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by commensals microbial antigens. In order to prevent commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response against bacterial antigens. To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep process of B cell proliferation and selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either antibody secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Intestinal B cells are also exposed to dietary and microbial metabolites during their activation and differentiation, but how these environmental cues shape B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of individual B cell clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology. Several lines of evidence indicate that metabolic switches act as intrinsic regulators of germinal center B cell response. However, how B cells integrate metabolite sensing with germinal center and antibody response remains undefined to date. In this application we test the hypothesis that the oxysterol 25-HC, an oxidized form of cholesterol, directly controls germinal center B cell response through its interaction with the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2). SREBP2 is a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and its transcriptional activity in the intestinal germinal center B cells couples lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation in the intestine. We also hypothesize that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells which are located in the germinal center, produce 25-HC in response to dietary cholesterol and microbiome, therefore linking rapidly changing intestinal homeostasis to B cell fate. Accumulating evidence indicates that 25-HC controls SREBP2 processing, but the implication for this cross talk in B cells in the gut has not been investigated so far. Our aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that SREBP2 activity controls germinal center B cell transcriptional profile and B cell fate; and 2) To define the environmental and cellular cues that regulate 25-HC niche. The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between oxidized form of cholesterol, intestinal metabolism and adaptive immune system activation. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our understanding of how intestinal metabolism shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, these studies will provide a foundation for better understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and differentiation in immune cells. Narrative Intestinal humoral response occurs in an environment exposed to multiple metabolic stimuli, from both diet and commensal bacteria. We identified the transcription factor SREBP2 as a potential key regulator of germinal center response. Oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have been shown to control SREBP2 activation and transcription activity. This proposal aims to identify the mechanisms by which SREBP2 shapes germinal center B cell differentiation in antibody-secreting plasma cells and to map oxysterol niche and its extrinsic requirements. Thus, insight into the oxysterols-SREBP2 axis during germinal center B cell differentiation and into the cellular and environmental regulation of oxysterol production, will be generated from this proposal.",Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism,10299176,R01AI155727,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '25-hydroxycholesterol', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B Cell Proliferation', 'B cell differentiation', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacterial Antigens', 'Bile Acids', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clone Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Cholesterol', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Follicular Dendritic Cells', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Oxides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenocopy', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spleen', 'Sterols', 'Stimulus', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'cholesterol absorption', 'commensal bacteria', 'dietary', 'dietary manipulation', 'draining lymph node', 'expectation', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'lipid biosynthesis', 'lipid metabolism', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'novel', 'oxysterol binding protein', 'plasma cell differentiation', 'prevent', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,467227
"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. Understanding what stimulates these behaviors will help research scientists and physicians to make bone marrow transplants more successful at curing cancer.",Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes,10101252,R01HL155741,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Antitumor Response', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Donor Selection', 'Education', 'Failure', 'Gene Combinations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologist', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'NK cell receptor NKB1', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptide Leader Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Receptor Gene', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'dimorphism', 'disorder risk', 'graft vs host disease', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'leukemia', 'leukemia relapse', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'peptide B', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relapse prediction', 'response']",NHLBI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,650223
"Characterizing Shared Features of Innate Immune Cells across Neurodegenerative Diseases using Single Cell Expression and Chromatin Accessibility Data With few effective interventions available and over 10 million patients affected, neurodegenerative diseases are an area of intense basic science and clinical research. Inspired by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that have identified many risk variants linked to immune genes, neurobiologists are just beginning to understand the inflammatory basis for neurodegeneration. Across degenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS), computational techniques applied to single cell datasets are identifying the role of immune cells in driving pathological changes in the brain. For instance, recent single cell expression studies in AD have identified a novel type of Disease Associated Microglia (DAM) associated with the disease. Preliminary analysis I performed on single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients suffering from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) recapitulated this DAM phenotype in AMD- derived microglia. Furthermore, analysis revealed that AMD-derived astrocytes drive neovascularization, a pathologic hallmark of AMD, through the increased expression of VEGF. These findings imply that neurodegeneration and pathologic changes in AMD are driven by innate immune cells, and, further, that these innate immune cell functions may be similar across neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that innate immune cell function and regulation that drives pathology is shared across neurodegenerative conditions. To identify these shared features, I will design and apply novel computational algorithms to single cell datasets from multiple neurodegenerative diseases - AMD, AD and MS - to elucidate the role of innate immune cells across conditions. In aim 1, I will apply a coarse graining algorithm, Diffusion Condensation, that clusters cells at all levels of granularity to identify pathologic microglial and astrocyte subsets in single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients with AMD. I will further apply this technique to subset these innate immune cells in publicly available single cell expression datasets in MS and AD in order to identify gene modules shared among microglia and astrocytes across diseases. In aim 2, I will apply a multi-modal data alignment algorithm, Harmonic Alignment, that integrates single cell expression and chromatin accessibility data to produce a rich, joint expression and accessibility profile for every cell to identify epigenetic regulators of expression. When used to integrate datasets derived from AMD patients and controls, this algorithm will be able to identify chromatin regions and candidate transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes key to microglial and astrocytic dysfunction. By overlapping our knowledge of GWAS risk alleles from AMD, AD and MS, on top of predicted epigenetic regulators of innate immune cell dysfunction in a neurodegenerative context, I hope to be able to elucidate the effect of risk variants in inducing disease in a cell-type specific manner. These projects will help identify shared genomic and regulatory mechanisms in innate immune cells across neurodegenerative diseases and will help identify common pathways for future therapeutic development. In order to understand the inflammatory basis of neurodegenerative diseases, single cell expression and chromatin accessibility datasets need to be met with novel computational strategies. Our machine learning techniques will aim to understand the shared genomic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of microglia and astrocytes in different neurodegenerative contexts: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease and Age-related Macular Degeneration. This proposal will identify specific genomic and epigenomic targets unique to innate immune cells shared across diseases that can aid in the development of immune-modulating interventions.",Characterizing Shared Features of Innate Immune Cells across Neurodegenerative Diseases using Single Cell Expression and Chromatin Accessibility Data,10141940,F30AI157270,"['Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Induced Mutation', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical condensation', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'multimodal data', 'multiple datasets', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,30891
"The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome engineering Project Summary The human gut microbiome is associated with a range of diseases, and may positively or negatively affect the success of therapies. However, the causal directions between the human gut microbiome and host health are seldomly clear due to a lack of feasible controlled experiments in humans. High resolution, high frequency temporal data of paired microbiome and physiological measurement, and rich metadata of potential confounders, allow the application of causal inference frameworks. Such data can be mined for potential microbiome drivers of host health, especially if both the microbiome and host physiology are perturbed during the time courses. We have recently published a vast longitudinal microbiome set from cancer patients undergoing severe perturbation of their immune system. Concurrently, these patients experience dramatic shifts in their gut ecosystem. We here propose to unlock this data and build a discovery platform for microbiome causality, towards rational microbiome engineering. We will develop a new machine-learning technique that enables rapid exploration of our data through effective visualization and a web-based interface. We will develop a new method to identify gut microbial competitor species of common pathogens, which are systematically missed by existing approaches but are representing the most promising targets for microbiome engineering. Finally, we will elucidate the bidirectional interplay between human- targeted medications and the gut microbiome. For this, we will leverage our large data set of paired microbiome and host immune cell trajectories. This will validate recent in vitro results indicating that human-targeted medications may influence gut ecology using in situ data, and it will identify potential gut microbiome modulation of pharmacokinetics. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a platform for the discovery of causal health effects of the human gut microbiome. For this, it provides exploration tools and inference techniques that unlock the potential of a recently acquired, vast data set comprising >10,000 stool samples, >1.5 million medical records, and >400,000 blood measurements from cancer patients. This enables discovery of candidate microbes that affect pharmacokinetics of human-targeted drugs, and reveals natural competitor species to common pathogens, thus revealing targets for rational microbiome engineering, towards turning the human gut microbiome into a therapeutic target of the future.",The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome engineering,10295394,DP2AI164318,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Ruminococcus', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shotguns', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Tacrolimus', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visualization', 'commensal microbes', 'complex data', 'cost', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'in silico', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'stool sample', 'structured data', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'web based interface']",NIAID,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,DP2,2021,508500
"Spatial-Genomic Integrative Multi-Species Analysis of Lymph Node Metastasis PROJECT SUMMARY Metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer-associated deaths. Dissemination to and colonization of lymph nodes (LNs) precedes metastasis to distant sites in most solid tumors. Our Center in Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) addresses the central hypothesis that metastasis to distant sites requires systemic immune tolerance induced by early interactions between immune and malignant cells in the metastatic lymph nodes (LN). In Project 1, we have successfully uncovered mechanisms by which metastasis to LNs occurs and the effects of these metastases on the formation of distant metastases, through a murine model of melanoma and have been demonstrating similar phenomena in a murine model of HNSCC. For this cost extension, we will continue our work to evaluate the roles of additional immune subsets in the tolerance process in melanoma and HNSCC, and determine the roles of tumor clonal heterogeneity between primary tumors and LN metastases. In Project 2, we have successfully developed a novel multiplexed immunofluorescence in situ imaging platform, CODEX, to characterize tissue architecture and demonstrated the application of CODEX to fresh frozen and FFPE tissue samples of primary and murine samples of HNSCC and melanoma. For the cost extension, Project 2 aims to continue its work to achieve co-detection of RNA with protein antibodies in CODEX to study the chemokine and cytokine candidates identified in Projects 1 and 3. In Project 3, we developed an integrative single-cell analysis pipelines to study imaging and sequencing data generated in our center. Through this analysis we have identified potentially druggable chemokine ligand-receptor pairs related to lymph node metastasis and validated their functional significance in collaboration with the Project 1 team. Our completed work includes a novel machine learning cell type identification method “CELESTA” to facilitate new insights on spatial biology. For the cost extension, Project 3 aims to continue to apply our computational tools and analysis pipelines to investigate additional immune cell types and stroma cells to identify mediators of tissue architectures facilitating lymph node metastasis on HNSCC tissue samples. We will validate the consistency of the finding on an independent cohort of human HNSCC TMA (Core 3), which is annotated with survival outcomes and collaborate with Project 1 for functional studies. In addition, our Center proposes to continue our efforts in outreach and dissemination through virtual monthly seminars.

"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,10005144,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'PD-1 blockade', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'ipilimumab', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'phase I trial', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2021,2275599
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity PROJECT SUMMARY Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE An emerging paradigm in cancer immunology states that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA in cancer is a critical mechanism for engaging tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune and regulatory factors, and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets.

"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,10116320,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,339613
"Gene Expression Analysis of Dog Natural Killer Cells as Immunotherapy Target Project Summary Dogs are large, outbred animals that develop cancer spontaneously in the presence of an intact immune system and in the setting of shared environmental exposures with humans. Humans and dogs also share a paired evolutionary history which has led to greater similarities between canine and human genomes and microbiomes than between mouse and human. Together, these traits make dogs an advantageous translational model to study cancer immunology and cancer immunotherapy. Dog clinical trials allow for the study of complex immune interactions during therapy while also addressing long-term efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapies. However, immune dissection requires the development of robust and validated assays and reagents, and high impact studies using dog immunotherapy are premature until a deeper understanding of dog immunology and immune biomarkers is realized, especially for natural killer (NK) cells. This proposal will build on our exciting preliminary data characterizing dog NK cells, including first-in-dog clinical trials of adoptive transfer of dog NK cells and novel cytokine delivery with inhaled IL-15. In collaboration with the School of Medicine, the School of Veterinary Medicine, and the Data Intensive Biology Lab which performs cross-species genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic sequence analyses, we will examine dog NK differential gene expression across 1) multiple stimulatory and steady-state conditions; 2) from dog blood and tumor bio-specimens; and 3) from responding and non-responding dogs treated with inhaled IL-15 on an investigational dog clinical trial. We will utilize multiple applications of high-throughput sequencing technologies (RNASeq and single cell RNA sequencing) to establish more robust and validated gene signatures of resting and activated dog NK cells from both ex vivo and in vivo conditions with further analysis of dog sarcoma-infiltrating NK cells. We will then compare these gene signatures to data from high throughput sequencing of murine and human NK cells to bridge species differences and facilitate clinical translation. Ultimately, knowledge of the role of canine NK cells in immune defense and cancer therapy is limited, and it remains unclear whether this is due to biological differences across species or limited reagents for investigation. Results from this proposal will extend the important link that canine studies provide between murine pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials, for cancer immunotherapy research in general but especially for NK studies where high impact clinical translation has remained elusive. Project Narrative Dogs have emerged as an important link between murine models and human clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy research, as they are outbred companion animals that develop spontaneous tumors in the setting of an intact immune system. In this study, in order to advance the cross-species evaluation of natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy, we examine 1) canine, human, and murine NK differential gene expression across multiple activating conditions, 2) canine NK cells from dogs with spontaneous metastatic osteosarcoma receiving inhaled IL-15 on a clinical trial, and 3) canine NK cells from the tumors of dogs with osteosarcoma, using multiple applications of high-throughput sequencing technology to assess signatures of tumor-responsive NK cells. This proposal will fill an important gap in NK cell biology as important species differences exist between mouse and human NK cells and improved characterization of dog NK cells will help bridge pre-clinical mechanistic studies in mice to novel clinical trials in humans.",Gene Expression Analysis of Dog Natural Killer Cells as Immunotherapy Target,10201901,R03CA252793,"['Address', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inhalation', 'Interleukin-15', 'Investigation', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metagenomics', 'Metastatic Osteosarcoma', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'NK cell therapy', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Visual', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'companion animal', 'comparative', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxicity', 'differential expression', 'dog genome', 'exhaustion', 'genetic signature', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'osteosarcoma', 'overexpression', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'receptor', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'species difference', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2021,78500
"Mapping Single Extracellular Vesicles to Parent Cells for Immunotherapy Monitoring This proposal aims to develop an ultra-high sensitive platform that can map cell and extracellular vesicle (EV) molecular information at the single particle level, and apply it to proﬁle tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for immunotherapy monitoring. This technology can resolve heterogeneity of biological systems and has the potential to discover robust biomarkers that can accurately proﬁle status of the body for disease diagnostics. This proposal hypothesizes that single cell-single EV mapping will provide new molecular information on cell-cell communication for better understanding of pathological development and disease diagnosis. The goals of this proposal are threefold: i) development of single EV protein sequencing technology to resolve EV heterogeneity and discover rare EV subtypes for disease biomarkers, ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed live cell ﬂuorescence imaging to monitor the changes of cellular phenotypes and identify multiple immune cell types, and iii) single cell-single EV mapping to discover new molecular information on cell-cell communication through vesicle secretion. This technology will allow repeat sampling and monitoring of TIME during the course of immunotherapy and provide guidance to achieve the best possible patient outcomes. With the expertise in microﬂuidics, molecular biology, and machine learning, Jina Ko (the PI of this proposal) has developed new micro- and nano-technologies for liquid biopsy that can extract multidimensional molecular data from blood-based biomarkers (e.g. circulating tumor cells, EV). She has extended her expertise to chemistry, droplet microﬂuidics, and translational medicine to develop novel platforms that will serve as a fundamental work to this proposal. She has recently developed i) ultra-high sensitive single EV proﬁling technology using droplet digital PCR and ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed cellular ﬂuorescence imaging. Through this work, Jina has forged research collaborations within and outside the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School at the Wyss Institute and Harvard University. Building upon these achievements, this work will be executed with a team of world experts in droplet microﬂuidics and physics (Weitz), molecular imaging and diagnostics (Weissleder), immunology (Pittet), exosome biology and neurogenetics (Breakeﬁeld), and neurosurgery and oncology (Chiocca) who will provide a full support on this work. Working with these mentors will allow her to tackle clinically challenging problems and further develop her career as an independent investigator with the ability to develop next generation medical diagnostics. The aim of this proposal is to develop an ultra-high sensitive single cell-single extracellular vesicle (EV) mapping technology that can resolve both cell and EV heterogeneity.

"Mechanisms of Lysosome Mediated Immune Evasion in Pancreatic Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a malignancy refractory to most therapies including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, utilizes diverse mechanisms to evade immune clearance. One mechanism involves reduced presentation of tumor specific antigens by Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) to immune cells. Many cancers alter MHC-I expression via genetic or epigenetic silencing, however changes in MHC-I trafficking can also profoundly influence antigen presentation at the cell surface and is a previously underappreciated mechanism of MHC-I regulation in cancer. My preliminary data uncovers a role for enhanced autophagy/lysosome function in immune evasion through selective targeting of MHC-I molecules for degradation. PDA cells display reduced MHC-I cell surface expression and instead, demonstrate predominant localization within autophagosomes and lysosomes. Notably, autophagy inhibition restores surface MHC-I levels, leading to improved antigen presentation, enhanced anti-tumor T cell response, and reduced tumor growth in syngeneic hosts. Accordingly, autophagy inhibition, either genetically or pharmacologically with Chloroquine (CQ), synergizes with dual ICB (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4), and leads to an enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Motivated by this preliminary data, my specific aims will address two fundamental questions underlying the basic biology of MHC-I regulation and altered trafficking to the lysosome in PDA: (1) What are the distinct molecular mechanisms governing MHC-I capture by the autophagy machinery? and (2) Where does capture of MHC-I occur in the cell prior to trafficking to the lysosome for degradation? Results from these studies will lead to a detailed molecular understanding of the underlying properties of PDA cells and potentially other aggressive cancers, that lead to reduced MHC-I mediated antigen presentation. Project Narrative The development and use of immunotherapy-based strategies that activate the immune system to search and destroy cancer cells has revolutionized cancer therapy for many patients. However, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a malignancy refractory to most therapies including immune checkpoint blockade, remains one of the most difficult diseases to treat. Thus, we will define the underlying molecular mechanisms governing defective antigen presentation to identify combination therapy strategies that could be effective in PDA.",Mechanisms of Lysosome Mediated Immune Evasion in Pancreatic Cancer,10142273,F31CA257377,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antitumor Response', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Autophagosome', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chloroquine', 'Chronic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Destinations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lysosomes', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Organelles', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmacology', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Route', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cytotoxic', 'epigenetic silencing', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune clearance', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibition of autophagy', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'neoplastic cell', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'residence', 'text searching', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'ubiquitin-protein ligase']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2021,41421
"Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma. PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop a pathomics biosignature for aggressive melanoma to guide treatment decisions for patients who have had a melanoma surgically removed but remain at high risk of recurrence and death. This is a critical need because patients with stage II and III melanoma have an approximate 30% chance of dying of melanoma over 10 years. Therapies have been shown to lessen recurrence risk, but they are toxic and costly. Identifying patients who have truly been cured by the surgery and are cancer free would be tremendously useful to guide patient care. It has been known for decades that the immune system limits melanoma progression and that higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) portend a favorable outcome. Assessment of TILs, however, involves a subjective determination by the pathologist using qualitative criteria and this approach is prone to inter-observer variability. One barrier to the development of prognostic biomarkers in early stage melanoma is that the tumors are tiny and most dermato-pathologists require that the entire sample be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) for careful morphology analysis. In order to overcome this barrier, our team has developed and published three digital pathology methods to estimate recurrence risk. These biomarkers are based on the hypothesis that evidence of strong immune surveillance within the tissue indicates lower recurrence risk and include quantitation of TILs using digital software, staining for macrophages and T cells using quantitative- immune-fluorescence (qIF), and measurement of an interferon signature using NanoString technology. Each of these methods provides unique information about the tumor immune micro-environment. For example, NanoString provides genomic information but does not provide spatial information regarding the locations of specific cell phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as qIF does. For instance, qIF revealed the macrophages confer a poor prognosis specifically when located within the tumor stroma. In Aim 1 of the proposal we validate three previously published biomarkers using 514 melanoma samples from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, The University of British Columbia, Yale School of Medicine, and Geisinger Health Systems. Next, in Aim 2 of the proposal we propose an integrative systems biology approach including transcriptomic, qIF, morphology analysis of TILS, and standard clinical and pathology features to create a multi-parameter biosignature. First, we use the raw clinical and pathomics data to build a model multiscale biomarker network of aggressive skin melanoma. Using a Bayesian network, we identify nodes that determine the recurrence phenotype and identify new imaging and genomic targets that may enhance the precision of our biomarker. We then construct a composite biosignature based on this network. Finally, we test the new biosignature, as well as the original multiply validated biomarkers from Aim 1 in prospective retrospective fashion on samples from the E1697 trial of adjuvant interferon for which there is over 10 years of follow up. The retrospective prospective approach removes any selection bias introduced by retrospective study. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to identify patients with stage II-III melanoma who have been cured by surgery, are not likely to recur, and should not receive further treatment. The immune system limits cancer progression but to date no biomarkers are available to define low risk groups. We further validate previously developed immune biomarkers and combine them to create a composite biosignature defining patients who can safely be spared the expense and toxicity of therapy.",Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma.,10214049,R01CA260375,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'British Columbia', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Skin', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Update', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nano-string', 'network models', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,693456
"PRIMAVO: Interactive exploration of cancer patient precision immune monitoring data in clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapies have dramatically changed clinical practice following the approval of more than a dozen new drugs and/or indications in the past few years1–4. However, only a minority of patients derives clinical benefit, while some develop off-target effects. To identify novel biomarkers of disease course and response, as well as potential off-target responses to immunotherapy in cancer patients, the NCI’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative (CMI) is supporting a growing number of cancer immunotherapy trials. Our team is at the forefront of the CMI efforts with two grants: 1) a U24 on high-dimensional immune monitoring of NCI-supported immunotherapy trials as part of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); and 2) a U01 on characterizing and predicting a toxic side-effect of immunotherapy, colitis, in immune checkpoint blockade- treated cancer patients, as part of the Immuno-Oncology Translational Network (IOTN). However, with the rapid development of new and improved technologies, these studies produce diverse data types of ever- expanding size and complexity. Visualizing, exploring, and communicating results from the computational analysis of these disparate high-dimensional immune monitoring assays is imperative but challenging, especially because many visualization tools are either built only for in-house utilization or typically specialize in only one or perhaps a few data types. At the same time, cross-assay or cross-participant data interpretation is the only way to identify relevant immune biomarkers that impact clinical trial design and clinical cancer care. There is thus an unmet need for easy-to-use interactive tools for integrative exploration of cancer patient immune monitoring data by biologists and clinicians. This proposal aims to address this need through the development of a user-friendly, integrative web-based visualization tool, Precision Immunology Monitoring Analysis and Visualization Online (PRIMAVO), that will enable researchers of all computational skill levels to visually analyze and interactively explore immune monitoring assay results that belong to a cancer immunotherapy trial, at multiple levels of granularity. The PRIMAVO tool will scale with current and future data growth and complexity to enable fast and effective research towards identifying associations between different data types, participants, and clinical variables. We hypothesize that developing (i) cohort-level; and (ii) participant-level visualizations that integrate views across multiple immune data types, participants, cohorts and time points will provide a deep, comprehensive view of events; and that (iii) the content and features of PRIMAVO will be greatly enhanced by engaging with the user community during its development. The results from this highly integrated effort will have important clinical and public health implications by accelerating our understanding of the immune responses of cancer patients to immunotherapies and significantly impact the rate at which immune biomarkers from clinical trials will be identified, interpreted, verified and translated into clinically actionable findings. Overall, PRIMAVO will be a highly valuable tool for the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NCI’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative (CMI) is supporting a growing number of immunotherapy clinical trials to identify clinically actionable biomarkers of antitumor activity and potential off-target toxicity. This proposal aims to develop a user-friendly, unified web-based tool that enables researchers of all computational skill levels to visually analyze and interactively explore ever-expanding high-dimensional immune monitoring assay results from CMI cancer immunotherapy trials at multiple levels of granularity.

"Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY  The adaptive immune system is responsible for the specific recognition and elimination of antigens originating from infection and disease. It recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies (B-cell receptors, BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs), the immune repertoire. Because of the enormous breadth of epitopes recognized by immune repertoires, immune repertoires are extremely diverse and dynamic. Advances in immune receptor sequencing (Rep-seq), such as next generation sequencing, have driven the quantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence landscape. However, current analysis tools lack the ability to track and examine the dynamic nature of the repertoire across serial time points or to identify the common features across repertoires thoroughly and efficiently. We will develop computationally efficient methods with advanced machine learning techniques, including network analysis, feature selection and classification, and advanced statistical approaches, to interrogate and measure immune repertoire architecture longitudinally, to identify common features across repertoires and to assess their clinical relevance. Network analysis is a powerful approach that can identify TCRs sharing antigen specificity and highly mutable BCR, which can help to develop or improve existing immunotherapeutics and immunodiagnostics. However, network construction is computationally expensive, therefore, we will develop an adaptive subsampling strategy to relieve computation burden. We will implement the proposed methods on two studies to better illustrate the diversity and richness of the data to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the proposed tools. Furthermore, we will develop bioinformatics software by incorporating the proposed methods and techniques to tackle the complexity of the Rep-seq data in a translational fashion and provide a comprehensive platform with user-friendly visualization tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE T cells and B cells as the crucial components of the adaptive immune system. Next generation sequencing of the T and B cell receptors can be used to profile the T and B cell repertoire (Rep-seq). We hypothesize that understanding the network architecture of immune repertoire will reveal the role of adaptive immune response to cancer immunotherapy. We propose to apply network analysis with advanced statistical approaches and computational techniques on Rep-seq data to unravel how the adaptive immune system is altered by immunotherapy within clinical responders and non-responders.",Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy,10305538,R21CA264381,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Future', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunodiagnostics', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'adaptive immune response', 'analysis pipeline', 'antigen antibody binding', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'computational pipelines', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'network architecture', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'performance tests', 'prognostic', 'receptor', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,201324
