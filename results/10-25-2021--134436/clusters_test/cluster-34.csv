"Smartphone-based mindfulness training for health following early life adversity PROJECT SUMMARY Over 25% of the US population reports exposure to early life adversity (ELA)—physical or emotional trauma or neglect in childhood. ELA predicts life-long health disparities, including increased risk for chronic cardiometabolic and autoimmune diseases and early mortality. Exposure to adversity in childhood is thought to program biological adaptations to stress that contribute to disease risk in adulthood. There are currently no evidence-based interventions to offset these risks in adulthood. Mindfulness meditation interventions have been effective for reducing stress and improving markers of physical health. However, it is unclear whether mindfulness interventions are acceptable and effective for improving health among people with a history of ELA. In a sample of emerging and young adults with a history of ELA, the proposed study evaluates feasibility of using smartphone-based mindfulness and control interventions and of measuring stress in daily life using ambulatory assessment and mobile sensor models with the long-term goal of implementing a stress-triggered just-in-time (JIT) mindfulness intervention in future research. Emerging/young adults with a history of ELA (n=80) will provide two weeks of baseline ambulatory stress ratings, continuous mobile sensor data (e.g., heart rate, activity, and location from wearable devices and smartphones), and blood samples to assess inflammatory biomarkers. Participants will then be randomly assigned to a 14-lesson smartphone-based (a) mindfulness training intervention or (b) matched coping control intervention, both boosted with randomly-delivered practice prompts to permit retrospective evaluation of JIT prompts. Ambulatory stress, sensor data, and inflammatory biomarkers will again be assessed at post-intervention and one-month follow-up. The following primary hypotheses will be tested: (1) interventions and assessments will be feasible in an ELA sample and (2) mindfulness training will improve daily life stress and inflammatory processes. Additionally, toward the design of a JIT mindfulness intervention, mobile sensor data will be used to develop machine-learning models predicting daily life stress, and practice prompts delivered at high stress moments will be evaluated for stress reduction benefit. To meet these aims, the candidate has assembled a mentorship team and training plan focused on (1) conceptual and methodological issues in ELA and health disparities, (2) advanced methods for assessing ambulatory and biological outcomes, and (3) new technology for optimizing outcome assessment and intervention delivery. Combined with the candidate’s background in mechanistic mindfulness research, the proposed research and training will launch an independent career dedicated to maximizing the efficacy of mindfulness interventions for addressing health disparities. These goals align with NCCIH’s objectives to advance understanding of complementary health interventions for improving health in at-risk populations using novel assessment technologies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life adversity—reported by over 25% of the US population—is thought to program biological adaptations to stress that contribute to life-long health disparities, including increased risk for chronic disease and early mortality. Interventions to offset these risks in adulthood are needed; mindfulness meditation interventions have been effective for reducing stress and improving markers of physical health, but whether they are acceptable and effective for improving health among people with a history of ELA remains unclear. From a public health perspective, establishing an evidence base for remote, just-in-time mindfulness interventions may help to address health disparities in a wide population.",Smartphone-based mindfulness training for health following early life adversity,10301480,K01AT011232,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Adaptation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'Buffers', 'Cardiometabolic Disease', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary Health', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Educational Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'IL8 gene', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Process', 'Psychological Tests', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'TNF gene', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Youth', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'active control', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'career development', 'coping', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early life adversity', 'emerging adult', 'emotional neglect', 'emotional trauma', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'health training', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'stress reactivity', 'stress reduction', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,131085
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggest that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcription in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections.

"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,10229520,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'preventive intervention', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'porcine model', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,790095
"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,10145795,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker signature', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,764882
"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diet Habits', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'REM Sleep', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sucrose', 'Suggestion', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'circadian', 'cohesion', 'data structure', 'digital', 'field study', 'forced swim test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stressor', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects Project Summary We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects (CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear stress to gene expression.  This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.  Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more effectively. Project Narrative Abnormal blood flow has been shown to play a role in the formation of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, few tools exist to study how forces exerted by blood flow early in heart development result in altered molecular signaling. Our proposal centers on creating optical imaging to investigate mechanical stresses experienced by cells lining the beating, early-stage heart tube and how these cells and adjacent tissues respond in gene expression in each area of the heart during normal, diseased, and rescued conditions.",Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects,10211096,R01HL126747,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Betaine', 'Biological Process', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Heart', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Heart', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quail', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sequencing By Hybridizations', 'Shprintzen syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tube', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'indexing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,767418
"The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) encompasses a spectrum ranging from aggressive autoimmunity toward islet β cells to defects in β-cell function that arise from inflammation. A perspective that has been gaining traction in recent years posits that intracellular signaling pathways arising from the β cell response to inflammation can lead to the production of aberrant proteins that serve as neoantigens that initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity. This perspective has prompted our Team to identify and intervene in intracellular signaling pathways that affect β-cell resilience as T1D progresses from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stages. This proposal takes a multidisciplinary Team Science approach that is responsive to RFA-DK-19-024 to define and intervene in early T1D disease processes affecting human islets. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals are transduced intracellularly to activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an effort to redirect energy expenditure to mitigate the prevailing stress. The translationally inhibited mRNAs and their associated proteins are sequestered into intracellular stress granules (SGs), the formations of which are thought to divert cellular signaling toward an emergency response. Our preliminary data suggest that the ISR is activated in islets during early T1D, and that the pathway linking membrane-derived lipids to the production of proinflammatory lipid intermediates may trigger the ISR and the formation of SGs. We hypothesize that the activation of the ISR and formation of SGs is an early cellular response initiating β cell stress in T1D that determines cell survival and can be monitored in pre- and early T1D individuals with minimal invasiveness. Our collaborative Team will test this hypothesis through the following aims:  Aim 1: Define the mechanisms of stress granule formation and their fate upon activation of the integrated stress response in human islets.  Aim 2: Determine the molecular events linking lipid metabolism, activation of the ISR, and stress granule formation in human islets.  Aim 3: Identify protein, RNA, and lipid cargo in EVs as putative biomarkers of the human islet integrated stress response and T1D risk.  This application leverages the expertise of 6 Multi-PIs in β-cell biology, lipid and eicosanoid biology, functional genomics, proteomics, computational modeling, and clinical islet studies. The impact of this project will be to deliver new knowledge on an unstudied stress pathway in human islets and to identify and validate biomarker panels that reflect this stress state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that results from dysfunction and death of islet β cells. The identification and characterization of new pathways promoting stress in β cells would allow for the institution of defined therapies that protect β cells and their function.

"Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy Abstract  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of systolic heart failure with poor prognosis and no specific treatment to address the underlying contractile deficit. In addition to the loss of contractility, there is also impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship, an adaptive process that is described as the increase in contractile force in response to increased preload. We are proposing to investigate a novel therapy for DCM that addresses both loss of contractility and impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship. This novel therapy is achieved by increasing intracellular levels of 2-deoxy ATP (dATP) in cardiomyocytes via increasing the expression of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (R1R2), the rate-limiting step in de novo dNTP biosynthesis. Increased intracellular levels dATP in cardiomyocytes increases contraction by enhancing cross-bridge binding and cycling kinetics and improving allosteric activation of contraction. Recent data suggests that in addition to improved contraction, increased dATP level also enhances the Frank Starling relationship. I will propose specific aims to assess the effect of increased dATP on the Frank Starling relationship and contraction in two animal models of DCM. In the first aim, I will use a genetic model of DCM with a D230N mutation in alpha-tropomyosin (D230N Tm). Using recombinant D230N Tm, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation reduces thin filament activation and, as a consequence, the kinetics of contractile activation and relaxation. I will then determine the effect of increasing dATP content on these deficits. Using tissue from transgenic D230N Tm mice, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation decreases calcium sensitivity of force and length-dependent activation. I will correct these functional deficits by increasing dATP content. Using AAV6-cR1R2, an adeno-associated viral vector that restricts R1R2 over-expression to cardiac myocytes, I will test the hypothesis that increasing dATP levels improves contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes, and improves systolic function in both adult and young D230N Tm mice. Similarly, I will use post-infarct model of DCM in rats to evaluate the effect of cross-bridge activation on length dependent activation (LDA)-the Frank Starling relationship at the sarcomere level. Next, I will use alternative agents to increase (dextran, EMD 50733) or decrease (BDM, beryllium fluoride, high inorganic phosphate) cross-bridge recruitment and evaluate their effect on LDA in demembranated post- infarct DCM rat trabecula. I will complete this aim by testing the hypothesis that cross-bridge activation augments LDA in human myocardium from patients with DCM. Extension Project: Use data from above studies in D230N Tm DCM rodent model to simulate realistic cardiac twitches and use machine-learning methods for parameter optimization. Heart failure, the inability for the heart to keep up with its work load, is a growing epidemic in worldwide, with high mortality despite current available medical treatments. In the most common form, the heart is dilated with reduced contractile function. We are proposing a novel mechanism to treat this problem by altering the fuel used for contraction employing the naturally occurring molecule, deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).",Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy,10391887,K08HL128826,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anabolism', 'Animal Model', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Data', 'Deoxyadenosines', 'Dextrans', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemic', 'Fluorides', 'Genetic Models', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Myocardium', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Relaxation', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase', 'Rodent Model', 'Sarcomeres', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Thin Filament', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Workload', 'adeno-associated viral vector', 'alpha Tropomyosin', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'recruit', 'response', 'tripolyphosphate']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K08,2021,44640
"Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Trauma is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-trauma risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. Moreover, urban racial/ethnic minorities can experience significant environmental stress that puts them at particularly high risk for PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of risk specific to urban racial minorities, or that takes into account how disadvantage and minority stress may impact neurobiological stress systems in the months following trauma, and how that affects risk for long-term distress. Thus, under the guidance of a community advisory board our team will 1) identify acute post-trauma neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD among urban Black Americans, with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat, 2) characterize how the longitudinal interaction of socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors and biological stress markers following trauma impacts risk, and 3) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of neuroimaging, biomarkers, self-report and geocoded risk and resilience variables. We will recruit 190 adults who identify as Black or African American from the Emergency Department at Froedtert Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months following trauma exposure. The two-week and 12-month assessments will include measures of neural systems for threat processing, including both anticipation of and reactivity to threat. All visits will include measures of PTSD and other symptoms, neurobiological stress markers, particularly endocannabinoids, and socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors, especially those relevant for urban Black Americans. We will examine how acute post-trauma neurocircuitry variables (2 week) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later, and how pre-trauma environmental variables (resource deprivation, child maltreatment, violence exposure) moderate this relationship (Aim 1). We will also assess how, in the months following trauma, socio-environmental risk and resilience factors influence neurobiological stress systems, and how this interaction impacts risk for PTSD, poor physical health, and emotion regulation neurocircuitry at twelve months (Aim 2). We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified predictors (Aims 1 and 2), as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses (Aim 3). This approach will allow for determination of the additional utility of neurobiological markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of PTSD following trauma for urban Black Americans at high risk that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant neurobiological stress response) that can inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban Black American trauma survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying factors that contribute to risk or resilience for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem, particularly for urban racial minorities who are at high risk and experience significant chronic socioenvironmental stress. This work seeks to identify whether dysregulation in emotion regulation neural circuitry two weeks following trauma predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later among urban Black adults. Moreover, we will examine how environmental risk (e.g., discrimination) and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood cohesino) in the months following trauma impact neurobiological stress systems and how this interplay impacts neural health and risk for chronic distress. These data will advance our understanding of both socioenvironmental and neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of trauma.",Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors,10379585,R01MH128982,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Amines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'brain health', 'cytokine', 'deprivation', 'emotion regulation', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'pediatric trauma', 'physical conditioning', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'preventive intervention', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'risk prediction', 'socioenvironmental factor', 'stress management', 'stressor', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,791975
"Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light- Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress- mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['4D Imaging', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Arteries', 'Bicuspid', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Coupled', 'Cuspid', 'Custom', 'Data Reporting', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Microscopy', 'Mitral Valve', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Neuregulin 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'erbB-2 Receptor', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'mechanotransduction', 'multidisciplinary', 'notch protein', 'optical imaging', 'response', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",10197158,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'environmental stressor', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,319720
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate quiescence.",Systems biology of quiescence entry,10115766,K99GM135487,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Core Facility', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nitrogen', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Nutrient Depletion', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcription Repressor', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'anaphase-promoting complex', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gene repression', 'genetic approach', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'yeast genetics']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,95866
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. As an application of this platform, we propose to measure the forces stem- cell derived cardiomyocytes which bear genetically encoded contractile dysfunction for drug screening.",Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets,10158533,R21GM137151,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boron', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Individual', 'Island', 'Kinetics', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Myopathy', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relaxation', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'analog', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cellular engineering', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'detection limit', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'metallicity', 'nano', 'nanofabrication', 'response', 'sensor', 'stem cells', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,182532
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,10080366,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2021,161047
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,10136697,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172800
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,10114147,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survival disparity', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,526607
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,920184
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations.

Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,10225342,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,135053
"Tricuspid valve adaptation to right heart disease: A multiscale, histomechanical study in sheep PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 1.6 million Americans suffer from leakage of their right atrioventricular heart valve, which is referred to as tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation (TR). This is noteworthy as TR is not only a significant source of morbidity but also an independent predictor of mortality. Furthermore, treatment options for severe TR are suboptimal, with as many as 30% of patients developing recurrent TR within five years of surgery. TR is in most cases considered secondary to other conditions, implying that its causes are valve-extrinsic. Specifically, it is thought that right ventricular remodeling due to pulmonary hypertension, for example, causes papillary muscle (PM) displacement and annular dilation. PM displacement subsequently radially strains and immobilizes the TV leaflets via chordal tethering, while TV annular dilation circumferentially strains the leaflets. Together, PM displacement and annular dilation prohibit proper coaptation, rendering the TV regurgitant. Interestingly, studies on the left side of the heart have shown that mitral valve (MV) tissue grows and remodels in response to pathological mechanical (patho-mechanical) stimuli from left ventricular (LV) disease, e.g., due to leaflet strains following PM displacement and annular dilation. Although at first believed to be a positive adaptation to a changing mechanical environment, this maladaptation also causes the MV leaflets to thicken and become stiffer, further compromising valve function. The TV, on the other hand, is severely understudied. Therefore, it is unknown whether the TV similarly remodels in response to patho-mechanical stimuli, and if remodeling contributes to improper valve function. This finding would render TR not entirely valve-extrinisic and thus call into question current treatment strategies as well as potentially explain poor outcomes. To fill this gap in our knowledge, the proposed project aims to demonstrate TV remodeling in vivo in response to leaflet strain in an ovine disease model at the micro-scale (Aim 1) and the tissue-scale (Aim 2). The aims utilize state-of-the-art techniques in morphometric analysis, microstructural imaging, mechanical testing, and quantitative protein analysis and are based on a well-established tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy sheep model. Our current lack of knowledge is potentially withholding better treatment strategies for TR, which could otherwise improve the currently poor outcomes of TV therapy. Thus, my ultimate goal is to inspire pharmacological strategies to modify the underlying biological events that lead to TV remodeling and optimize the tissue’s response to patho- mechanical stimuli. Such efforts are underway for the MV where Losartan is tested as a pharmacological treatment of MV regurgitation. Along with the research strategy, the fellowship training plan is organized to offer the applicant professional development toward an independent research career in a top tier institutional environment at the University of Texas at Austin under the sponsorship of leading experts in heart valve tissue biomechanics. Upon completion of the training program, the applicant will be ideally-prepared for further postdoctoral training and eventually a faculty position in cardiovascular disease research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The backflow of blood through the tricuspid valve (TV), or tricuspid regurgitation (TR), presents to some degree in up to 85% of the population, while severe TR strongly predicts worsened prognoses and increases patient mortality. Furthermore, treatment options for severe TR are suboptimal, with as many as 30% of patients redeveloping tricuspid leakage within five years of surgery. The proposed project tests how TV leaflet tissue adapts or maladapts to heart disease conditions which can inform more optimal treatments for leaking tricuspid valves, improving societal health.","Tricuspid valve adaptation to right heart disease: A multiscale, histomechanical study in sheep",10249361,F31HL145976,"['Address', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extravasation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Valves', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Losartan', 'Mechanics', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phototherapy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases', 'Side', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'Tricuspid valve structure', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'career', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'interstitial cell', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'papillary muscle', 'post-doctoral training', 'repaired', 'response', 'sheep model', 'treatment strategy', 'two photon microscopy']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F31,2021,37764
"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients. These studies hold potential for helping us understand and identify those patients at greatest risk of HRCP and subsequent heart attacks and death, and to evaluate the biological reasons that these patients develop HRCP.",Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque,10219348,R01HL146145,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'coronary plaque', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'neglect', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1279576
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,10183311,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,649707
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Prognosis', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'risk prediction']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584
"The Functional Connectome of the Mechanically Loaded Cardiomyocyte Mechanical load on the heart profoundly affects cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling that governs heart function. Recent experimental studies have revealed that mechanotransduction mechanisms link to multiple signaling pathways to modulate the activities of many ion channels, Ca2+ handling molecules, and contractile proteins, which work in concert to regulate contractile force to compensate for external load changes. Such autoregulation of contractility requires highly coordinated modulation of many molecules by mechanotransduction. PROBLEM: Current mathematical modeling of cardiomyocytes often uses one-at-a- time parameter changes in model simulations. To understand how multiple parameters and molecules change in a coordinated pattern, however, will require a new mathematical strategy. One-at-a-time parameter changes cannot address how multiple parameters change in a coordinated way. Studying the coordinated changes requires simultaneously changing many model parameters but even this does not, by itself, reveal how the changes are coordinated. INNOVATION: We will develop a new Functional Connectome approach by the following strategy. (a) Randomly change parameters of many subsystems. Because we make few a priori assumptions on what subsystems might be involved, this approach can reduce exclusion of some subsystems, which is important because cellular processes are highly interconnected. (b) From many simulated parameter combinations, we use experimental data to filter out a small number of subsets that fit all the data. Such a subset is called an Acceptable Parameter Set (APS). (c) To determine the coordinated changes of subsystems, we use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD factorization of the parameter matrix shows that the APS often lies in a low-dimensional subspace of the entire high-dimension parameter space. The linear structure of this subspace gives both the map of connected subsystems and how the subsystems are modulated coordinately to produce the functional output. We call this connection map the Functional Connectome. Our interdisciplinary team will combine mathematical modeling with state-of-the-art experiments to achieve three specific aims: (1) Extend the cardiomyocyte mathematical model to include mechano-chemo-transduction feedback loop for studying autoregulation of Ca2+ and contractility in response to mechanical load changes. (2) Develop the Functional Connectome modeling platform to find patterns in myriad molecular changes. (3) Experimental test of the Functional Connectome predictions in mechanically loaded cardiomyocytes. SIGNIFICANCE: The outcome of this project will provide a new mathematical platform for studying coordinated changes in biological cells, which enables finding patterns in myriad molecular changes by various stimuli, and piece together many data to form a big picture. We will apply the Functional Connectome to study how mechanical load on cardiomyocyte causes coordinated molecular changes that give rise to the autoregulation of contractility in the heart. 1 NARRATIVE The questions we address in this proposal are both simple and fundamentally important: How are multiple cellular processes coordinated to produce the whole-cell response to an external stimulus? To answer this question, we will develop a new mathematical analyses platform called the Functional Connectome in this project. As a specific case study, we will use the Functional Connectome analyses to study how mechanical load caused coordinated changes in multiple Ca2+ handling molecules to autoregulate muscle contraction in the heart.",The Functional Connectome of the Mechanically Loaded Cardiomyocyte,10065520,R01HL149431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exclusion', 'Feedback', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Production', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Running', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'connectome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'high dimensionality', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical load', 'mechanotransduction', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'shear stress', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,670458
"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts.

"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'EFRAC', 'Environment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'repaired', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'vector']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,169351
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Mitochondrial health, cardiovascular risk, and blood pressure targets in hypertensive adults PROJECT SUMMARY The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP) targets significantly reduced risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, leading to new guidelines recommending a lower BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. However, intensive BP targets may increase the risk of adverse events from antihypertensive therapy. With widespread adoption of the new BP guidelines, there is an urgent need to evaluate whether there are subgroups of patients who may have an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms from intensive BP lowering. We propose an innovative approach to risk stratification that integrates traditional risk factors with novel information gleaned from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that are essential for energy metabolism and stress adaptation. In animal models, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a fundamental role in aging, CVD, and neurodegenerative diseases. Because mitochondrial metabolism is vital to adapt positively to bioenergetic stressors such as BP lowering, measures of mitochondrial health may help to predict beneficial and adverse outcomes among adults undergoing intensive treatment for hypertension. Recent observational studies have linked novel mtDNA measures with several age-related outcomes, including risks of CVD, hypertension, death, dementia, and reduced functional status. However, the optimal methods for integrating data across the mitochondrial genome have not been established, nor have prior studies investigated the utility of mtDNA measures for identification of subgroups who may derive greatest benefits or harms from intensive BP targets. This proposal will leverage next-gen sequencing technology and machine learning analytics to develop and validate mtDNA risk scores that predict CVD risk, mortality risk, and longitudinal changes in cognitive and physical function in older adults. Our first Aim will implement a biologically-informed neural network among participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC; N=3,075) and the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Study (LIFE; N=1,755) to develop two mtDNA risk scores for prediction of CVD and cognitive and physical function outcomes, while accounting for the competing risk of death. Our second and third Aims will validate these mtDNA risk scores in two landmark trials that evaluated the impact of intensive vs standard BP targets on cardiovascular outcomes: SPRINT (N=9,361) and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD; N=2,488). We will then examine whether mitochondrial risk, assessed by these mtDNA scores, modifies the efficacy or safety of the BP interventions. This work will: 1) develop innovative methods for analysis of mitochondrial genomic data; 2) provide novel hypotheses regarding pathways linking mitochondrial health, CVD risk and functional status; and 3) explore the potential of mtDNA measures for personalized health interventions in older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies found that treating high blood pressure to a lower target reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death, but the benefits and risks of lower blood pressure targets may differ from person to person. These projects will explore whether the health of mitochondria, the structures that convert energy into a form the body can use, affects the benefits or risks of lower blood pressure targets. The knowledge gained will help clinicians to personalize the treatment of high blood pressure, which could reduce the burden of heart disease among millions of individuals worldwide.","Mitochondrial health, cardiovascular risk, and blood pressure targets in hypertensive adults",10210130,R01HL151564,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrolytes', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nuclear', 'Observational Study', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Play', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Syncope', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'genomic data', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'hypoperfusion', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'mitochondrial genome', 'mitochondrial metabolism', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'stressor', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'walking speed']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,757768
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"Cause and effect of transient changes in stress, gene expression, and RV fiber orientation during RV remodeling, and its impact on RV function and inter-ventricular coupling in pulmonary hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiopulmonary disease that ultimately leads to right ventricular (RV) failure. Currently there are no approved therapies targeting the RV and most research is focused on reducing fibrosis, although it is unclear if this will ultimately improve RV pumping function. However, the orientation of collagen and cardiomyocyte fibers likely have a major influence on RV function and are largely overlooked in ongoing research and clinical practice. Furthermore, the role of the LV in RV function is almost completely discounted, but previous research from the 90’s has suggested that the left ventricle (LV) is more important for RV function than the contracting RV free wall.  Our previous data has shown that the mechanics of LV contraction is drastically different in children with PH and in mice after pulmonary arterial banding (PAB). Furthermore, mathematical simulations of the heart in our lab have shown that the mechanical burden of the remodeling and pressure-overloaded RV can result in the mechanistic problems we see in both ventricles in children with PH. However, two critical questions remain unanswered: how do changes in RV structure impact RV and LV contractile mechanics, and how do these changes in LV contractile mechanics impact RV function?  In this study, we will combine the PAB mouse model with in silico simulations to investigate how changes in RV fiber orientation and stiffening, in the RV free wall, impact RV pumping function. Then, we will combine PAB with aortic constriction to study how RV remodeling interferes with LV torsion and if this interrupts LV-to-RV mechanical assistance during systole. Finally, by collecting a time course dataset of imaging and gene expression, we will identify genes that are directly impacted by changes in mechanical stress and how they trigger their downstream remodeling pathways.  By bridging the gap between gene expression, structure, function, and inter-ventricular contractile mechanics, this project could lead to a better understanding of adaptive vs. maladaptive remodeling pathways. Furthermore, our research is focused on identifying those remodeling characteristics with the biggest influence on function and could expose gene expression pathways that will serve as drug targets in future studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease with a high mortality rate due to ultimate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure. The overall hypothesis of this project is that a cascade of RV fiber re-orientation and changes in left ventricular (LV) contractile mechanics are potential targets to halt or reverse functional decline, which have not been explored. The successful completion of this project would confirm that these are targets worth pursuing and reveal the potential transcriptional and structural changes that could be exploited.","Cause and effect of transient changes in stress, gene expression, and RV fiber orientation during RV remodeling, and its impact on RV function and inter-ventricular coupling in pulmonary hypertension",10209842,R56HL152250,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collagen', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Targeting', 'Energy Transfer', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Fibrosis', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Physiologic intraventricular pressure', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Systole', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsion', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'clinical practice', 'connectin', 'constriction', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein expression', 'response', 'simulation', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R56,2021,404365
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026
"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Bundle-Branch Block', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mosses', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes', 'arm', 'base', 'cardiac implant', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistics', 'study population']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'porcine model', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Project Summary/Abstract Research: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality and drivers of healthcare costs in the United States. By 2030, the number of heart failure patients is projected to reach 8 million. If we could predict who will develop heart failure, this would create an opportunity to improve patient experiences and outcomes by initiating earlier behavioral and therapeutic interventions. Electronic health records (EHR) contain information that can be used to predict heart failure before its onset. However, the existing models lead to a large number of false positive predictions, limiting their clinical utility. The PI proposes to augment the EHR data with electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) features to improve the accuracy of predicting the onset of heart failure 12 months in advance. The three modalities of data (EHR, ECG and HRV) will be analyzed using deep learning methods, including novel techniques proposed by the PI. The models will be developed and validated retrospectively using patient data available at Michigan Medicine. The second aim of the proposal is to increase the impact of this research by replacing the clinically measured ECG and HRV with those obtained by consumer wearables such as smart watches. A prospective cohort of patients will wear a wearable device for seven days, which will allow the PI to determine whether the collected information (intermittent ECG, continuous HRV derived from photoplethysmography, and actigraphy), combined with EHR, can provide clinicians with a more effective tool to identify which patients are at risk of heart failure. While this approach will benefit a larger population of patients, it will still be limited to those with past medical history. To further expand the impact of this research to those who wear consumer wearables but have no previous medical history, a limited model that depends only on the information gathered by the wearable device will be evaluated. Thus, the outcomes of this study will include multiple models targeting various populations, such as those with and without prior medical history. Candidate / Career Development: Dr. Sardar Ansari is a computer scientist and statistician with expertise in biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and medical wearable devices. His past research experience includes analysis of ECG signal to improve detection of cardiac arrhythmias and reduce false alarms in intensive care units; detection and removal of noise and motion artifacts in biomedical signals such as ECG and bioimpedance; prediction of hemodynamic decompensation using HRV; and detection of hemorrhagic shock, intradialytic hypotension, and low cardiac index using wearable technology. This award will allow Dr. Ansari to acquire needed additional training in cardiovascular physiology and heart failure pathophysiology through mentorship, didactic training, attending workshops and scientific meetings, and clinical exposure, preparing him for an independent career focused on developing diagnostic and clinical decision support tools for cardiovascular medicine. Project Narrative Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but it is currently difficult to predict who will develop heart failure. In this study, we will apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to multiple types of data (electronic health records, electrocardiography, and heart rate variability) to predict heart failure onset, and we will use wearable devices to improve the predictions and expand their impact to a wider population. We expect the resulting tools will help prevent delayed diagnosis of heart failure, leading to improved medical outcomes, enhanced patient experience, and reduction in healthcare costs.","Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables",10300375,K01HL155404,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Home environment', 'Hypotension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'actigraphy', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'string theory', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,163865
"Risk stratification of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection using clinical and engineering analysis Project Summary  Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is a lethal disease which occurs when a tear develops in the inner lining (intimal layer) of the aorta, causing the layers of the aortic wall to separate (dissect) creating “true” and “false” lumens. Complicated TBADs with presence of either organ malperfusion or aortic rupture have a high in-hospital mortality rate and require emergent surgical or endovascular therapy. Uncomplicated TBADs have been traditionally managed with optimal medical therapy (OMT) consisting of aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy and surveillance imaging. OMT results in low in-hospital mortality rates, but dismal long-term survival rates of 48- 66%, and overall intervention-free survival rates of less than 50% secondary to aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. These poor long-term outcomes support a paradigm change in the treatment of the uncomplicated TBADs. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need for promptly identifying those uncomplicated TBAD patients that will likely fail OMT in the acute phase, and thus benefit from early intervention such as Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR).  Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a risk stratification model for predicting both failure of OMT and the optimal timing of intervention in uncomplicated TBAD patients. To achieve this goal, a retrospective analysis will be conducted for about 500 uncomplicated TBAD patients from the Emory Aortic Databank. Clinical and anatomic data will be harvested from the electronic medical record and image studies to identify predictors of OMT failure. Next, using the same patient database, a series of mechanical experiments will be performed to obtain hyperelastic and failure properties of the TBAD tissues, from which rupture/tear risk metrics will be developed. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses will be validated and applied to obtain “heat maps” of hemodynamic and wall stress fields. The risk indices will be consequently extracted. For patients with longitudinal imaging data, TBAD progression will be predicted using an integrated growth and remodeling (G&R) and dissection propagation model. Critical biomechanical parameters will be identified as potential predictors of OMT failure. Finally, machine learning (ML) techniques will be used to combine clinical and biomechanical predictors to develop a multi-factorial, personalized TBAD risk stratification model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we will recruit and perform a longitudinal follow-up study of 35 acute uncomplicated TBAD patients to validate our approach by comparing the ML-model- prediction results with actual clinical outcomes.

"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Understanding the Heterogeneity of Disease Expression and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of the myocardium that is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocyte disarray, and fibrosis. It is the most prevalent genetic heart disorder, affecting ~1 in 500 people. HCM has been the focus of intense clinical and basic science study for decades. These efforts have provided remarkable insights into the molecular basis and clinical course of disease-- defining sarcomere mutations as the most common genetic etiology and characterizing the phenotypic spectrum. Additionally, prior studies have underscored the great heterogeneity of HCM. Although many patients have serious outcomes, including arrhythmias, advanced heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, many others experience mild disease with low symptom burden and normal longevity. Moreover, there is striking diversity in cardiac morphology and function, even amongst patients with identical underlying sarcomere mutations. The factors that drive such marked heterogeneity are poorly understood, highlighting the critical need to better characterize determinants of disease expression and clinical outcomes.  This proposal seeks to identify genotypic and phenotypic features that account for the highly diverse manifestations of HCM. These goals will be addressed by leveraging the recently established Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), containing data on over 9000 HCM patients, and applying state-of- the-art genetic, imaging, and statistical analyses. Our aims are: (1) To identify common genetic variation that impacts disease expression in HCM patients both with and without a driving sarcomere mutation (sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric HCM). These analyses will interrogate background genetic variation to examine how an individual’s genetic make-up influences their susceptibility or resistance to disease. We will also develop polygenic risk scores to assess the cumulative effect of common genetic variants on disease expression. (2) To characterize phenotypic factors that influence disease expression by utilizing machine-learning techniques to identify novel, quantitative high-dimensional imaging features from routinely-performed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies. We will then incorporate these features into rigorous prediction models to improve clinical risk stratification. This approach will allow us to look more deeply into the structure and function of the heart by using the full array of digital data available from CMR imaging, thereby drawing new correlations between phenotype, disease manifestations, and clinical outcomes. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of why disease experience can be so different from patient to patient, provide new insights into mechanism and therapeutic targets, and identify novel biomarkers of disease severity. These results will impact clinical management of patients with HCM by improving the precision and accuracy of diagnosis and risk stratification. Finally, insights gained will likely inform more common forms of heart disease, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with similarly highly heterogeneous manifestations. NARRATIVE Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is heart muscle disease that can cause disabling symptoms, dangerous heart rhythm disturbances, and premature death. Mutations in the genes that encode the sarcomere, the molecular motor of the heart, are the most frequent cause of HCM, however, there is tremendous variation in disease experience from one patient to the next.

"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults.

"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African', 'African American', 'African Caribbean', 'Age', 'American Medical Association', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diphosphates', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Onset of illness', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prealbumin', 'Quality of life', 'Recontacts', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supportive care', 'Technetium', 'Technetium 99m', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'data repository', 'disease diagnosis', 'ethnic minority population', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multi-ethnic', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'scale up', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230
"Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record Project Summary/Abstract Over half of adult Americans use dietary supplements. However, little is known about their safety and effectiveness as these products are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and post-marketing surveillance is limited to adverse events. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) seeks to fill in that gap and has identified electronic health record (EHR) data as a potential tool to advance that goal. Preliminary data from our pilot study sponsored by the NIH ODS that used advanced machine/deep learning techniques suggest that magnesium supplements may lower the risk of heart failure (HF) in patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) and may improve outcomes in those with HF. Both HF and DM affect the health and outcomes of millions of Americans. DM is a risk factor for HF and adversely affects outcomes in those with HF. Magnesium is an integral part of over 300 human enzyme systems, which are impaired in magnesium deficiency. Findings from our study suggest that a low dietary magnesium intake is associated with a higher risk of incident HF, especially among those with DM. However, less is known about this relationship in patients with HF. The Specific Aims 1 and 2 of the proposed projects are to test the hypotheses that a new prescription for oral magnesium supplement is associated with a lower risk of incident HF in those with DM and of mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF. Although magnesium is inexpensive and relatively safe, its long-term effects may vary for individual patients. Thus, instead of recommending it to millions of patients, it would be ideal to recommend to individuals who are most likely to benefit. Thus, our Specific Aim 3 is to develop and validate a novel explainable deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine with precision the optimal clinical setting under which an individual may derive clinical benefits from magnesium supplementation given their individual characteristics including multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These aims will be achieved by interrogating the Veterans Affairs (VA) national EHR data that includes over 2 million Veterans with DM and 1 million with HF with ~20 years of longitudinal data on magnesium supplements, serum magnesium, and outcomes. We will use a new-user design, marginal structural model (propensity score weighting) with machine- learning-based estimation and stability analyses to minimize confounding and account for potential biases. The prediction model for individual risk/benefit will be validated using the Cerner Health Facts® data for generalizability in non-Veteran populations. The findings of proposed study will generate new evidence that will have direct clinical implications and those of Aim 3 specifically will provide a novel precision medicine tool to individualize magnesium supplement use. Project Narrative About 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure and one third of the patients with heart failure die within a year of the diagnosis. While lower blood magnesium levels have been linked with the incident and outcomes of heart failure, it is unknown whether magnesium supplements (~$0.05 each pill) may lower that risk. We propose to interrogate national electronic health record data from Veterans Health Administration using novel pharmacoepidemiology methodology and develop explainable deep-learning models to help clinicians and patients make personalized decisions to maximize the health benefits of magnesium supplements.",Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record,10301239,R01HL156518,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'American', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Magnesium', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intake', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Magnesium Deficiency', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Mg supplementation', 'Minerals', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Serum', 'Serum magnesium level observed', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'dietary supplements', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insulin sensitivity', 'interest', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'phenotypic data', 'pill', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled design', 'risk prediction model', 'therapeutic effectiveness', 'tool']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,200000
"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Award', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prognosis', 'Program Development', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'hands on research', 'healthcare community', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'study population', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of Americans, and also causes significant economic costs to the nation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms through which CVD develops is of paramount importance if we are to successfully identify those at risk for CVD, and intervene to ultimately prevent CVD-related death and economic impact. Psychological stress reactivity has long been appreciated as a risk factor for negative CVD- related outcomes, and recent work suggests that inflammatory reactivity to stress is a critical biological mechanism through which stress increases risk for CVD. However, there are significant gaps in our current knowledge regarding the neural predictors and molecular pathways through which stress leads to inflammation. These knowledge gaps are critical to fill if we are to develop a full mechanistic understanding of how stress leads to CVD risk, and may also shed light on future intervention targets. Thus, the present project will use cutting- edge computational methods to identify neural signatures of stress-related inflammatory reactivity, and will use pharmacological tools to block an important stress-signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) and examine its effects on neural and inflammatory reactivity to stress. Study 1 (N=100) will use fMRI to examine neural responses to a social evaluative stress task, with blood samples taken before and after the stressor assayed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and circulating inflammatory proteins. We will use innovative multivariate machine learning analytic techniques to identify the neural patterns that predict changes in inflammation, as well as network-based analytic tools from mathematics to examine how large-scale brain networks change configuration in response to stress in ways that are linked to inflammation. In Study 2 (N=120), we will conduct a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol to examine how blocking beta-adrenergic signaling impacts neural and inflammatory responses to the social evaluative stress task. Together, these two studies will allow us to establish the neural signatures of stress-induced increases in inflammation (Aim 1), determine the effects of beta-adrenergic signaling on neural responses to stress (Aim 2), and examine the neural mediators of beta-adrenergic related attenuations in stress-related inflammatory reactivity (Aim 3). In doing so, this project will ultimately help identify neural signatures of risk for stress-related inflammation, as well as novel targets for future intervention to ameliorate the impact of stress on the brain and body and reduce the health and economic burden of CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE What are the neural and molecular mechanisms through which psychological stress leads to an inflammatory response, thus increasing risk for cardiovascular disease? The present project will use neuroimaging and pharmacological tools to answer this question, exploring the neural activity patterns and brain network configuration in response to stress that is associated with increases in inflammation, as well as how experimentally blocking one important stress signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) shapes neural and inflammatory responses to stress. Ultimately, these studies will fill critical gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which stress may lead to cardiovascular disease risk, and help to identify novel targets for future interventions.",Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses,10185562,R01HL157422,"['Acute', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Affective', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Propranolol', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'attenuation', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'computational neuroscience', 'cytokine', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'health economics', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social genomics', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,621869
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Deciphering the Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Crosstalk in LMNA Cardiomyopathy Project Summary/Abstract Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and the leading reason for heart transplantation. Major gaps exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and mutations in the gene that encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C (LMNA) are considered to be the most common cause of DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie “cardiolaminopathy” remain elusive, and it is unknown why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene have such a disproportionate effect on the heart. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), we recently studied a family affected by DCM due to a frameshift variant in LMNA, which showed endothelial dysfunction (Sayed et al. Science Translational Medicine, 2020). This EC dysfunction could be reversed by upregulating Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) by treatment of iPSC-ECs with a subset of statins, including lovastatin. Importantly, this improvement in EC dysfunction had a positive effect on co-cultured iPSC- cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from cardiolaminopathy patients, indicating an intricate crosstalk between the ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy.  Despite impressive progress, little attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in CMs, especially in context to pharmacological stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a multidisciplinary approach that integrates human iPSCs, bioengineering tools, genome editing, and NGS to gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DCM. Using human iPSCs, we propose to decipher the impaired cross-talk between ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy and elucidate the beneficial class effects of statins in improving the EC-CM signaling as a key factor in regulating cardiac function. We will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the genotype-phenotype association of LMNA mutations on ECs and CMs. For this, we will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived cells with 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived EHTs using single-cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA cardiomyopathy by using CRISPR technology and zebrafish animal model. We have provided compelling preliminary data to support the soundness of our hypothesis-driven research proposal, and we are well positioned to achieve the project goals within five years. If successful, our studies will provide a new paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of familial DCM. Project Narrative Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complex cardiac disease is a leading cause of heart failure. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers an experimental human-based model to predict and model individual disease manifestations. The goal of this project is to study the underlying mechanisms of DCM by investigating the intricate crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells using bioengineering tools and next generation sequencing. Results from this work could potentially lead to new strategies that could lower morbidity and mortality, but also improve the management of DCM patients.",Deciphering the Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Crosstalk in LMNA Cardiomyopathy,10276748,R01HL158641,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lamin Type A', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Lovastatin', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organ', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Proposals', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'cell type', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'env Gene Products', 'experimental study', 'familial dilated cardiomyopathy', 'genome editing', 'heart function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'induced pluripotent stem cell technology', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knock-down', 'lamin C', 'loss of function', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'paracrine', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'sound', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,393500
"Mayo Clinic HeartShare Clinical Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the NIH HeartShare Research Consortium as a HeartShare Clinical Center (CC). Our goal is to collaborate with the other HeartShare Investigators to elucidate the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and discover novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Multiple pathophysiologic processes may ultimately lead to different HFpEF phenotypes, though the specific mechanisms remain largely undefined. It is also not known whether standard clinical information can identify patients with different mechanistic etiologies, which is necessary to provide targeted therapies in clinical trials and eventually in clinical practice. Our proposal outlines four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1: We document that Mayo Clinic has the resources and the Mayo HeartShare Team has the expertise and track record of productivity in HFpEF and relevant related diseases, clinical research, patient recruitment and retention, data science, and collaborative team science to help drive the success of HeartShare Network. In Specific Aim 2: We propose a broad mechanistic phenotyping protocol providing quantitative variables reflective of senescence, systemic disease processes, and multi-organ integrity (L2 data), which are used as input variables in unsupervised machine learning (ML) models. We hypothesize that this approach will allow identification of unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroups (clusters). We also propose invasive hemodynamic signatures, trans-cardiac gradients of circulating biomarkers and myocardial, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue characterization (L3 data) be obtained in a subset within each HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroup. We hypothesize these L3 data will enhance identification of targeted therapeutic strategies. Lastly, we outline supervised ML using EHR data to develop automatable algorithms to accurately identify the HeartShare HFpEF pathophysiological phenogroups derived using L2 data. We hypothesize that if successful, this approach will enhance translation of HeartShare findings by allowing automated identification of patients in the different HFpEF phenogroups for enrollment in clinical trials of agents targeting their specific pathophysiology. In Specific Aim 3: We propose that use of circulating proteins alone (n=5000; defined by the SOMAScanTM Aptamer based platform) as input variables for unsupervised ML models will identify unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenotypes (clusters). In Specific Aim 4: We outline the Mayo HeartShare Research Skills Development Program. Providing HFpEF clinical investigators a short-term intensive immersion experience by collaboration with a data scientist intern in the Mayo Cardiovascular Disease AI Internship or a long term dedicated program in data science as a Mayo Kern Center Scholar in Data Science will equip a new generation of HFpEF investigators with a robust data science toolbox to drive future discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ LAY SUMMARY This proposal represents Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the HeartShare Research Consortium, a program established by the National Institutes of Health. This team science initiative will be enabled by advances in data science and focus on determining the causes of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

"HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets PROJECT SUMMARY  The Overarching Aim of the Northwestern HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets is to provide overall management and oversight for HeartShare, including coordination and communication across all subsections and cores of the program, and with the 4 HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs). The Data Translation Center (DTC) will need to ensure timely completion of the retrospective and prospective components of HeartShare. In our application, we demonstrate the ability and prior experience of our multi-PI team and core leaders in the conduct and leadership of large-scale, multi-center studies, particularly in the realms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), electronic health record (EHR)-based investigation, deep phenotyping, machine learning, and biorepositories. For both the retrospective and prospective HeartShare components, the Northwestern DTC will leverage its considerable experience in: (1) cohorts and trials that have data on adjudicated HF patients, and (2) its leadership and track record as the top enroller in HFpEF trials/studies to ensure optimal recruitment by the HeartShare CCs. We will also leverage our expertise in HFpEF, data coordination/management, BioData Catalyst, EHR-based research, biostatistics, machine learning, multi-omics, human-computer interaction, and mobile health data monitoring to (1) successfully execute the HeartShare program and (2) meet the HeartShare DTC goals of providing a rich resource to the research community to advance the science of next-generation phenomics to identify HFpEF subtypes and therapeutic targets. Our HeartShare DTC will carry out each of its 4 primary responsibilities. (1) The Administrative and Outreach Core will oversee HeartShare program operations, research skills development, and capitation to CCs for deep phenotyping costs; support a call center to follow patient outcomes; and promote rapid and broad data-sharing of clinical and molecular data.

"CHIcago Center for Accelerating nextGen Omics, deep phenotyping, and data science in Heart Failure (CHICAGO-HF) ABSTRACT  This application proposing the CHIcago Center for Accelerating nextGen Omics, deep phenotyping, and data science in Heart Failure (CHICAGO-HF) is in response to the RFA “HeartShare: Next-Generation Phenomics to Define Heart Failure Subtypes and Treatment Targets-Clinical Centers.” Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in prevalence. No effective disease-modifying therapies exist for patients with HFpEF, largely due to the substantial heterogeneity among patients with HFpEF for whom the current “one-size-fits-all” treatment paradigm is failing. A large-scale, multicenter observational study to conduct deep phenotyping in patients with HFpEF is a critical next step to advance our understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology and shift our clinical and research paradigm in HFpEF towards a precision medicine approach. We propose three central elements that are critical to address to comprehensively phenotype patients across the spectrum of HFpEF. First, direct phenotyping of the myocardium, using tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endomyocardial biopsy, is necessary to elucidate the intrinsic myocardial biology of HFpEF. Second, detailed phenotyping of the complex interplay of extra-cardiac comorbidities is needed to better understand the systemic nature of HFpEF. Third, a representative sample of HFpEF patients with diversity across sex, race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic status needs to be included in phenotyping efforts to prevent widening of well-documented disparities in HFpEF. The proposed Clinical Center, CHICAGO-HF, led by Northwestern, is uniquely qualified to participate in all aspects of the HeartShare Network and to substantially enhance the Network’s goals. In our application, we demonstrate key prior experiences, which include: (1) development of the world’s first dedicated clinical program in HFpEF; (2) recruitment of large numbers of patients with HFpEF into multicenter observational studies and trials; and (3) participation as a Field Center for NHLBI-funded cohorts. Our well- resourced multi-disciplinary investigative team has expertise in epidemiology, informatics, deep phenotyping, and artificial intelligence. We will leverage our experiences with our robust electronic health record infrastructure to efficiently collect, harmonize and share retrospective and prospective data on a large number of diverse patients with HFpEF and age- and sex-matched controls (HF with reduced and mid-range EF and healthy controls). We will prospectively recruit at least 250 patients within the study timeline with community partners across Chicago (e.g. Federally Qualified Health Centers). In addition, our unique expertise in innovative MRI techniques and data analytics can strengthen the Network and will enable testing of significant and innovative hypotheses to define unique phenotypes, elucidate distinct endotypes that represent underlying pathobiology, and identify novel targeted therapeutics for HFpEF. CHICAGO-HF is ideally suited to serve as a Clinical Center and contribute to the Network’s long-term mission to equitably improve HFpEF outcomes. NARRATIVE  This project is relevant to public health because we will collaborate with the NHLBI and the HeartShare Network to generate new knowledge regarding unique subtypes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and underlying mechanisms to ultimately improve patient outcomes. Specifically, the CHIcago Center for Accelerating nextGen Omics, deep phenotyping, and data science in Heart Failure (CHICAGO-HF) proposes to contribute to the development of retrospective and prospective cohorts of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and controls. We aim to strengthen the Network through our considerable experience and expertise in epidemiology, informatics, magnetic resonance imaging, and artificial intelligence.","CHIcago Center for Accelerating nextGen Omics, deep phenotyping, and data science in Heart Failure (CHICAGO-HF)",10327554,U01HL160279,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Illinois', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Sodium', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'patient population', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'support network', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,282411
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level.

The first goal of this supplement is to determine a way to use nutritional information to identify understandable food patterns that protect against heart disease. Three established biological pathways that we will consider relating diet to CVD are blood pressure, BMI, and cholesterol. We will compare how well various supervised and unsupervised methods construct interpretable diet patterns to predict each of these heart disease risk factors. The analyses with MESA data will be supplemented with simulation studies to demonstrate performance on a broader range of data. We suspect that Lasso and Sparse Multi-Block Partial Least Squares (SMBPLS) will perform the best, as they both incorporate variable selection and use outcome information. We compare these to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as it is a common technique used in nutritional science and can ground our comparison for that audience. The second goal is to improve upon current statistical methods, and we focus on extending SMBPLS specifically. While SMBPLS is useful to analyze the relationship between diet and our three CVD pathways (blood pressure, BMI, and cholesterol), this analysis method is limited to continuous linear endpoints. Other relevant endpoints exist that would be interesting to explore, such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and time to CVD event. In particular, the relationship between CAC and diet has not been well established, so this could be a valuable scientific contribution. Although CAC score is continuous, it is unusually distributed, so it has been analyzed as a binary outcome (none vs. any) in the past. Thus, the focus of the second goal would be to extend SMBPLS so that it is equipped to analyze more generalized endpoints. n/a","OPTION 1: MEAS TASK AREA A DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT - SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING, JANUARY 6, 2021-JANUARY 5, 2022.",10470994,5N92020D00001,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Communication Research', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Event', 'Food Patterns', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Lasso', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Science', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'research data dissemination', 'simulation', 'skills']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,N01,2021,65490
