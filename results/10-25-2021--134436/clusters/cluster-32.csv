"5TH AND 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES ON ISMB DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract) In the field of computational biology,      an important emerging specialty is the use of intelligent systems in support     of molecular biology.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)      conference provides a unique venue for the dissemination of recent               developments in this field and for the interchange of ideas between              experimental molecular biologists and computer scientists, mathematicians,       and statisticians.  The ISMB-97 conference will be held in Halkidiki, Greece     and the ISMB-98 conference will be held at the University of Montreal,           Canada.  These locales continue the tradition of alternating between North       America and Europe.                                                                                                                                               This grant request is for travel funds to enable students and young              scientists to attend ISMB-97 and ISMB-98.

"Evidence-Based Practice II: Faculty & Curriculum Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western States Chiropractic College (in conjunction with the Oregon Health & Science University) has successfully implemented the 1st version of the new EBP curriculum and initial training of the faculty. The principal goal of this grant renewal will be to build upon and improve the new EBP curriculum and to integrate it more seamlessly into the institutional and cultural fabric of the College so that gains made during the first grant cycle are sustained. To achieve this goal, further attention must be paid to ensuring program sustainability, broadening faculty EBP skills and involvement, disseminating EBP processes and products to the chiropractic and CAM communities, enhancing the application of EBP methods at the clinical level, and continuing program evaluation. To this end, five aims have been identified with a number of projects to accomplish them. Aim 1 is to assess, revise, and manage the new EBP curriculum. This will be accomplished through three projects. The EBP curriculum developed in the first grant will be assessed and updated. Faculty teaching EBP learning modules will coordinate class assignments and address gaps/overlap. Support tools will be developed and maintained for use by students and instructors. Aim 2 is to enhance the faculty development program with three projects. Advanced faculty EBP training will include course seminars in literature search and critical appraisal, teaching strategies, and biostatistics. A faculty mentoring program will be developed to address the needs of the individual faculty members. A self- directed, mentor-assisted program for new faculty will also be developed to cover required EBP skills. Aim 3 is to increase professional outreach. A conference will be presented on EBP teaching and program development for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) institutions. Postgraduate seminars will also be conducted on application of EBP for practicing chiropractors and other CAM practitioners. Aim 4 is to expand clinical application of EBP by developing a care pathway for patient care. Faculty will use EBP principles to create protocols for assessing and managing commonly seen headaches for specific use in our chiropractic clinic system. Aim 5 is to evaluate the EBP program. We will continue to assess student knowledge, attitudes, and skills using instruments from the first grant; we will develop new instruments to evaluate EBP practice and barriers for alumni. We will assess student and faculty satisfaction with EBP training. Finally, we will monitor program implementation in the classroom and clinic system. The program is innovative in that, rather than renovating a single course in EBP or course series, it seeks to integrate EBP skills and knowledge across an entire curriculum, and to simultaneously develop an EBP- literate college faculty as opposed to simply developing a few content experts. Success of such a program could have a significant impact on how chiropractic colleges approach teaching EBP.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will enhance the training of chiropractic students in evidence-based practice (EBP). Through resources made available through this grant, chiropractors and other complementary and alternative medicine practitioners will develop greater EBP skills. They will be better able to apply the best available care to their patients to the benefit of society.

"BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE NETWORK The purpose of the five year IAIMS phase III implementation project at the Georgetown University Medical Center is to develop a Biotechnology and Biomedical Knowledge Network that makes multiple information resources available electronically in a manner which is easy to use from home, office, laboratory or clinical setting. The Knowledge Network will allow scientists to sequence multiple proteins, fold DNA molecules and analyze raw data.  Health care practitioners will be able to prepare diagnostic work-ups via voice, transmit images in digitized format, and conduct disease staging on cancer patients.  Students will use hypertext systems with multiple windows to knowledge resources and information tools. A special component to prepare information science professionals as IAIMS Trainees will be established.  The project focuses on major research interest at Georgetown University Medical Center in Aging, AIDS, Bioethics, Biotechnology, Cancer, Neurosciences and Radiology.  There are five project objectives.  (1)  To develop Sources of Knowledge including bibliographic, factual, diagnostic, full text and laboratory systems that aid clinical problems solving and medical decision making.  (2)  To establish Scholar Workstations for Students, Practitioners, Researchers and Faculty to access, create, and share information from a single vantage point.  (3)  To achieve System integration to broaden user access by expanding the local area network (LAN), by developing BioSynthesis, an intelligent retrieval system with gateway access capabilities and multiple database integration, and by experimenting in man- machine communication via voice recognition to improve physician- computer interface and data entry.  (4)  To extend the computer training services of the Biomedical Information Resources Center and to conduct Medical Informatics Projects.  (5)  To implement Cooperative Projects to share IAIMS resources with affiliated hospitals and other IAIMS sites.  Funds requested to successfully implement IAIMS represent partial support of the project.

(1)  To develop Sources of Knowledge including bibliographic, factual, diagnostic, full text and laboratory systems that aid clinical problems solving and medical decision making.  (2)  To establish Scholar Workstations for Students, Practitioners, Researchers and Faculty to access, create, and share information from a single vantage point.  (3)  To achieve System integration to broaden user access by expanding the local area network (LAN), by developing BioSynthesis, an intelligent retrieval system with gateway access capabilities and multiple database integration, and by experimenting in man- machine communication via voice recognition to improve physician- computer interface and data entry.  (4)  To extend the computer training services of the Biomedical Information Resources Center and to conduct Medical Informatics Projects.  (5)  To implement Cooperative Projects to share IAIMS resources with affiliated hospitals and other IAIMS sites.  Funds requested to successfully implement IAIMS represent partial support of the project.  Georgetown is deriving significant funds from its own and other resources in order to accomplish the objectives of the Biotechnology and Biomedical Knowledge Network. Moreover, as one of the pioneering IAIMS institutions, Georgetown accepts responsibility to share its experiences.  n/a",BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE NETWORK,3058388,G08LM004392,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical resource', ' biotechnology', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' health care facility information system', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' information systems']",NLM,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,G08,1989,641500,0.0827494660480426
"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.  n/a",COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS,3373747,R01LM004487,"['anemia', ' artificial intelligence', ' blood tests', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' coronary disorder', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' heart disorder diagnosis', ' medical education']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,1990,55126,0.14312305447146498

"CSHL Computational and Comparative Genomics Course The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue a course entitled “Computational and Comparative Genomics”, to be held in the Fall of 2017 – 2019. The Computational and Comparative Genomics course provides experimental biologists with backgrounds in molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry with the theoretical background and practical experience necessary to use and evaluate computational approaches to genome annotation and analysis, including protein sequence database searching, multiple sequence alignment, identification of promoters and other genetic regulatory elements, and the integration of sequence information into broader models of biological function. The course also provides computer scientists and mathematicians with an introduction to the algorithms, computational methods, and biological problems that are addressed in biological sequence analysis and computational biology. For post-doctoral fellows, and junior and senior investigators who are interested in changing their research direction towards computational biology, the course provides an introduction to computational biology methods and a survey of future directions. Over a seven day period, the students receive a strong grounding in the both the biological and computer science foundations for genome analysis and practical computer laboratory experience on challenging problems. The course is taught by internationally recognized leaders in the field, who provide hands-on demonstrations of the programs and biological databases that they have developed. At the end of the course, students can not only use effectively currently available tools in biological sequence analysis, they can also evaluate critically new computational approaches by considering alternative methods and interpretations, and appreciate the strengths and limitations of computational methods for answering broad biological questions. NARRATIVE The Computational & Comparative Genomics, a 9 day course, is designed to meet the continuing need for training in computational biology, statistics, and computer science for molecular biologists and geneticists with backgrounds in experimental biology.

"CRCNS: Dyanamic and Distributed Memory in Olfaction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual merit: A combined experimental-computational approach will be used to understand the differences between unsupervised and supervised learning using olfactory processing as a model system. It is becoming increasingly clear that different forms of plasticity are distributed across different layers of processing during olfactory learning. The honey bee will be used as a model for studying these different forms of plasticity in behavioral experiments involving different kinds of conditioning experience combined with simultaneous multiunit recordings of the outputs of two sequential layers of olfactory processing - the Antennal Lobe and Mushroom Body. Combining behavior with electrophysiology in the same animals allows for investigation of how different forms of plasticity interact with the transformation of spatiotemporal 'transient' activity patterns in the AL to sparse, spatial representations in the MB. Our group also has developed models of the AL and MB that produce realistic spiking activity patterns. In the proposal these models will continue to be extended to investigate how unsupervised and supervised (reinforcement-based) learning may be implemented in the AL and MB. For example, recent immunohistochemical analyses by one of our laboratories of the reinforcement pathway in the honey bee brain have revealed that reinforcement targets inhibitory pathways both in the AL and MB. These inhibitory pathways are important for generating transient activity patterns in the AL and the sparse coding in the MB. This information will be used to implement plasticity in the computational models. Although these models provide predictions and guidance they are still far from a clear convergence with electrophysiological and behavioral data. The work proposed in this proposal is aimed toward development of an integrative view in which new data will refine development of the models, and the models will help to guide experimental approaches. For example, spike time dependent plasticity and Hebbian learning are dominant when there is no reward and non-supervised learning occurs. On the other hand, in the honey bee octopamine release from a well-established reward pathway is critical for reinforcement learning. Our preliminary models show that Hebbian type of learning increases the similarity of correlated patterns while it separates dissimilar patterns. On the other hand, reinforcement learning operates against the Hebbian-type of rules by increasing correlations between dissimilar patterns or separating highly correlated encoded signals. The current proposal focuses on empirically and computationally testing what underlying biophysical mechanisms can lead to such observations.    Future directions: Smith's laboratory has developed a means to disrupt the octopamine-mediated reward pathway in the honey bee brain (Farooqui et al 2003). In the future, this study can be extended to include targeted disruption of this and other pathways important for plasticity to test the predictions of the modeling.    Enhancing public health: At least 3,000,000 Americans suffer from chemosensory disorders and that is likely to grow as the aging segment of the population increases. Olfactory impairment leads to inability to detect hazards such as natural gas and spoiled food. Olfaction is also an important early signal of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease.    Broader impacts: It is expected that the outcome of this research will also improve the development of algorithms for processing sensor arrays of metaoxide sensors for volatile odor compound identification that is currently funded in one of our groups through a MURI award from the Navy. The goal of the MURI project is to develop biomimetic algorithms for odor localization in robots. Furthermore, behavioral work with honey bees is inexpensive and easy to learn. One of our laboratories continuously involves undergraduate students as researchers through an HHMI funded undergraduate research program. The researchers are frequently coauthors on publications, as was the case for two students on a recent publication (Fernandez et al, 2009, J Neuroscience 29, 10191-202).

"CRCNS: Dyanamic and Distributed Memory in Olfaction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual merit: A combined experimental-computational approach will be used to understand the differences between unsupervised and supervised learning using olfactory processing as a model system. It is becoming increasingly clear that different forms of plasticity are distributed across different layers of processing during olfactory learning. The honey bee will be used as a model for studying these different forms of plasticity in behavioral experiments involving different kinds of conditioning experience combined with simultaneous multiunit recordings of the outputs of two sequential layers of olfactory processing - the Antennal Lobe and Mushroom Body. Combining behavior with electrophysiology in the same animals allows for investigation of how different forms of plasticity interact with the transformation of spatiotemporal 'transient' activity patterns in the AL to sparse, spatial representations in the MB. Our group also has developed models of the AL and MB that produce realistic spiking activity patterns. In the proposal these models will continue to be extended to investigate how unsupervised and supervised (reinforcement-based) learning may be implemented in the AL and MB. For example, recent immunohistochemical analyses by one of our laboratories of the reinforcement pathway in the honey bee brain have revealed that reinforcement targets inhibitory pathways both in the AL and MB. These inhibitory pathways are important for generating transient activity patterns in the AL and the sparse coding in the MB. This information will be used to implement plasticity in the computational models. Although these models provide predictions and guidance they are still far from a clear convergence with electrophysiological and behavioral data. The work proposed in this proposal is aimed toward development of an integrative view in which new data will refine development of the models, and the models will help to guide experimental approaches. For example, spike time dependent plasticity and Hebbian learning are dominant when there is no reward and non-supervised learning occurs. On the other hand, in the honey bee octopamine release from a well-established reward pathway is critical for reinforcement learning. Our preliminary models show that Hebbian type of learning increases the similarity of correlated patterns while it separates dissimilar patterns. On the other hand, reinforcement learning operates against the Hebbian-type of rules by increasing correlations between dissimilar patterns or separating highly correlated encoded signals. The current proposal focuses on empirically and computationally testing what underlying biophysical mechanisms can lead to such observations.    Future directions: Smith's laboratory has developed a means to disrupt the octopamine-mediated reward pathway in the honey bee brain (Farooqui et al 2003). In the future, this study can be extended to include targeted disruption of this and other pathways important for plasticity to test the predictions of the modeling.    Enhancing public health: At least 3,000,000 Americans suffer from chemosensory disorders and that is likely to grow as the aging segment of the population increases. Olfactory impairment leads to inability to detect hazards such as natural gas and spoiled food. Olfaction is also an important early signal of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease.    Broader impacts: It is expected that the outcome of this research will also improve the development of algorithms for processing sensor arrays of metaoxide sensors for volatile odor compound identification that is currently funded in one of our groups through a MURI award from the Navy. The goal of the MURI project is to develop biomimetic algorithms for odor localization in robots. Furthermore, behavioral work with honey bees is inexpensive and easy to learn.

"Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research Optimizing the Utility of Electronic Medical Records Data in  Data-driven Health Research ABSTRACT Medical centers continue to archive patient follow-up data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), which have tremendous value in discovering new knowledge and insights. The large volume of EMR data can play an important role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models in healthcare, especially when misdiagnosis is known to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. Despite these merits, EMR data are invariably corrupted by factors like missing values, outliers, and unrealistic measurements, which prevent researchers from fully utilizing such abundant data in many important studies. Many studies simply discard a large number of samples to get rid of missingness and eventually bias their data-driven analytical models. Existing techniques for missing data imputation use simplified linear models and are mostly suitable for imputing cross-sectional data missingness that ignore longitudinal missingness in patient follow-up data. This proposal aims to investigate novel artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve the quality and utility of EMR data in preparation for data-driven retrospective studies. Toward this preparation, the goal of the project is 1) to investigate more accurate and robust data imputation models compared to existing ones and 2) adapt state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in preparing optimal representation of large EMR data. The proposed research will 1) maximize the quality and utility of EMR data to support a multitude of retrospective studies, 2) enable visualization of complex patient data, 3) identify more important and predictive clinical parameters, 4) yield a compact and optimal representation of large EMR datasets. We hypothesize that optimally processed EMR data with state-of-the-art AI models can most accurately model patient risk when compared to existing statistical and clinical risk models. This project will combine the complementary expertise of the collaborators, Dr. Manar Samad, PhD (Computer Science), Dr. Owen Johnson, DPH (Biostatistics and Public Health), and Dr. Edilberto Raynes, MD, PhD (Medicine) along with the participating undergraduate students at Tennessee State University (TSU). The proposal entails several research and development components that will allow undergraduate students to gain valuable research and analytical skills in data science, programming, and health informatics. The project activities will expose health science students to AI-based computing solutions to broaden their scope of future health research and career. This project will help TSU prepare a strong workforce of minority students who will gain competitive skill sets in data science and health informatics that are currently high in demand almost everywhere. Overall, the project will develop a data-capable workforce to strengthen an interdisciplinary research capacity and collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health science at TSU. Project Narrative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data are invariably corrupted by data missingness and data redundancy that limit their application in many valuable data-driven research studies aiming to achieve the goals of precision medicine. This project aims to develop a number of innovative computational frameworks that will optimally prepare and utilize EMR data to facilitate research studies with relevance to patient risk modeling, discovery of new health markers, and patient-specific prognosis and therapeutic strategy. The project will leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science by involving an interdisciplinary team of researchers consisting of three faculty members, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students, which will establish a data-centric research collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health Science.",Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research,10111205,R15LM013569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'complex data ', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'minority student', 'neural network', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,421700,0.14184779785326987
"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.20911355545544627

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,0.04253610981494049
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry.

The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7220194,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2007,366168,0.15016739864958975
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantum has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the first artificial intelligence (Al) tutoring systems in chemistry education. This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics. n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software,6880607,R43EY016251,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blind aid', 'chemistry', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'educational resource design /development', 'science education', 'technology /technique development']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2005,100721,0.06903100774775711
"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.19072555970593288
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology.

"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.15589706944055062
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions. This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduate to attend and participate in the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, to be held in Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE international Symposium on Biomedical Imaging is to bring together researchers with interests in the mathematical and computational aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. The conference covers biomedical imaging problems of high relevance to human health, and hence is of high relevance to the interests of the National Institute of Health.",IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,9685477,R13EB027566,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging problem', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Privatization', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'authority', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'career', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'early-career faculty', 'editorial', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'member', 'physical model', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'student participation', 'success', 'supportive environment', 'symposium', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R13,2019,10000,0.07423654429612901
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications.

"Summer Institute in Geriatric Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Section of Geriatrics at Boston University Medical Center and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) propose to sponsor the 23rd through 27th Summer Institutes in Geriatric Medicine (SIGMs) in June 2011 through 2015 for third and fourth year medical students from across the United States. This five-day intensive educational program is designed specifically to encourage them to pursue careers in academic Geriatric Medicine with an emphasis on research. The rationale for funding the next five SIGMs derives from the continued modest level of interest in Geriatric Medicine among medical students and the need to nurture those students who will be most capable of thriving in academic medicine. Our aim is to expose medical students during their clinical training years to biomedical, clinical, and translational research in Aging/Geriatrics. Furthermore, the SIGMs aim to expose medical students to successful role models and mentors in aging research, filling the gap that exists in many medical schools with small Geriatric Medicine programs. The specific aims of the SIGMS are to: (1) Introduce medical students to clinical research methods, pertinent to Geriatric Medicine, by providing: a) clinical seminars addressing key clinical geriatric issues coupled with state-of the- art research presentations by senior physician scientists; b) seminars on evidence-based skills for searching the literature and on key methodological issues in studies of older adults; and c) small group discussions designed to allow students the opportunity to conceptualize and develop a focused research proposal. (2) Introduce medical students to role models in academic Geriatric Medicine by providing: a) small group interactions as an integral part of clinical and research seminars; b) a panel on career opportunities in academic Geriatric Medicine; c) home visits with clinical academic preceptors; and d) information about pathways through residency and fellowship training to careers in academic Geriatric Medicine. 3) Provide students the opportunity to develop a collegial community with other students from throughout the United States who plan careers in Geriatric Medicine, providing support and reinforcement for this choice of career path. The rationale for the Summer Institute in Geriatric Medicine (SIGM) derives from the continued modest level of interest in Geriatric Medicine among medical students and the need to nurture those students who will be most capable of thriving in academic medicine.

"Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference MIPS XVIII brings together an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XVIII is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Trafton Drew, PhD (University of Utah Psychology) and William Auffermann, MD, PhD (University of Utah Radiology); and committee Lauren Williams (University of Utah) trainee member, David Alonso trainee member (University of Utah). It will run July 14-17, 2019 at the University of Utah Guest House & Conference Center located near the University of Utah campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XVIII, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus theme is addressing other image-based specialties outside radiology. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XVIII. To date, 115 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 115 students have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference,9833051,R13EB028683,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malpractice', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physician&apos', 's Role', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'health care quality', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,10000,0.16932218649681416
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists. Project Narrative This conference will bring together medical, scientific, engineering, and applied mathematical researchers to present their newest research for a range of tomographic problems. Graduate students and beginners will be encouraged to participate and learn by being offered introductory talks, a student poster session, a welcome event, and an informal atmosphere. The conference will be structured so researchers will learn about important challenges in practical tomography as well as new techniques and methods, thereby creating synergies and research connections among the areas.",Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack,9837131,R13EB028700,"['Achievement', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Earth science', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lightning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'higher level mathematics', 'informal atmosphere', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation', 'posters', 'professor', 'recruit', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tomography', 'training opportunity', 'web site']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R13,2019,10000,0.05117600316331133
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification.

"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 Project Summary This R13 application will provide travel support for competitively selected U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to present their work at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 to be held April 4-8, 2020 at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. ISBI is a scientific conference dedicated to mathematical, algorithmic, and computational aspects of biological and biomedical imaging, across all scales of observation (from microscopic to whole-body imaging) and is sponsored by both the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). It attracts approximately 600-700 attendees each year involved in biomedical imaging research and development from academic institutions, government laboratories, and private companies. Since its inception in 2002, ISBI has become a leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of four-page papers which are peer-reviewed much like journal articles. In addition to oral and poster presentations of peer-reviewed papers in multiple tracks during the main conference, ISBI 2020 will also include special student events, tutorials, a “clinical day” emphasizing multi-disciplinary presentations/collaborations, plenary talks, workshops, and onsite grand challenges. Recipients of the travel awards will be competitively selected based on need and scientific excellence. U.S.- based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with accepted papers will be eligible to apply. We will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women and under-represented groups to help increase the diversity of the attendees. We anticipate that the travel awards will provide sufficient funding to the awardees to make the cost-benefit ratio for attendance extremely favorable. Through their attendance at ISBI, the awardees will benefit through their exposure to the simultaneous breadth and depth of topics offered at ISBI (presented by a mixture of leaders in the field as well as those early in their careers), their experience of presenting their work at an international conference, and their interactions and discussions with other attendees and leaders in the field. The conference as a whole will also benefit by not only enabling the high-quality work of the attendees to be presented but by also enabling an increased attendance of (and discussions/ideas/interactions with) U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty with diverse backgrounds.

"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2020 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation and facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing and computer assisted interventions, including biomedical imaging and robotics. This aim is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s--Visualization in Biomedical Computing, Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine, and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery--, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined new scientific disciplines over the years and have become the premier meeting in the field. The conference proceedings have an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & medical image processing, computer-aided diagnosis, interventions & surgery, machine learning in medical imaging, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance). Selected presented papers became landmark publications over the years with up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes satellite events like community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These events focus on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very well attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40%). The MICCAI 2020 Conference will be held in Lima, Peru in October 4th-8th, 2020. Since 2018, a Mentorship Program to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry is also part of the conference. Along with the Mentorship Program and mission of the “Women in MICCAI” Committee, this proposal requests funds to support student and early investigator travel awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10071524,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2020,10000,0.11616869109787457
"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the dissertation is to shed light on the question of what linguistic knowledge available to children language learners is innate as opposed to being gleaned post-natally from the environment, and to do it by answering a more basic question: what, if it were innate, would assist language learning, and what would not? The method involves implementing a formal model for learning a basic but quite versatile kind of grammar for natural language syntax using methods borrowed from machine learning and statistics, along with methods from theories of syntax and semantics in linguistics. Experiments comparing results from the methods to be implemented with those of other, existing unsupervised learning systems for grammatical inference as benchmarks will be carried out, computing measures of performance commonly accepted by computational linguists to assess the accuracy of competing grammars. Initially the testing will be done on small sets of data, but with a view to eventual scaling up so that the system can be trained on large sets of data characterizing actual natural language use in conversational contexts.         n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,7007660,F31HD041927,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'computer simulation', 'language development', 'learning', 'predoctoral investigator', 'syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2006,29424,0.028117077168254415

"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware.

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, and 3- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs four developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR-Cayeyand at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, 2) motivational visiting scientists, and 3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPRC alumni who will be biomedical research scientists. During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS Alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPRC scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases. n/a",University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program,7625307,R25GM059429,"['Academy', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Appendix', 'Application procedure', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Bibliography', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Career Choice', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Chemistry', 'Class', 'Cloning', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Congresses', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Critiques', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Daughter', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'District of Columbia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Formulations', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Psychology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Research', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Generations', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Hispanics', 'Histology', 'Holidays', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'IACUC', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Island', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Tables', 'Literature', 'Location', 'London', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Mails', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'National Research Council', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Piedra', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Principles of law and justice', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Productivity', 'Program Evaluation', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Readiness', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Remedial Teaching', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Technics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Sea Urchins', 'Selection Criteria', 'Self Assessment', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Son', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Suby&apos', 's G solution', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Title', 'Today', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Travel Document', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videotape', 'Visit', 'Vocation', 'Wages', 'Waiting Lists', 'Week', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'concept', 'cost', 'day', 'design', 'desire', 'essays', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'feeding', 'follow-up', 'foreign language', 'gene cloning', 'health disparity', 'high school', 'immunocytochemistry', 'impression', 'improved', 'instructor', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'literacy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'posters', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'publication formats', 'research and development', 'response', 'role model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'theories', 'time use', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'university student', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PR CAYEY UNIVERSITY COLL,R25,2008,58500,0.15788449256002574

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies.

"EPCC's RISE to the Challenge Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  El Paso Community College (EPCC), a Hispanic Serving Institution with an 88% Minority student enrollment submits this competing continuation application to the MBRS RISE Program. The overall goal is to develop EPCC into a gateway to biomedical professional research careers for minority and disadvantaged students that have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences. The RISE Program will continue developing a mutually supportive learning community by actively engaging our students, faculty and the community in appropriate enrichment, developmental and research activities. This will ultimately lead to an increase in the number of EPCC students transferring to four-year institutions and pursuing a biomedical research career.      EPCC's RISE to the Challenge Program consists of Student, Faculty, Community and Institutional Development Activities. All activities are aimed at increasing the number of minority and disadvantaged students acquiring the tools necessary to succeed in college and pursue biomedical research careers. The goals and objectives of EPCC's RISE Program are consistent with the mission of the MBRS RISE Program to enhance the research environment at minority institutions. The program is divided into five components:      I) The Biomedical Science Enrichment Program (BSEP). The Goals of the RISE-BSEP Program are to continue providing talented incoming freshmen with the tools to succeed and excel in their freshman and sophomore-level courses and to expose them to biomedical research. The objectives are: a) to provide a summer internship for ten incoming freshman who will participate in developmental activities including Mini-courses in Mathematics, English, College Survival Skills and developing and presenting a Mini-research project, b) to provide an extended internship for BSEP students throughout the academic year so that they can participate in tutoring, supplemental instruction and research.      II) The No-Excuse Research Development Program (NRDP). The goal of the NRDP Program is to continue providing research internships, tutoring, mentoring and developmental activities for EPCC students to increase their success in college as well as their potential to transfer to a four-year university and pursue a Ph.D. degree. The objectives are a) to expose students to biomedical research by providing year-round research internships for fifteen sophomores and selected freshman, b) to provide them with tutoring, mentoring, scientific enhancement and research techniques mini-courses.      III) The Faculty Development Component. The goal is to continue developing the research and teaching potential of RISE faculty so that they become effective advocates of the objectives of the RISE Program. The objectives are: a) to provide adequate release time and resources so that faculty can effectively participate in these activities, b) to provide training and research exposure to increase the ability of the faculty to become more independent researchers, c) to enhance collaborations between EPCC faculty and other institutions, and d) to increase the productivity of the faculty in terms of presentations, publications and grants.      IV) The Community Development Component. The goal is to improve the science literacy of our community so that they become active supporters of the RISE Program. The objectives are: a) to increase the awareness and project a positive image of the importance of biomedical research among community members, and b) to actively engage the community and RISE students and faculty in a ""Community of Science"".      V) The Institutional Development Component. The goal is to improve the research infrastructure of EPCC. The objectives are: a) to renovate a classroom to transform it into an analytical chemical instrumentation laboratory, and b) to provide state-of-the-art computers, multimedia, and small equipment

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.2722083607062088

"INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL STATISTICS Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) promise improved quality of education at reduced cost: they could provide the benefits of one-on-one tutoring without the personnel cost.  However, this potential has not yet been realized.  We propose a new paradigm for intelligent tutoring systems, that addresses a fundamental flaw in traditional approaches.  The outcome of any teaching intervention is uncertain, and the state of the student's knowledge is uncertain.  Our approach explicitly models this uncertainty, providing a more accurate model of the student and enabling the tutoring system to learn fran experience.  We will apply this paradigm to medical statistics education.  Medical practitioners need a good grasp of statistical concepts to read and critique medical literature, plan and carry out projects involving data collection, understand and practice scientific method in research, and make decisions in the face of uncertainty.  However, there is widespread concern that statistics is not being taught effectively to health care professionals.  Biostatistics is difficult to teach in a traditional classroom setting and is widely disliked.  An ITS, providing one-on-one tutoring, could transform biostatistics education.  n/a",INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL STATISTICS,2107956,R43CA065146,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' education evaluation /planning', ' mathematical model', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,1994,80853,0.12549835472702212
"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This project has a sizeable commercialization potential.  Medical schools and university  neuroscience courses from a significant market.  Moreover the technologies to be   developed are transferable to other domains in the natural and social sciences, business  and medicine.  The technologies used are appropriate for use in distance learning programs,  and can be used by individuals to educate themselves.                                                                                     n/a",Educational Tools for Neuroscience,6403961,R43MH065842,"['computer assisted instruction', ' computer simulation', ' educational resource design /development', ' interactive multimedia', ' neurobiology', ' science education']",NIMH,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2001,100000,0.2340488028289509
"Individual Differences in Learning Potential for Language and Literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unacceptably high incidence of poor literacy skills among American young people is a public health crisis that is both insufficiently understood and understudied. Low reading skill in adults is consistently associated with many negative outcomes, including lesser economic success, increased risk of poor mental and physical health, and poor outcomes for offspring (Kutner, et al., 2007; National Institute for Literacy, 2008). There is a growing appreciation that we urgently need to identify the learning mechanisms for those skills that underlie reading comprehension, and to better understand how they fail in low literacy individuals. Our focus is on young adults, but not the predominantly middle class university students who are most often the subjects of reading research in this age range, but a far less restrictive community-based sample obtained from adult education programs, community colleges, organizations that serve young people and from the community at large. Thus, our sample encompasses a wide range of skill levels including many who have or are at risk of dropping out of the educational system after experiencing repeated learning failure. To date there has been remarkably little direct study of learning processes pertaining to literacy skills and the cognitive abilities that make reading comprehension possible. Clarifying the connections between learning capacities and literacy skills is essential for gauging potential for remediation. This project will build on research from our own group and elsewhere showing that poor readers exhibit reliable differences in learning of linguistic and orthographic structure An important innovation of the project is its use of experimental learning tasks to determine connections among capacities for learning in several theoretically important domains of linguistic and orthographic structure. These tasks include probes of (a) learning relationships between sounds of words and word meanings; (b) learning relationships between spellings and word meanings; and critically; (c) learning relationships between sounds and letters; (d) learning for improved efficiency in processing complex syntactic and semantic structures typical of written language. Individual learning profiles derived from the proposed experiments will be related to scores from a comprehensive test battery indexing capacities that are known to differentiate better from less skilled readers within our study population. This will allow us to connect to the existing knowledge base on individual differences in reading comprehension. A second key innovation of the project is to target a large understudied population that is socially and economically important. Whereas most past studies of individual differences in literacy focus on children at early stages of acquisition, our project focuses on older individuals who are products of our primary and secondary schools but who are in many cases unprepared for further education or the demands of the workplace. The prevalence of poor readers in our samples allows us to study the outcomes of atypical developmental trajectories, providing important constraints on current theory. Our research will elucidate mechanisms for the promotion of effective reading skill within this segment of the population. Thus, through improved understanding learner subtypes, this research speaks to the issue of creating more effective learning environments for low-literacy secondary and post-secondary students. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will improve understanding of the potential for remediation in low literacy young adults by clarifying connections between learning capacities and literacy skills in this understudied population. Specifically, four targeted learning procedure are used to gauge individual differences in the capacity to improve knowledge representations and processing efficiency for theoretically motivated aspects of linguistic and orthographic structure ranging from letter and phoneme to word and sentence.

"MUSC Minority Student Development Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students choosing a research career in the biomedical sciences, 2) enhance the quantity and quality of URM students enrolled in the doctoral program in the College of Graduate Studies, 3) prepare them for a successful career in biomedical sciences, 4) provide structured activities that enhance the interaction of minority and majority students and 5) increase the number of URMs in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). To accomplish these goals a Minority Recruitment Committee will be developed to assist in recruiting URMs. An MUSC ""Science Day"" will be implemented to expose minority students to the excitement of biomedical science research. Undergraduate science advisors will nominate potential URM Ph.D. applicants who will attend ""Science Day"" with a parent and the advisor. The SURP will be expanded by five students, designated as E.E. Just Scholars. These SURP participants will interact with minority graduate students via a Big Brother/Sister program. A summer pre-matriculation course to review basic biochemical and molecular concepts will be available for all new students. All students will participate in a ""Diversity in Science"" course that will foster the interaction of minority and majority students that focuses on issues related to minorities in biomedical science. URM graduate students will serve as Graduate Student Ambassadors to HBCUs and present seminars to undergraduates. Funds will be provided for URM graduate students to present their research at a national meeting. A Mentoring Committee will be developed to 1) monitor and advise URM doctoral students through the graduate training program, 2) assist with career development and 3) organize the content of the ""Diversity in Science"" course as well as career workshops. Internal and External Advisory Committees will provide oversight for the program. These programmatic elements will increase the number of minority students participating in biomedical science research and prepare them for a successful career.         n/a",MUSC Minority Student

"MUSC Minority Student Development Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students choosing a research career in the biomedical sciences, 2) enhance the quantity and quality of URM students enrolled in the doctoral program in the College of Graduate Studies, 3) prepare them for a successful career in biomedical sciences, 4) provide structured activities that enhance the interaction of minority and majority students and 5) increase the number of URMs in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). To accomplish these goals a Minority Recruitment Committee will be developed to assist in recruiting URMs. An MUSC ""Science Day"" will be implemented to expose minority students to the excitement of biomedical science research. Undergraduate science advisors will nominate potential URM Ph.D. applicants who will attend ""Science Day"" with a parent and the advisor. The SURP will be expanded by five students, designated as E.E. Just Scholars. These SURP participants will interact with minority graduate students via a Big Brother/Sister program. A summer pre-matriculation course to review basic biochemical and molecular concepts will be available for all new students. All students will participate in a ""Diversity in Science"" course that will foster the interaction of minority and majority students that focuses on issues related to minorities in biomedical science.

"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Multi-media Obesity Prevention Program for Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is recognized as a major public health concern and has become a national health priority. With the prevalence of adolescent obesity nearly triple what it was two decades ago, effective interventions to prevent and treat overweight and obesity among adolescents are needed. Programs to enhance the healthy behaviors related to obesity prevention with cost-effective, science-based and easily deliverable interventions can be effective solutions to help curb the rate of childhood overweight and obesity. The objective of this research is to develop and test a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention for high school students that promotes the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors related to the prevention of obesity. The successful completion of our Phase I project demonstrates that a stage-matched, multi-media expert system is both acceptable to high school students and feasible to conduct in a high school setting. The primary goals of our Phase II application are to complete the development of the expert system intervention and to assess its effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial. Effectiveness will be assessed by comparing fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, TV watching, and several secondary outcome measures among high school students randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition. n/a",Multi-media Obesity Prevention Program for Adolescents,7235383,R44HL074482,[' '],NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2007,144116,0.0783175506342403

With the prevalence of adolescent obesity nearly triple what it was two decades ago, effective interventions to prevent and treat overweight and obesity among adolescents are needed. Programs to enhance the healthy behaviors related to obesity prevention with cost-effective, science-based and easily deliverable interventions can be effective solutions to help curb the rate of childhood overweight and obesity. The objective of this research is to develop and test a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention for high school students that promotes the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors related to the prevention of obesity. The successful completion of our Phase I project demonstrates that a stage-matched, multi-media expert system is both acceptable to high school students and feasible to conduct in a high school setting. The primary goals of our Phase II application are to complete the development of the expert system intervention and to assess its effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial. Effectiveness will be assessed by comparing fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, TV watching, and several secondary outcome measures among high school students randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition. n/a",Multi-media Obesity Prevention Program for Adolescents,6935635,R44HL074482,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'body composition', 'clinical trials', 'diet', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'focus groups', 'health behavior', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'model design /development', 'obesity', 'secondary schools', 'technology /technique development']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2005,711051,0.0783175506342403
"Multiple Behavior Change Internet Program for Colleges DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unhealthy eating, lack of exercise, and poor stress management habits are started in adolescence and have been shown to initiate or promote chronic diseases. Well-designed health promotion programs are needed to assist college students in shaping a foundation of healthy behaviors. This Phase I application proposes the development of a multiple behavior change program for health promotion for college students that can be delivered at low cost over the Internet. As heavy users of the Internet, college students are an ideal population to test the Internet as a health promotion delivery channel. Individualized, interactive, multimedia programs based on the Transtheortetical Model and delivered by colleges to their students will have the potential to produce unprecedented impacts on three of the most risky and costly behaviors, namely diet, exercise and stress management. These programs will be designed to meet the needs of students in each Stage of Change and not just the small minority prepared to take action. Internet based expert system interventions for the three behaviors will be modified and evaluated by consultants, key informants, focus groups, and pilot participants to test the feasibility and acceptability of the programs. n/a",Multiple Behavior Change Internet Program for Colleges,6882792,R43HL074485,"['Internet', 'body physical activity', 'clinical research', 'diet', 'educational resource design /development', 'focus groups', 'health behavior', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'stress management', 'university student']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2005,151525,0.2228332191795044
"Initiative for Maximizing Student Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Since 1993, the University of Miami (UM) and Miami Dade College (MDC) have had a Bridges to the Baccalaureate program. We have stimulated student interest in biomedical research and have helped students transition into the biomedical sciences at UM. We have provided undergraduate research experiences, special courses to improve academic competitiveness, and professional development for community college faculty. But reliable financial support for the students once they come to UM has been wanting.      The IMSD program will remedy this. It will help transitioned students to continue research. Special courses will make them more academically competitive. We also will support graduate students in biomedical research programs with special courses and mentoring. Faculty who mentor these students will improve their skills with IMSD-supported programs. An unbroken skein of intergenerational mentoring is our goal--with undergraduate IMSD Scholars guiding MDC bridge students, predoctoral IMSD Fellows guiding IMSD Scholars, faculty guiding undergraduates and predoctoral fellows, and expert mentors and teachers helping both faculty and fellows.      Our application has six goals and 18 measurable objectives. The overall aim is to increase the number of Bridges students seeking the Ph.D. and to help IMSD fellows become more competitive for postdoctoral and faculty positions. Each year, nine Bridges students who come to UM will be IMSD Scholars for a steady-state of 18. As well, two predoctoral IMSD fellows will be supported for the first two years of graduate work; there will be a steady-state of four fellows. Their dissertation advisers' grants will provide support for them to finish. We will recruit IMSD fellows from among IMSD Scholars and from historically minority serving institutions. IMSD Fellows will be dually mentored by a research adviser and an award-winning educator. Formative and summative evaluation will measure program success.         n/a",Initiative for Maximizing Student Development,7226765,R25GM076419,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator',

"ISMB 2011 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ISMB 2011 Conference Travel Support for Students and Young Scientists.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in 2011 will be held in Vienna, Austria, as a conference of approximately 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and/or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a well organized, well attended, and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to apply what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting comprises parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published research, topically focused special sessions on emerging topics, technology demos, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. As an example, for ISMB 2010, 234 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track; 126 published papers were submitted and 42 selected for the Highlights Track; nine proposals were submitted and four selected for presentation along with two invited for the Special Sessions Track. In all, well over 200 talks were presented during the course of the 2010 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2011. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems. The widespread recognition of bioinformatics has been largely driven by genomic sequence efforts, because laboratory scientists recognize that the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. Biologists are routinely integrating computational tools into their research programs and creating large predictive models based on information found in databases and other electronic resources. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field, as well as exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries.           Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research.

"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling.

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents.

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots.

"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,0.20726738000480502
"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students.

"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,0.22237083065697655
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM.

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning Project​ ​Summary/Abstract  There​ ​is​ ​an​ ​enormous​ ​need​ ​for​ ​qualified​ ​people​ ​to​ ​pursue​ ​careers​ ​in​ ​STEM​ ​(Noonan, 2017).​ ​However,​ ​the​ ​lack​ ​of​ ​a​ ​strong​ ​foundation​ ​in​ ​mathematics​ ​means​ ​students​ ​are​ ​less​ ​likely to​ ​pursue​ ​STEM​ ​majors​ ​and​ ​careers​ ​(Chen,​ ​2013;​ ​Griffith,​ ​2010;​ ​Huang,​ ​Taddese,​ ​&​ ​Walter,​ ​E, 2000;​ ​Kokkelenberg​ ​&​ ​Sinha,​ ​2010;​ ​Lowell​ ​et.​ ​al.,​ ​2009).​ ​Students​ ​from​ ​low-income​ ​families, women,​ ​and​ ​underrepresented​ ​minorities​ ​are​ ​also​ ​less​ ​likely​ ​to​ ​major​ ​in​ ​STEM​ ​(Bettinger,​ ​2010; Griffith,​ ​2010;​ ​Hill,​ ​Corbett​ ​&​ ​Rose,​ ​2010;​ ​Kokkelenberg​ ​&​ ​Sinha,​ ​2010).​ ​Improving​ ​math learning​ ​in​ ​the​ ​elementary​ ​grades​ ​is​ ​important​ ​to​ ​ensure​ ​children​ ​have​ ​the​ ​essential foundational​ ​skills​ ​and​ ​strong​ ​self-efficacy​ ​beliefs​ ​to​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​succeed​ ​with​ ​later​ ​mathematics and​ ​pursue​ ​careers​ ​in​ ​STEM.​ ​With​ ​this​ ​Fast-Track​ ​grant,​ ​​Class​ ​Store​ ​​(​CS​)​,​ ​we​ ​propose​ ​to transform​ ​the​ ​way​ ​in​ ​which​ ​students​ ​learn​ ​​Number​ ​and​ ​Operations​ ​in​ ​Base​ ​Ten.​​ ​​CS​ ​​will​ ​be​ ​​an engaging,​ ​commercially​ ​available,​ ​classroom-based​ ​economy​ ​game​ ​for​ ​tablets​ ​and Chromebooks​ ​that​ ​focuses​ ​on​ ​multi-digit​ ​operations.​ C​​ S​​ ​will​​ ​encourage​ ​conceptual understanding​ ​and​ ​build​ ​math​ ​self-efficacy​ ​for​ ​students​ ​in​ ​grades​ ​K-5​ ​within​ ​the​ ​context​ ​of​ ​a digital,​ ​classroom-based​ ​marketplace.​ ​Within​ ​the​ ​game,​ ​students​ ​will​ ​create​ ​stores,​ ​craft​ ​objects to​ ​sell,​ ​engage​ ​in​ ​selling/purchasing​ ​transactions,​ ​and​ ​work​ ​together​ ​to​ ​increase​ ​the​ ​value​ ​of​ ​the economy.​ ​In​ ​addition,​ ​the​ ​game​ ​will​ ​utilize​ ​​artificial​ ​intelligence​ ​(AI)​ ​to​ ​detect​ ​strategies​ ​students use​ ​and​ ​help​ ​teachers​ ​facilitate​ ​rich​ ​mathematical​ ​discussions​ ​thereby​ ​enhancing​ ​students’ reasoning​ ​skills.  Outcomes.​ ​​The​ ​proposal​ ​will​ ​encourage​ ​three​ ​main​ ​outcomes,​ ​namely:​ ​1)​ ​algorithms​ ​for detecting​ ​math​ ​strategies​ ​students​ ​use,​ ​2)​ ​a​ ​discussion​ ​support​ ​dashboard,​ ​and​ ​3)​ ​algorithms for​ ​predicting​ ​at-risk​ ​status.​ ​A​ ​key​ ​research​ ​aim​ ​is​ ​to​ ​determine​ ​whether​ ​the​ ​software​ ​can​ ​predict math​ ​strategies​ ​students​ ​use​ ​and​ ​detect​ ​which​ ​students​ ​are​ ​at-risk​ ​academically​ ​as​ ​compared to​ ​standardized​ ​assessment​ ​data,​ ​which​ ​will​ ​help​ ​teachers​ ​intervene​ ​appropriately.​ ​The discussion​ ​support​ ​dashboard​ ​will​ ​help​ ​to​ ​promote​ ​rich​ ​mathematical​ ​discussion,​ ​thereby improving​ ​students’​ ​mathematical​ ​justification​ ​and​ ​conceptual​ ​understanding.​ ​The​ ​engaging game​ ​will​ ​bolster​ ​students’​ ​motivation​ ​and​ ​self-efficacy​ ​in​ ​mathematics.  Improving​ ​students’​ ​academic​ ​outcomes​ ​and​ ​self-efficacy​ ​in​ ​base​ ​ten​ ​during​ ​elementary school​ ​will​ ​promote​ ​later​ ​success​ ​in​ ​high​ ​school​ ​mathematics.​ ​Since​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of​ ​advanced math​ ​classes​ ​students​ ​take​ ​is​ ​correlated​ ​with​ ​likelihood​ ​to​ ​complete​ ​a​ ​STEM​ ​degree,​ ​(Chen, 2013)​ ​a​ ​distal​ ​outcome​ ​of​ ​this​ ​proposal​ ​is​ ​increasing​ ​students​ ​pursuing​ ​careers​ ​in​ ​STEM.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9970958,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,750000,0.27600015474089623
