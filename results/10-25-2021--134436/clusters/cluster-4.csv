"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8995710,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prevent', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,0.21330324

"SOFTWARE INTERVENTION FOR ADVANCED SYNTAX DEVELOPMENT Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Remarkably, two thirds of children identified as specific language impaired upon entry into school have neither been identified previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years.  Given this large number of school-age children with previously unidentified language impairments, there is a clear need to develop intervention programs designed specifically to meet the needs of this population, i.e., intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions that are generally missing from the grammar of these children.  We propose to develop language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old). The curriculum will be derived from contemporary linguistics as described by the Principles and Parameters Model of Universal Grammar, which suggests important ways in which the treatment of children with language disrobers may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved.  The software will include an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies.  Our Phase I objective is to develop prototype software for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION Speech-Language pathologists, teachers, and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired and such intervention is mandated by Federal law.  We anticipate that a computer-based intervention system to facilitate advanced language development in school-age children will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individualized services.  n/a",SOFTWARE INTERVENTION FOR ADVANCED SYNTAX DEVELOPMENT,2869503,R43DC004107,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' elementary school', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders', ' middle childhood (6-11)', ' psycholinguistics', ' syntax']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,1999,117327,0.205631768
"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          n/a",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7470513,R01DC005650,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Development', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Habits', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Secondary to', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'implicit memory', 'improved', 'insight', 'lexical', 'motor skill learning', 'novel', 'procedural memory', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,307451,0.196624201

"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9731666,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,736672,0.190398442
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension.

"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9717307,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683541,0.184808755

However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD).

"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics.

"Representations Yielding Task-Dependent Flexibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this research is to advance understanding of the development of cognitive flexibility. Children can show stunning failures to flexibly adapt their behavior to changing circumstances. For example, children often perseverate, repeating prior behaviors when they are no longer appropriate, even in the face of repeated and explicit information to change course. In contrast, mature humans show unique abilities to flexibly adapt their behavior to changing circumstances, even in the absence of explicit information about how or when to do so. Much of the work in the developmental literature has focused on one aspect of this process - children's increasing abilities to actively maintain goals that are provided for them. While this work has led to a rich understanding of the mechanisms supporting children's flexible behaviors, it has largely failed to address two critical transitions in development. First, prior to children's gradual improvements in proactive maintenance of goal representations, they show a qualitatively different, reactive, form of cognitive control, retrieving goals only as they are needed in the moment. Second, even after children excel at maintaining goals that are provided for them to guide exogenous (externally-cued) flexibility, they show continued limitations and developments in endogenous (internally-driven) flexibility, when they must select goals for themselves.  The proposed research builds on a unified, biologically-based computational modeling framework to investigate developments in these diverse components of flexibility, through parallel studies with children and neural network models. This framework focuses on the role of active, abstract knowledge representations in driving transitions from reactive to proactive control, and from exogenous to endogenous control. This work will advance explicit mechanistic models of how children develop, maintain, and update representations in the service of flex- ible behavior, and will inform applications for improving flexibility - from infant search to children's rule use to increasing abilities to drive flexible behavior on one's own.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limitations in cognitive flexibility are particularly salient early in development, late in aging, and in a wide variety of psychopathologies.

"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade.

The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.  n/a",LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT,3315430,R01HD018381,"['child (0-11)', ' child behavior', ' child psychology', ' language development', ' learning', ' speech', ' verbal behavior']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,1988,149470,0.17484821

"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment.

"INTELLIGENT EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION SYSTEM Clinically significant delays in the acquisition of language are the most        prevalent developmental problem in preschool children.

"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as 25% of all children have tics (brief, repetitive movements or noises) at some point, yet individuals have greatly varying prognoses. Even within the first year after tic onset, some children improve and experience no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder (Tourette syndrome: TS) that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict these different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the applicant with the training necessary to transition to independence with a research program focused on the brain mechanisms underlying TS and related disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder: OCD). The applicant's long-term goal is to identify predictive biomarkers that can help guide prognosis and treatment. In order to achieve such goals, the applicant will receive unparalleled mentorship by experts in TS and neuroimaging methodologies (Drs. K. Black, B. Schlaggar, E. Sowell, R. Poldrack, and T. Hershey) and will have access to superb clinical and imaging resources at Washington University. The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to achieve several short-term goals necessary to facilitate her long-term goals, including new training in structural MRI methods, advanced analytic strategies, and longitudinal study design, and continued training in resting state functional connectivity MRI and in the clinical aspects of TS and its comorbid conditions. These training goals will be advanced through the proposed research. First, supervised learning methods will be used to identify patterns of brain structure and function that can classify an individual child as having TS or not, providing a principled starting point for exploring predictive biomarkers (Aim 1). Second, unsupervised learning methods will be used to identify brain-based phenotypic subgroups of TS, helping to better account for the heterogeneity of TS (Aim 2). Finally, supervised learning methods will be used to predict symptom progression for children when they first present with tics, using longitudinal follow-up of children during ther first year after tic onset (Aim 3). Thus, the proposed project is a first step toward brain- based individualized predictions for children with tics. Notably, the proposed methods can be extended to other childhood neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD), setting the stage for early treatment, as well as discovery of the underlying mechanisms. The longitudinal data collected as part of this award will be foundational for future R01 applications targeting the developmental trajectory of TS. The training and research plan proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition to a unique and independent research career in translational developmental neuroscience. With a research program that employs multiple converging techniques and analysis methods to interrogate biomarkers of TS and related disorders, the applicant will continue to address research questions relevant to the NIMH throughout her independent career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Up to 25% of all children have tics (i.e., repetitive, purposeless movements or noises) at some point, yet these individuals have tremendously varying prognoses. Within the first year after tic onset, some children experience marked improvement and no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Therefore, tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome (TS), would benefit highly from individualized predictions. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The proposed project is a first step toward brain-based individualized predictions for children with tics. More generally, the proposed methods may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,9504522,K01MH104592,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Flowcharts', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144559,0.168736238
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as 25% of all children have tics (brief, repetitive movements or noises) at some point, yet individuals have greatly varying prognoses.

Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict these different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the applicant with the training necessary to transition to independence with a research program focused on the brain mechanisms underlying TS and related disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder: OCD). The applicant's long-term goal is to identify predictive biomarkers that can help guide prognosis and treatment. In order to achieve such goals, the applicant will receive unparalleled mentorship by experts in TS and neuroimaging methodologies (Drs. K. Black, B. Schlaggar, E. Sowell, R. Poldrack, and T. Hershey) and will have access to superb clinical and imaging resources at Washington University. The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to achieve several short-term goals necessary to facilitate her long-term goals, including new training in structural MRI methods, advanced analytic strategies, and longitudinal study design, and continued training in resting state functional connectivity MRI and in the clinical aspects of TS and its comorbid conditions. These training goals will be advanced through the proposed research. First, supervised learning methods will be used to identify patterns of brain structure and function that can classify an individual child as having TS or not, providing a principled starting point for exploring predictive biomarkers (Aim 1).

"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9745971,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,78706,0.168252292

Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9923679,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'data enclave', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,83342,0.168252292
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9577420,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,644011,0.16559111

Reading          fluency is necessary for learning from science and social studies texts in           later grades. The objectives of the proposal is to investigate the development       of fluency and automaticity in early elementary school reading. The research         will refine existing programs for the development of fluent reading in               classrooms and remedial reading settings.  The study has three goals: (a) to         develop and validate pedagogical approaches to developing reading fluency,           specifically repeated reading and wide reading approaches; (b) to determine          the effectiveness of approaches to providing remedial support for                    low-achieving children including decoding instruction, speeded word                  identification strategies, and repeated reading strategies; (c) to develop an        empirically-based model of the development of fluency in beginning readers,          particularly obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability aspects of             fluent reading. Strand 1 will train classroom teachers in Fluency-Oriented           Reading Instruction (Stahl, Heubach, & Cramond, 1997) and Wide Reading               approaches in their classrooms in schools in Atlanta, Rural Georgia, and New         Jersey. The development of fluency in children in these classrooms will be           measured through standardized and experimental methods both immediately              following the intervention and a year later, and these children will be              compared to the development of fluency in children receiving a traditional           reading instruction. Effective methods will be implemented and disseminated.         Strand 2 will examine remedial aspects of reading instruction designed to            promote the development of fluent and automatic reading in struggling readers.       This strand will examine the effectiveness of both Phonological and Strategy         Training, Speeded Word Retrieval, and Repeated Reading strategies, both singly       and in combination. The effectiveness of these will be compared to a                 traditional remedial instruction control. Both immediate and long term               follow-up measures, on both standardized achievement and experimental                measures, will be conducted to follow the progress of these children. Strand 3       will examine how the aspects associated with automatic reading:                      obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability change together during the          development of fluent reading during the second grade.

"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy 1 Project Summary  2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur-  3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing  4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000  5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most  6 common impairments is equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed  7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP  8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention  9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access 14 to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the 15 quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families. Specific Aims are 16 Aim 1. Develop working prototype of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 17 MS1: Veristride will optimize sensor selection and placement; construct prototype data acquisition hardware, 18 firmware and software. Months 1-2. 19 Aim 2. Iteratively design HEART-Gait system: Milestones are: 20 MS2: Veristride and the Spaulding team will work closely to modify the prototype system to make it suitable for 21 monitoring toe-walking in children with CP. Months 2-5. 22 MS3: The Spaulding team will interview 10 clinicians (unaffiliated with the project) and 10 families (guardians 23 and children) to gather their feedback about the HEART-Gait system. Months 2-5. 24 Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 25 MS4: The Spaulding team will recruit 20 children (5-12 years) with CP and toe-walking pattern. Data will be 26 collected simultaneously from HEART-Gait and camera-based motion capture. Months 5-10. 27 MS5. The Spaulding team will derive a clinical index of the severity of toe-walking based on ankle biomechan- 28 ics data collected using the camera-based motion capture system. Months 6-11. 29 MS6. Veristride will collaborate with Spaulding team to develop machine-learning algorithms to estimate toe- 30 walking severity and characterize accuracy. Months 7-12. 31 Narrative Equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, is commonly observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP), and can be treated by a variety of treatments. This SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful outcomes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing.

"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%.

"The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention Project Summary This project proposes to leverage innovative data collected as part of a large, ongoing, cluster randomized trial of therapies to arrest and prevent dental caries in low-income, minority children to (1) investigate the potential microbial determinants of oral health inequities across racial/ethnic children and (2) explore the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions for caries. Over the past ten years, we have conducted multiple studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of preventive treatments for dental caries applied in pragmatic settings across the United States. In each study, an average of 30% of children was observed to have untreated decay at baseline, a prevalence which was consistently higher amongst minority children. Following receipt of therapeutic interventions for caries prevention and observed longitudinally, some children stayed caries free (responders) while others experienced new incidence of tooth decay (non-responders). This phenomenon of resistance and susceptibility to caries occurred in children with or without prior caries experience, was found amongst children living in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities, and was not related to sex or age. In total, re-occurrence of dental caries following preventive therapies was observed in approximately 15% of children regardless of prior caries. Our intention is to study these phenomena. We propose to collect new data from the oral microbiome in a cohort of children receiving biannual silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for dental caries, as well as data on key confounders including dietary intake and oral hygiene behavior. This new data will be linked to data collected from clinical examinations and participant demographics. Children identified for this study will be participants in the referenced clinical trial. Uncovering the role of the microbiome in health disparities could enhance our understanding of why some populations have poorer success rates, greater severity of disease, or overall elevated disease risks compared to others. Our primary goals are to (1) utilize microbiome sequence analysis and taxonomic assignment to identify the potential microbiota and metabolites of caries that exist within different racial/ethnic groups with and without untreated caries, (2) compare the distribution of these microbiota prior to and following receipt of silver diamine fluoride to arrest and prevent caries, and (3) develop a predictive model of responsiveness to SDF using artificial neural networks and LASSO/elastic nets. This will be the first study to longitudinally examine the microbial determinants of innate caries susceptibility and resistance to traditional preventive therapies. Results may improve the precision, targeting, and impact of caries prevention programs. Project Narrative This project focuses on (1) the microbiota determinants of oral health inequities in US children and (2) the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions to arrest and prevent dental caries. Using data from an ongoing, large scale, cluster randomized trial of preventive therapies for caries, we will collect additional data from the oral microbiome to explore disparities in untreated caries across racial/ethnic groups, compare the distribution of relevant microbiota and their metabolites in children with and without caries before and after receipt of silver diamine fluoride, and generate a predictive model to predict whether children are more or less susceptible to the effects of traditional preventive therapies.

"Early Language Intervention via the Internet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test an Internet-based language intervention system designed to promote language development in preschool children with language disorders. Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support.

"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,9958698,R21AI151730,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Amoxicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Azithromycin', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Clavulanate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Otitis Media', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Pattern', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'clinical care', 'colonization resistance', 'design', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'fecal microbiome', 'genetic variant', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'insight', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled study', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'stool sample', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment group']",NIAID,"J.

"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law.

"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions.

"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers.

"Parent-Level Predictors of Early Language Interaction Quality and Intervention Outcomes Abstract  Children with poor early language skills are at risk for academic, social, vocational, and health challenges across the lifespan (Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2008; Conti-Ramsden, Durkin, Toseeb, Botting, & Pickles, 2017; Norbury & Sonuga-Barke, 2017; Pace, Alper, Burchinal, Golinkoff, & Hirsh-Pasek, 2019). This at-risk group includes approximately 1.6 million children under five with primary developmental language disorder (DLD) and 300,500 children with DLD and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD+DLD; Bishop, 2010; Norbury & Sonuga-Barke, 2017; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b; Xu, Strathearn, Liu, & Bao, 2018). Parent-implemented early language intervention is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue. However, these interventions yield large individual differences in outcomes and limited scalability (Roberts & Kaiser, 2011). Variable intervention effectiveness could result from many factors including parent-level differences in language skills and behavioral awareness. Despite differences in interaction quality across parents (Hirsh- Pasek et al., 2015), and potential heritable components of language disorder (Bishop, 2009), there has been little to no exploration of the role of these parent-level factors in early language interaction and intervention.  This project will address this critical gap in the evidence. Parents' language skills will be examined in relationship to the quality of parent–child language interactions (Aim1). Furthermore, this research will explore whether parents' behavioral awareness predicts their modifiability after brief training (Aim 2). Finally, predictors of early language interaction quality and modifiability will be compared in dyads with typically developing children, children with primary DLD, and with ASD+DLD (Aim 3). The long-term goal of this research program is to increase intervention effectiveness and improve child outcomes by extending the social-interactionist framework to scaffold parents. Differences between the DLD and ASD+DLD groups could inform disorder- specific intervention recommendations. Behavioral data will be collected from three groups of parent-child dyads—children with primary DLD (Aim 1,2,&3), children with ASD+DLD (Aim 3), and age-matched controls (Aim 1,2,&3). Inter- and intra-group analyses will be conducted to explore the relationships between parent- level factors, the quality of parent–child interaction, and parent modifiability following parent training.  These aims will support the long-term career development goal of improving the language, academic, and health outcomes of at-risk children through family-centered early language intervention research. Three specific areas of career development have also been identified: 1) examining individual-level factors that impact early language interaction and intervention outcomes, 2) applying family-centered intervention to specific disorder groups, and 3) analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. The career development will take place at an R1 university with support from an accomplished, inter-disciplinary mentorship team. Project Narrative Children with poor early language skills are at risk for academic, social, vocational, and health difficulties across the lifespan. Parent training—as part of early language intervention—is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue, but these interventions demonstrate large individual differences in outcomes and barriers to scalability. The purpose of this research is to examine parent-level predictors of early language interaction quality and modifiability during training, which will help increase intervention effectiveness.",Parent-Level Predictors of Early Language Interaction Quality and Intervention Outcomes,9892663,K23DC017763,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Code', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fibrinogen', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Problem Solving', 'Proliferating', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'career development', 'constructivism', 'cost effective', 'dosage', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'language training', 'multilevel analysis', 'parental role', 'peer', 'programs', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'social', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'trend']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2020,162602,0.153552263

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain.

"Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use; (2) To improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating additional sensor technologies; (3) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post-surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a validation study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 and 3 focus on improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, and relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology,9324456,R56HL131574,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'technology/technique', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2016,277123,0.150702951
"Representations Yielding Task-Dependent Flexibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this research is to advance understanding of the development of cognitive flexibility. Children can show stunning failures to flexibly adapt their behavior to changing circumstances. For example, children often perseverate, repeating prior behaviors when they are no longer appropriate, even in the face of repeated and explicit information to change course. In contrast, mature humans show unique abilities to flexibly adapt their behavior to changing circumstances, even in the absence of explicit information about how or when to do so. Much of the work in the developmental literature has focused on one aspect of this process - children's increasing abilities to actively maintain goals that are provided for them. While this work has led to a rich understanding of the mechanisms supporting children's flexible behaviors, it has largely failed to address two critical transitions in development. First, prior to children's gradual improvements in proactive maintenance of goal representations, they show a qualitatively different, reactive, form of cognitive control, retrieving goals only as they are needed in the moment. Second, even after children excel at maintaining goals that are provided for them to guide exogenous (externally-cued) flexibility, they show continued limitations and developments in endogenous (internally-driven) flexibility, when they must select goals for themselves.  The proposed research builds on a unified, biologically-based computational modeling framework to investigate developments in these diverse components of flexibility, through parallel studies with children and neural network models. This framework focuses on the role of active, abstract knowledge representations in driving transitions from reactive to proactive control, and from exogenous to endogenous control. This work will advance explicit mechanistic models of how children develop, maintain, and update representations in the service of flex- ible behavior, and will inform applications for improving flexibility - from infant search to children's rule use to increasing abilities to drive flexible behavior on one's own.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limitations in cognitive flexibility are particularly salient early in development, late in aging, and in a wide variety of psychopathologies. They can lead to serious impairments in learning, decision-making, and action. Understanding the basis for such limitations and subsequent developments in cognitive flexibility is thus a central goal for basic science, mental health, and education.

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS This application is being submitted to PA-18-591 in accordance with NOT-OD-18-194. The proposed supplement INCLUDE project is entitled: “Upper Airway Structure and Function and Risk for OSA in Children with Down Syndrome”. The project is within the scope of R01 HL130468 entitled: “A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS” that focuses on implementing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1A) using analytical and machine learning techniques to determine the static (3D) and dynamic (4D) architecture and tissue characteristics of the upper airway in wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1B). These methods are coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Aim 2A) and biomechanical modeling (Aim 2B) to establish the biomechanical basis of OSAS in children with obesity. The parent grant also evaluates the impact of treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on airway mechanics (Aim 3A) and the clinical utility of image-based airway mechanical parameters in OSAS (Aim 3B). The tools and methodologies used in the parent project will be integrated in all Aims of this INCLUDE project. The proposed project addresses 2 important IC-specific priorities of NHLBI: 1) “Incorporation of individuals with Down syndrome into existing disease cohorts and clinical trials directed toward sleep apnea. This could include collection of tissue or blood specimens and -omics data generation and analysis, imaging, and computational modeling”, 2) Identification of potential risk and resilience factors that make individuals with Down syndrome susceptible to transient or persistent blood disorders and congenital heart disease”. The problem: Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of developmental disability and mental retardation with an incidence of 1/800 live births (1). The prevalence of OSA in these children is very high and estimated between 50-95% (2-5), and much higher than the 1-4% prevalence in the general pediatric population (6). OSA has detrimental consequences in children, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive effects (6). This is particularly true for children with Down syndrome who are already predisposed to congenital heart anomalies and developmental delay. Therefore, the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the need to screen for OSA within the first 6 months of life in all children with Down syndrome and continue to evaluate for the disorder on all medical encounters thereafter throughout childhood (7). Anatomical factors related to the Down syndrome phenotype have been attributed to the causation of OSA in this group. These include midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia (8-11), enlarged tongue (12, 13), adenoid and tonsilar hypertrophy (13, 14), laryngo-tracheal anomalies (15), and obesity (16-19). In addition, reduced neuromuscular tone has been suspected of having a role in the development of OSA in these subjects (3). Traditional methods to evaluate the upper airway in children with DS include plain lateral neck radiograph, cephalometric measurements, airway fluoroscopy, and nasal pharyngoscopy (8, 15, 20, 21). However, these methods provide only limited information regarding the entire upper airway structure. During the years our group has developed,applied, and published seminal work on the upper airway structure and function of children using MRI methodology (22-35). This body of work on normal children and children with craniofacial abnormalities including DS created a large MRI database that is the basis for the current proposal. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9772627,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Airway Resistance', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neck', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'shear stress', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,420407,0.146872665
"SOFTWARE FOR VERB BASED EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION Delays in language acquisition are the most prevalent developmental problem      in preschool children.  The acquisition of verbs poses a special challenge       for children with language problems, perhaps because verbs are richly            endowed with syntactic and semantic information and play a central role in       the development of grammatical competency.  We plan to develop and publish       a microcomputer-based system designed to facilitate the development of a         rich verb lexicon in children at risk for chronic language disorders.  The       curriculum will be based on linguistic research indicating a central role        for verbs in language acquisition.  The system will feature animation,           digital speech, interface options for special needs, and an intelligent          computer-aided training (JCAT) system that uses artificial intelligence to       generate individualized intervention strategies.  The system will include        modules designed to increase the size and diversity of the verb lexicon,         increase semantic and syntactic accuracy, and promote the proper use of          inflected verb forms.  Our Phase II objectives are to (a) develop                additional program modules for children at various stages of language            development, (b) field test, improve, and validate the effectiveness of          program components, and (c) integrate all components with the ICAT system.       We envision the system being useful in clinical, school, and preschool           settings, as well as in the home.                                                                                                                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Speech-Language Pathologists, teachers         and parents recognize athe importance of early intervention when a child's       language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal        law.  Our proposal is to produce a clinically effective language                 intervention system that will be a commercial success because it provides        a cost effective means to supplement the efforts of professional service         providers, and can fulfill an urgent and largely unmet need for intensive,       individualized early language intervention.                                       n/a",SOFTWARE FOR VERB BASED EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION,2403648,R44HD035255,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' education evaluation /planning', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders']",NICHD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,1997,324379,0.146111476
"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,0.145653975
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings.

"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis.

"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10072546,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,580988,0.142412568
"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9989761,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,135454,0.141636529

"Exposing the Deep Content of the Publication: Knowledge Extraction for Neuroimaging in Child Psychiatry Abstract Numerous psychiatric disorders can plague the development of children. Each of these disorders manifests as a distinct pattern of clinical, behavioral, etiological, neuroanatomic, and neurofunctional characteristics that challenge the management of the individual patient, as well as the development of successful intervention and prevention strategies. In the area of neuroimaging, a substantial number of studies have been performed and published in the literature; while each study produces a wealth a clinical and imaging data, most of the detailed knowledge information in the manuscript (detailed findings, methods, raw and derived data, etc.) remains an untapped resource due to limitations of the current publication format related to standards of human and machine-readable knowledge expression. Following upon the successful development of numerous data sharing resources and mandates, this proposal seeks to develop the tools necessary to liberate the detailed knowledge expressions form the publication, enhance our ability to query, drive inference and act upon these published knowledge elements via the Child Psychiatry Portal, and embark on a research plan that highlights the utility of these combined data resources to solve specific problems in the child psychiatry domain related to reproducibility of findings and amplification of RDoC constructs. Successful execution of this program of social, technical and biological study will move the field forward by providing additional methods for all investigators to fulfill their NIH obligation to participate in open, reproducible science. As such, this fosters a bolder ‘discovery- mode’ data interrogation designed to capture the richness of the neuroimaging data landscape and provide better directed hypotheses for future study into diagnosis, prediction, monitoring of therapeutic intervention.

"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9352674,F31DC015370,"['Adult', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'comprehension deficit', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'farmer', 'improved', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language impairment', 'natural language', 'novel', 'peer', 'social', 'sound', 'syntax', 'teacher', 'therapy design']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2017,24909,0.132256434

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience.

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.

"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10058660,R01HD101842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Children', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Learning Disorders', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disabilities', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active control', 'base', 'boys', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'functional disability', 'girls', 'intervention effect', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,688574,0.128681095
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults.

"EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION VIA THE INTERNET Language delay is pervasive among preschool children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative, yet research shows that most preschoolers do not receive language intervention services. We propose to develop an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in three to five-year-old children with language function in the range of 24 to 42 months. The curricular design will be based on contemporary linguistic research. On-line delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks ongoing performance. By combining Internet accessibility with centralized curricular control and data collection, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies. It will also be possible to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. Our Phase I goal is to test the feasibility and technical merit of our plans. A prototype internet-based language intervention system will be developed and placed on- line in an Early Essential Education classroom, and students with language delays will be given an opportunity to use the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers, and parents recognize the importance of early intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and Federal law mandates such intervention. We anticipate that a highly accessible Internet-based language intervention system for three to five year olds will fulfill an unmet need for individualized services and will be a commercial success.  n/a",EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION VIA THE INTERNET,6142025,R43DC004487,"['Internet', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' curriculum', ' early experience', ' educational resource design /development', ' elementary school', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders', ' online computer', ' preschool child (1-5)']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,117683,0.12561673
"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics and specific Challenge Topic, 08-AR-101: Genotyping of Existing Cohorts in Rheumatic, Skin, and Musculoskeletal Diseases. These studies will utilize existing clinical cohorts to create a broadly shared data resource that is currently missing in this important disease area and we will make this resource available to all researchers. The immediate result of the work will be submission of a large genotype-phenotype dataset, consisting of >3,000 cases of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), to the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). This database will allow our collaborative working group and others to pursue analytical projects that will identify genetic loci contributing to disease risk. The datasets will also provide access to results derived from our own new methodological analytical approaches aimed at the identification of genetic risk factors for JIA. JIA is the #1 cause of acquired disability in children, afflicting one in every one thousand children. Recent reports, including our own, have identified genetic variants common to multiple subtypes of inflammatory arthritis (e.g., seropositive adult rheumatoid arthritis, systemic JIA, polyarticular JIA). These genes could represent ""master switches"" predisposing to arthritis in general, in concert with other genes that contribute to phenotypic subtype. This project seeks to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of JIA by genotyping a large well-phenotyped population. Accordingly, in Stage 1 of our Specific Aim, we propose to define JIA candidate regions with evidence for association in a discovery cohort of 1,500 JIA cases recruited from the greater Philadelphia area and collaborating international centers. Approximately 50% of this cohort is already genotyped and this funding will enable us to augment this dataset by whole genome-wide association (GWA) analyses of over 700 additional samples (all of which are already in-hand), using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based design to track 600,000 potential polymorphisms. In Stage 2, we will replicate our findings by selective genotyping of an additional 1,000 existing samples from well-phenotyped JIA cases recruited to other collaborating sites. This database will be leveraged against matched samples from a collection of over 8,000 genotyped controls, from which we expect at least 4,000 to be a perfect match. We hypothesize that the association of genome-wide individual SNPs, SNP haplotypes, or CNVs with JIA will identify candidate risk genes and structural variants that predispose to JIA.

"Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH Project Summary/Abstract Acute gastroenteritis (AGE)--infectious diarrhea—is a common condition that is costly in the US and high- mortality in developing nations. The cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapy (ORT), an evidence-based technique that has saved over 54 million lives in the 50 years since its introduction. The problem we aim to address is ORT’s underuse in developed countries—specifically in the home setting. If widely adopted, ORT could reduce 80% of AGE-related healthcare visits and costs among children, eliminating 1.3 million emergency department visits and $1.5 billion in hospital costs annually. The product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health application (app)--ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the home. ORCAH's innovation is in the use of the mobile device's native functions for analytics, database parameters, timers, notifications, and process state—for a novel aim: making ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countries. We hypothesize we will achieve an effectiveness (percentage of ORT tasks completed) of 80%. We will achieve our objective through 3 Aims: Aim 1. Use key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjects’ prioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a user- centered design interface, and thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAH. Aim 2. Perform cycles of iterative, user-centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app’s usability. Aim 3. Pilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methods. Based on the impact of ORT in developing settings, the gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countries, and the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problem, we expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability-optimized, effective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visits. Objectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH’s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud-based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient- generated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosing. The long-term goals are to further develop the machine-learning functionalities to update best practices for ORT, and to develop ORCAH for developing settings. The market for ORCAH—caregivers of children with AGE—represents a promising commercial potential, as about 57.9 million children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at least 24 hours duration. Data2Care’s commercialization strategy includes direct business-to-consumer marketing, as well as co-marketing with business partners including after-hours advice centers, rehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers. Project Narrative  Acute gastroenteritis—infectious diarrhea—is a high-mortality condition in developing nations, where a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has saved over 54 million lives and is considered the cornerstone of management; however, ORT is underused in developed nations including the United States, resulting in an estimated excess of 1.3 million emergency department visits by children and $1.5 billion in hospital costs for children annually. Through developing a mobile health application—ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household setting, we expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visits, and the associated costs. In the long term, through adding a cloud-based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient-generated data, we expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the science, delivery and efficacy of ORT.",Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH,9906781,R41HD101158,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Fostering', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Visit', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Notification', 'Oral', 'Oral Rehydration Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'User-Computer Interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"DATA2CARE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R41,2019,145682,0.125066531
"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school.

"LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms. Project Summary / Abstract ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood, affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings. LemurDx is a concept for a software system for smartwatches and mobile tablets, optimized for clinical use, that uses state-of-the-art, yet relatively low-cost, sensor technology to measure hyperactivity, with the clinical goal of differentiating children with ADHD-hyperactive presentation or ADHD combined presentation from children with typical levels of activity. LemurDx will passively collect data from smartwatch sensors. Clinicians will ask a child to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx application for one day and then collect the de-identified data. The data will be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant secure server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to differentiate children with clinical levels of hyperactivity from those with typical levels of activity, providing clinicians with immediate results. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number of ways. Along with the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors (many of which are not available on actigraphy devices) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the team is carefully designing a complete system based on the unique needs of clinicians. This includes a comprehensive system of secure HIPAA-compliant servers, automated state-of-the- art ML algorithms, pre-programmed mobile tablets and smartwatches for clinical use, a secure and de- identified data architecture, and a simple user interface that eliminates any technological burden on clinicians. Aim 1 of the project is to develop a commercial grade prototype of LemurDx following principles of user- centered design, with feedback from focus groups including children, parents, and clinicians. Aim 2 of the project is to test the feasibility of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from 30 children (ages 6-11) who will wear a smartwatch with LemurDx technology for one day. Aim 3 of the project is to test and refine several ML algorithms to achieve a high level of sensitivity and specificity to accurately classify children with and without ADHD. LemurDx is significant as there is no objective and commercially available measure of hyperactivity to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, despite a great need in settings including pediatric primary-care practices, children’s hospitals, and behavioral health clinics. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure, “that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Innovations include a combination of reliable, inexpensive measurement technology combined with accurate ML algorithms to consistently and objectively measure hyperactivity in a system that is designed for clinical users. We will show that LemurDx has commercialization potential by demonstrating accuracy, cost effectiveness, and user adherence, and will lay the foundation for the development of a scalable clinical delivery system. Project Narrative ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood affecting around 5% of all American children.

"Quantifying Children's Emotions with the Emotion Intensity-Linkage Function Model    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tantrums are a near universal and highly salient feature of emotional development. From parents' perspective, they are among the most commonly reported childhood behavioral problems. From a psychopathological perspective, tantrums persisting to age 8 predict future antisocial behavior. Scientifically, tantrums are a window onto emotions so intense as to be otherwise inaccessible to observation. Our goal in this study is to complete a quantitative, behaviorally based model of the emotional/behavioral processes comprising tantrums. Our previous factor analyses and multidimensional scaling converged to show that tantrums are composed of two independent but temporally overlapping emotional/ behavioral processes, Anger and Distress. Anger is associated with specific behaviors that are ordered by intensity, e.g., low anger is associated with stamping and high anger with screaming. We have already successfully modeled the rise and fall of tantrum anger as a Beta function and its control of the behaviors that express it as logit- polynomial ""linkage functions."" In this study, we will incorporate Distress behaviors (crying, whining, dropping down, comfort seeking) into a 2 variable, Emotion Intensity-Behavioral Linkage Function (EI- BLF) model that will specify the influence of each emotion on the set of tantrum behaviors. The model will also include the effects of parental intervention on children's emotions. An already developed methodology for audio/video recording of in-home tantrums will provide new, more temporally precise data for the acoustic spectral analyses of tantrum vocalizations, FACs coding of facial expression, and GEE statistical techniques used to construct the model. This work will improve the understanding of the escalation, regulation and socialization of anger; inform social information processing models of aggression; and benefit clinical research, diagnosis and treatment by scaling the intensity of anger associated with various angry behaviors. More generally, the EI-BLF model will help define the relationship between emotions and their behavioral expression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will complete the Emotion Intensity-Behavioral Linkage Function model of anger and sadness in children's tantrums.

"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,9032506,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,373707,0.112216109

"GENERIC CONTROLLER FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) Many developmentally disabled children are dependent on assistive devices to help them control their external environments (appliances, tools, etc.). Devices presently available are limiting in that these devices are designed conservatively to accommodate any developmentally disabled individual.  Unfortunately, for those children that could control more of their environment, these devices are frustrating due to the limitations that they impose.  A device is needed that is generic enough to allow these more capable children to control their environments, while still allowing more severely disabled individuals to control their environments, too.  DVP, Inc. proposes to develop such an environment controller that is driven by real-time hand motions from the users.  As motion can be relatively simple or complex, the device will be suitable for interfacing with developmentally disabled children with varying degrees of cognitive and physical disabilities.  JULY 1990  The device will be programmable in that each child will develop his/her own set of motion-based commands to control the environment.  As such, the device characteristics will be different for each individual, but the same device can be used across a wide variety of children for a variety of applications.  By interfacing the interpreted motions with devices in the children's environments, these children will have a level of control that was not previously available.  n/a",GENERIC CONTROLLER FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED,3499880,R43HD027771,"['artificial intelligence', ' assistive device /technology', ' biomedical equipment development', ' child with disability', ' cognition disorders', ' computer human interaction', ' ergonomics', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' person with disability', ' robotics']",NICHD,"DVP, INC.",R43,1991,50000,0.111299106
"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher. The aggregate results of this work will inform development of a predictive model for sedation-analgesia dose response for critically ill children that will be the focus of future, prospective investigations",A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children,9976096,K23HD099331,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Continuous Infusion', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dependence', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genotyped patients', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mathematical model', 'medication administration', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient response', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'routine care', 'sedative', 'self-directed learning', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,161755,0.111161404
"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,0.11035874

"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown.

In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,9883359,R01GM108618,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adenoviruses', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibiotics', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Hemorrhage', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Home environment', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'IV Fluid', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Liver Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrophage activation syndrome', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precision medicine trial', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'exome', 'fighting', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'science education', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,537434,0.105263704
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke).

"Promoting Use of Effective Early Intervention Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now strong scientific support for the widespread implementation of proven, effective early intervention programs for young children with, or at risk for, developmental disability. However, in practice, programs that lack demonstrated effectiveness are often implemented, undermining the impact of early intervention. The long-term goal of the current project is to increase the likelihood that children ages 0-5 years with or at risk for developmental disability receive effective intervention services. To this end, the specific aims of the proposed Phase II work will be to fully develop and make ready for commercial dissemination three products for which prototypes already exist from R&D completed in Phase I and from prior successful Sociometrics products. The central product is the Early Intervention Program Archive to Reduce Developmental Disability (EIPARDD), which will consist of complete replication kits of all necessary materials (e.g., manuals, workbooks) to implement and evaluate an empirically-supported intervention. Interventions included in EIPARDD were identified through a comprehensive scientific literature search and extensive evaluation by an independent Expert Panel in Phase I. Access to 12 empirically-supported intervention programs was secured in Phase I, and a prototype kit for one EIPARDD program was constructed and favorably evaluated by consumers. The specific aim for Phase II is to make all materials for each program in EIPARDD ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period. The other two products enhance the use of EIPARDD by (1) facilitating the selection of the appropriate empirically-supported intervention program for a given need (including those not available as replication kits), through an online Early Intervention Program Selection Resource; and (2) promoting program fidelity and evaluation through a set of Early Intervention Program Implementation and Evaluation Tutorials that offer generalized and program- tailored implementation and evaluation information in online and USB flash drive formats. Specific Phase II aims are to make these two ancillary products ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period. Technical usability testing and consumer feedback will be used extensively throughout the process to ensure that all final products meet the needs of early intervention professionals. In addition, a mixed-method research study will be conducted to investigate the fidelity of implementing effective early intervention programs in new sites. The replication kits will be marketed to early intervention decision-makers at local, state and regional levels. The commercial market for these products is substantial with over 102,000 professionals working in early intervention under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Parts B and C, serving nearly one million children ages 0-5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The EIPARDD and its associated products will promote public health in two key ways. It will: (1) offer more young children with or at risk of developmental delay and their families efficacious early intervention services, by providing EI decision-makers with an array of efficacious EI programs from which to easily and affordably select, implement, adapt, and evaluate their efforts as they deliver EI services, and (2) prepare current and aspiring EI specialists about effective EI programs for children with or at risk of developmental delays by offering early childhood faculty and trainers accessible and interactive research-based information for use in pre-service preparation, staff orientation, staff training. More widespread use, adaptation, and evaluation of efficacious EI programs for children with or at risk for developmental delay, and more highly skilled EI professionals, should be the result.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The EIPARDD and its associated products will promote public health in two key ways.

"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation. But what if a system could identify absences due to illnesses and collect data on the symptoms causing the illness-related absences? Such a system might well offer an early, highly specific signal of an illness in a population, allowing public and school health officials to detect outbreaks in schools very early in their course. We propose to develop a VoiceXML speech processing system that can accurately capture during a brief telephone interview the symptoms a person is experiencing that are causing an absence. We propose to modify the ""work processes"" school districts use to have parents or guardians report that their children will be absent from school. Parents will use the interactive voice response questionnaire (or a web site, if they prefer) to report (on a voluntary basis) the symptoms that are causing the child's absence. We believe that monitoring of reports of such symptoms could both protect the health of children from bioterrorist attacks and from toxins in the environment. It could also improve their health on a daily basis by helping school nurses identify children with poorly managed chronic illnesses, and recognize and manage the routine outbreaks of infectious diseases that occur each year. The study plan focuses on creation of a computer telephone interviewing system and a formative evaluation that will include both qualitative and quantitative components and will assess the feasibility, validity, and potential usefulness of the system.             n/a",Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health,7497109,R21EB007466,"['Absenteeism', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Bioterrorism', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computers', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Education', 'Educational Materials', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Head Nurses', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nausea', 'Nursing Schools', 'Occupational Health Nursing', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Primary Schools', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Questionnaires', 'Readiness', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Terrorism', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high school', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'school health', 'social', 'speech processing', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'voice recognition']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2008,189263,0.099098264

"Dx Ear: An automated tool for diagnosis of otitis media    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Otitis media is a general term for middle-ear inflammation that is classified clinically as either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM represents a bacterial super infection of the middle ear fluid and OME a sterile effusion that tends to subside spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally beneficial only for AOM. Accurate diagnosis of AOM, as well as distinction from both OME and no effusion (NOE) requires considerable training.  AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed for children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media.1 AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media.2 Given these considerations, our goal is to:  Develop a software tool to classify images into one of three stringent clinical diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE), and validate the algorithm on tympanic membrane (TM) images.  We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team that can successfully develop an automated diagnostic algorithm in this Phase-I program. We have (1) gathered a team of nationally-recognized otoscopists with substantial clinical and research experience in the context of AOM clinical trials; (2) studied the predictive value of diagnostic findings in discriminating AOM from OME from NOE; (3) acquired a large number of TM images from children; and (4) involved an internationally recognized expert in developing algorithms in all areas of image analysis and processing.  In the planned Phase-II, we will use the algorithm developed in the Phase-I program and incorporate it into a user-friendly and marketable digital otoscope-software platform that can be used at the point-of-care by clinicians to improve the care of children with this frequently occurring condition. This will be followed by a clinical trial evaluating its immediate impact on clinical care, and, in particular, utilization of antimicrobials.  Our main goal will be to develop an accurate automated algorithm for classifying the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We aim to achieve an overall accuracy of 95 percent by applying a newly developed classification algorithm. This will include applying state-of-the-art classification methods as well as segmentation algorithms, for automated, robust diagnosis and classification of the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We propose to achieve this through the following two specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a robust and accurate diagnostic algorithm that can discriminate TM digital images into 1of 3 stringent diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE).  Specific Aim 2: Validate the algorithm on a dataset that includes over 2000 TM images collected in a recently completed NIAID-sponsored clinical trial.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media. AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media. Developing an automated and accurate software tool to help classify otitis media images into one of three stringent clinical categories would have a great impact on both clinical care as well as reducing the unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics in the US.              NARRATIVE AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US.

"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD",10054894,K23MH121650,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional disorder', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'atomoxetine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'sustained attention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational clinical trial', 'treatment response']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.097100458
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families PROJECT SUMMARY Early childhood obesity continues to be a clinical and public health challenge in the United States; almost a third of children ages 2-to-5 years old are either overweight or obese. Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely than normal weight children to be overweight/obese as adults. Non- Hispanic blacks (NHB) have double and Hispanics have triple the rates of obesity compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Asians (10.4%,15.6%, 5.2%, and 5.0%, respectively). Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood. Thus, preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce the health care costs associated with obesity- related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that pregnancy, infancy and early childhood may be critical time periods in the development of overweight/obesity throughout the lifespan but many knowledge gaps remain. These gaps include understanding factors that contribute to high risk for excessive weight gain during gestation, infancy and early childhood which may also partially explain differential response to intervention strategies. Moreover, risk for the development of overweight and obesity during these critical developmental periods appear to be increased in children from racial and ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but there is a paucity of studies in the literature that include these groups. To better understand how early life factors impact the onset of childhood obesity by age 5, this study will utilize data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in Miami Dade County (MDC), Florida. Specifically, we will examine the relationship between pregnancy (maternal weight, gestational diabetes, smoking, alcohol/substance use) and early life (initiation, exclusive and duration of breastfeeding, time of introduction to solid food) risk/ protective factors and child body mass index percentile and z score at age 5. Covariates include mother's race/ethnicity, education level and household income. Statistical models will be evaluated using machine learning-cross validation techniques. This approach has not been previously applied to the obesity science to examine pregnancy and early life obesity risk/protective factors. The analyses take advantage of a robust secondary data set that is arguably one of the most diverse in the country; the WIC program currently services almost half of the nation's mothers babies and young children (as does the local program for MDC) who are from predominantly low income and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The findings from this study will inform the development of obesity prevention interventions targeting pregnancy, prenatal and early childhood developmental periods. Project Narrative The proposed research will increase the understanding of pregnancy and early life obesity risk factors and how these factors vary by ethnic group in low income families, addressing a critical gap in the literature. This study will utilize machine learning-cross validation techniques to ensure the external reliability and validity of our statistical models. Study results generated here will inform the development and delivery of pregnancy and early life obesity prevention interventions and actionable recommendations for pediatric and family clinical care delivered to diverse families.",A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families,9870787,F31DK116533,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent obesity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Food Supplements', 'Genetic', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Household', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nursery Schools', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'adult obesity', 'clinical care', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'ethnic disparity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'federal poverty level', 'feeding', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal weight', 'minority children', 'mortality', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2019,38616,0.094664717
"LANGUAGE LEARNING AND LANGUAGE INPUT The purpose of the program of research outlined in this grant proposal is to determine how child and adult language learners use the linguistic environment in acquiring the formal structure of a language.  The relation between linguistic input and learning will be investigated in two major areas.  The first area concerns the nature and role of linguistic feedback in first language acquisition: what type of feedback exists naturally; what type of feedback, when used experimentally, accelerates acquisition? The second area concerns how beginning learners, whether they are two-year-olds acquiring their native language or adults acquiring an artificial language, map out the basic pattern of a language.  The project will investigate the roles played by two different variables:  very high-frequency syntactic markers, and reference.  A variety of methods and a range of subject populations will be utilized.  Computer-assisted analysis of natural conversations between two-year-olds and their mothers will be used to investigate whether parents supply children with linguistically useful replies.  A training study will investigate experimentally the facilitating effects of different kinds of feedback on two- years-olds' acquisition of questions; a similar study will investigate different types of feedback to adults learning an artificial language.  Experimental studies of artificial language learning with older children and adults, investigating the role of reference and syntactic markers, will be performed.  Computer modeling of adult language learning will be used to examine different hypotheses of how adult and child learning of phrases occurs.

"ENHANCING PROJECTIVE TESTS USING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY The proposed research will apply state-of-the-art computer technology in digital sound, voice recognition, artificial intelligence, and graphical user interfaces to enhance the administration and scoring of a projective test which assesses social development in children and adolescents. Phase 1 objectives include: 1) designing and developing a system to record and transcribe the projective interview; 2) developing a prototype artificial intelligence (AI) scoring tool to train coders and assist them in scoring the interviews; and 3) field testing the above systems on a sample of 20 children and adolescents aged eleven to fourteen years. These innovations will enable the Separation Anxiety Test to be administered more readily to larger samples at lower cost, making it more widely available to investigators.  Successful completion of Phase 1 objectives will lead to a fully implemented system in Phase 2 which will be used to administer the projective measure to 250 children in a public school system.  The proposed research will more firmly establish the utility of a projective method for assessing an important dimension of child socio-emotional development.  The project will also demonstrate that technological innovations in the administration and scoring of projective tests could enable this class of psychological tools to become more widely employed in research and applied settings.  n/a",ENHANCING PROJECTIVE TESTS USING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY,3500115,R43HD030010,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior', ' child psychology', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' field study', ' interview', ' psychological tests', ' socializations']",NICHD,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",R43,1993,50000,0.092469229
"Real-Time Lexical and Semantic Processing in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children with any degree of hearing loss (HL) are at risk for language delays that persist into elementary school. The specific cognitive mechanisms responsible for these deficits remain an open question. A possible contributor to these language deficits is differences in real-time lexical access mechanisms. As a speech signal unfolds, partial word input (e.g., san-) causes the listener to activate multiple lexical candidates (e.g., sandal, sandwich) that are consistent with the signal phonology up to that point. Activation spreads to semantic features of these candidates (e.g., worn on foot, edible), which facilitates activation of semantically related words (e.g., sneaker, apple). Normal hearing adults immediately activate an array of phonological competitors and semantically related items, then rapidly suppress them once there is enough input to disambiguate the target. However, when there is substantial uncertainty in the signal (e.g., for prelingually deaf cochlear implant [CI] users), listeners take a different approach to spoken word recognition: they wait to hear more of the signal before activating any lexical candidates, thus reducing phonological competition. We know that prelingually deaf CI users show delayed activation and reduced phonological competition, but we do not know if listeners with moderately degraded input processed via hearing aids (HAs) show similar patterns of lexical access mechanisms. Furthermore, do these effects manifest in school-age children with HL, who are still undergoing rapid changes in lexical development? Even less is known about how individuals with HL use semantic activation during spoken word recognition. Semantic activation bridges single-word recognition with higher level language comprehension. Research suggests that children with HAs and CIs have weakened lexical-semantic connections, but we do not know if these weaknesses are significant enough to affect real-time semantic activation during running speech.

"Real-Time Lexical and Semantic Processing in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children with any degree of hearing loss (HL) are at risk for language delays that persist into elementary school. The specific cognitive mechanisms responsible for these deficits remain an open question. A possible contributor to these language deficits is differences in real-time lexical access mechanisms. As a speech signal unfolds, partial word input (e.g., san-) causes the listener to activate multiple lexical candidates (e.g., sandal, sandwich) that are consistent with the signal phonology up to that point. Activation spreads to semantic features of these candidates (e.g., worn on foot, edible), which facilitates activation of semantically related words (e.g., sneaker, apple). Normal hearing adults immediately activate an array of phonological competitors and semantically related items, then rapidly suppress them once there is enough input to disambiguate the target. However, when there is substantial uncertainty in the signal (e.g., for prelingually deaf cochlear implant [CI] users), listeners take a different approach to spoken word recognition: they wait to hear more of the signal before activating any lexical candidates, thus reducing phonological competition. We know that prelingually deaf CI users show delayed activation and reduced phonological competition, but we do not know if listeners with moderately degraded input processed via hearing aids (HAs) show similar patterns of lexical access mechanisms. Furthermore, do these effects manifest in school-age children with HL, who are still undergoing rapid changes in lexical development? Even less is known about how individuals with HL use semantic activation during spoken word recognition. Semantic activation bridges single-word recognition with higher level language comprehension. Research suggests that children with HAs and CIs have weakened lexical-semantic connections, but we do not know if these weaknesses are significant enough to affect real-time semantic activation during running speech.

"A Study of Distress and Parenting Concerns Among Adults with Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed survey study seeks to refine and validate the Parenting Concerns Questionnaire (PCQ), a new instrument that measures parenting concerns among adults with cancer who have children 18 years of age or younger. Background: The NCI estimates that 24% of adults with cancer have children under 18. Parenting concerns likely contribute to psychosocial distress in this population. Women under 50 are known to have greater psychosocial morbidity and poorer QoL, compared to older breast cancer patients, but it is not clear what the contributing factors are. Patients with clinically significant psychosocial distress are more likely to report problems dealing with their children, and yet there are no other data on parenting status and it's impact on patient distress. Pilot data on the PCQ indicates that parents with cancer have at significant levels of concern about their children and how to help them cope with the illness. Specific aims include: 1) To qualitatively refine and ensure acceptability of the PCQ. 2) To establish the reliability and validity of the PCQ. 3) To document the nature, pervasiveness and intensity of parenting concerns among cancer patients. Methods: This is an observational survey of 150 parents with cancer to test reliability and validity of the PCQ, and to document levels of psychosocial distress. Focus groups and qualitative data analyses will be used to refine the PCQ, followed by survey data collection in the outpatient clinics at the MGH Cancer Center (N=150). Principal components analyses with varimax rotation and Cronbach's alpha will be used to establish reliability and validity. Descriptive analyses of PCQ scores will be conducted, and scores will be correlated to measures of psychological distress (Distress Thermometer, HADS), QoL (FACT) and perceived prognosis. We will use a simultaneous multiple regression model for scores on the new PCQ, controlling for other measures of distress, to assess whether parenting concerns independently predict psychosocial distress. Conclusions: By developing a valid and reliable that can describe the nature and intensity of parenting concerns scale for clinical and research practice, we will contribute to an understanding of how these concerns affect the psychosocial distress of adults in treatment for cancer. This is a first step towards effectively addressing these issues and preventing multi-generational family distress.          n/a",A Study of Distress and Parenting Concerns Among Adults with Cancer,7292715,R03CA126394,"['18 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Distress', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Parenting behavior', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thermometers', 'Thinking', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Woman', 'cancer therapy', 'clinically significant', 'coping', 'instrument', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,R03,2007,84963,0.087925606
"Rare disease susceptibility alleles in children with Crohn disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposed project is to identify rare genetic variants contributing to childhood onset- Crohn disease. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract of unclear etiology and no known cure. Affected children suffer from diarrhea, abdominal pain, growth disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The identified Crohn disease susceptibility alleles have improved our understanding of Crohn disease pathogenesis. However, the identified susceptibility alleles do not account for the observed heritability, nor have disease-causing alleles in many genomic regions been identified. For the proposed studies, we will use 1) existing DNA samples collected from high-risk Crohn kindreds identified using the extensive genealogical records available only in Utah, 2) existing DNA samples obtained from very young children with Crohn disease and their parents, and 3) existing DNA samples obtained from healthy controls that are free of a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. Our overall hypothesis is that childhood- onset Crohn disease is caused in part by rare disease susceptibility alleles. In Aim 1, we will perform shared genomic segment analysis and exome sequencing in children in high-risk Crohn disease kindreds. In Aim 2, we will perform targeted re-sequencing studies and a case-control study in which the cases are very young children with Crohn disease. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that, as a consequence of the evolutionary forces, Crohn disease susceptibility alleles have hitchhiked on a previously identified disease risk haplotype in which the disease-causing variant(s) remains unknown. In this proposal, we will use a novel and powerful resource, the Utah Population Database, and further develop innovative analytical strategies to perform gene- mapping studies in large kindreds. We will utilize a phenotypic extreme-childhood-onset Crohn disease-to characterize the rare genetic variation in known susceptibility alleles. Finally, we will explore the evolutionary forces shaping a Crohn disease susceptibility locus, which may provide insight into the disease-causing gene. These studies will improve our understanding of the causes of Crohn disease, help develop clinically useful molecular classification schemes, and lead to improved therapy.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration.

"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood.

"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches.

"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology.

"Rare disease susceptibility alleles in children with Crohn disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposed project is to identify rare genetic variants contributing to childhood onset- Crohn disease. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract of unclear etiology and no known cure. Affected children suffer from diarrhea, abdominal pain, growth disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The identified Crohn disease susceptibility alleles have improved our understanding of Crohn disease pathogenesis. However, the identified susceptibility alleles do not account for the observed heritability, nor have disease-causing alleles in many genomic regions been identified. For the proposed studies, we will use 1) existing DNA samples collected from high-risk Crohn kindreds identified using the extensive genealogical records available only in Utah, 2) existing DNA samples obtained from very young children with Crohn disease and their parents, and 3) existing DNA samples obtained from healthy controls that are free of a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. Our overall hypothesis is that childhood- onset Crohn disease is caused in part by rare disease susceptibility alleles. In Aim 1, we will perform shared genomic segment analysis and exome sequencing in children in high-risk Crohn disease kindreds. In Aim 2, we will perform targeted re-sequencing studies and a case-control study in which the cases are very young children with Crohn disease. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that, as a consequence of the evolutionary forces, Crohn disease susceptibility alleles have hitchhiked on a previously identified disease risk haplotype in which the disease-causing variant(s) remains unknown. In this proposal, we will use a novel and powerful resource, the Utah Population Database, and further develop innovative analytical strategies to perform gene- mapping studies in large kindreds. We will utilize a phenotypic extreme-childhood-onset Crohn disease-to characterize the rare genetic variation in known susceptibility alleles. Finally, we will explore the evolutionary forces shaping a Crohn disease susceptibility locus, which may provide insight into the disease-causing gene. These studies will improve our understanding of the causes of Crohn disease, help develop clinically useful molecular classification schemes, and lead to improved therapy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEATLH Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine of unclear etiology and no known cure.

"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,8042604,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2011,291831,0.07287687

Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing.

"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered.

"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,9864807,R01HL150044,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Ratios', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congresses', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'abstracting', 'acute care', 'care costs', 'college', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data registry', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neonatal surgery', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'population based', 'repaired', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'years of life lost']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,495156,0.072614977
"COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CHILD LANGUAGE TRANSCRIPT DATA The CHILDES Project provides three crucial tools now being used by language researchers around the world.  The first tool is the CHILDES database of computerized transcripts from interactions between children and their parent.  This database includes data from earlier funded projects studying children from a variety of social groups, ages, languages, and medical conditions.  These data are made available to all researchers.  The second major tool is the CHAT transcription format which is used to encode the current database and new data being entered into the system.  The third major tool is the CLAN package of data analysis programs which can be used to automatically search the entire database for lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns relevant to key questions in developmental theory.  For the next funding period, the specific aims of the CHILDES project involve five major initiatives that seek to expand and refine the shapes of these three tools.  1.  The database initiative.  In this area, the goal is to improve the quality and quantity of the existing CHILDES database through additional data entry, detailed documentation, computer-assisted checking, and reformatting.  2.

"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10021724,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,613498,0.072141021

"Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) PROJECT SUMMARY – Original Submission Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human Subject Research', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Activity', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Transact', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'standard measure', 'stress reduction', 'translational approach', 'tv watching', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,0.064899439
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages.

"Effects of genetic and gestational  risk factors for late onset Alzheimer's disease on neonatal brain morphology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Effects of genetic and gestational  risk factors for late onset Alzheimer's disease on neonatal brain morphology,9882164,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,435345,0.060195111
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,0.059404607

The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,0.059404607
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,0.057746414

"INTERNET INTERVENTION TO PREVENT LANGUAGE DISORDERS Language delay is pervasive among preschool children. Early detection and preventative intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be cumulative, yet research shows that language intervention is not usually provided. We propose to develop a microcomputer-based system that can be used for language assessment and intervention over the Internet. We envision a system that includes (a) an on-line assessment based on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory that can collect and interpret parent report data and report results back to parents. and (b) an on-line intervention system designed to facilitate language - development in older infants and late.talking toddlers from l 2 to 36 months of age. The curricular design of the system will be based on contemporary- linguistic research. On-line delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks ongoing performance. Our Phase goal is to test the feasibility and technical merit of our plans. A prototype intervention module for early vocabulary development will be placed on- line, and 14 to 20 month old children who are late talkers will be given an opportunity to use the module at home with their parents. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers, and parents recognize the importance of early intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal law. We anticipate that an Internet-based intervention system to prevent language disorders and facilitate language development will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individualized services.  n/a",INTERNET INTERVENTION TO PREVENT LANGUAGE DISORDERS,6016960,R43DC004010,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' child (0-11)', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' language', ' language disorders', ' online computer', ' speech', ' speech disorders', ' vocabulary']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,1999,118269,0.05546205
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems.

"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many.

"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,0.051457417
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,0.049540181
"MATURATIONAL CHANGE IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION CAPACITY The present research program examines the developmental changes  which occur in the capacity for acquiring language. More  specifically, it examines what appears to be a sensitive period for  the acquisition of the grammar of a language. The first part of  this research program is descriptive. Four studied are proposed to  investigate the structural parameters and reliability of this  effect using a population of second language learners of varying  ages. An additional study will evaluate the uniqueness of this  effect for language by testing for age differences in music  learning. The second part of this program is experimental. It will  explore some of the changes that occur in the learning mechanism  over development which may underlie and explain the descriptive  phenomena. In particular it will explore possible child-adult  differences in the use of the operating principles used to convert  speech input into stored data. Seven studies are proposed. In each  study, two groups of children of the ages of 6-7 and 10-11 years  and one group of adults will be asked to learn a miniature  artificial language. The miniature language will be designed to  test the effects of morphological properties (including position,  frequency, stress and structure) on the success and patterning of  subjects' learning. In addition to documenting developmental  changes in the use of these operating principles, some studies will  test for the influence of first language typology on the use of  such principles.

"Wireless High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography for Decoding Brain Activity Project Summary This grant will develop a wireless wearable high-performance, high-density diffuse optical tomography (DOT) instrument for mapping of brain function in naturalistic settings. Functional neuroimaging of healthy adults has enabled mapping of brain function and revolutionized cognitive neuroscience. Increasingly, functional neuroimaging is being used in younger age groups, and as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the clinical setting. Its expanding application in the study of both health and disease necessitates new, more flexible tools. The logistics of traditional functional brain scanners (e.g., fMRI) are ill-suited to many subjects. In particular, fMRI is not suited for imaging subjects who cannot lie sufficiently still in MRI scanners. In addition to young children (i.e. under 5 years old) in general, this requirement also excludes children with disorders of voluntary movement, such as moderate to severe cerebral palsy. A majority of patients with CP have either spasticity and/or dyskinesia, movement disorders that prohibits successful fMRI due to motion artifacts. A subset of CP subjects can be considered to have effectively a pediatric form of a “locked-in-syndrome”, in the sense that, while intelligence can be spared entirely, motor system dysfunction prevents the ability to speak or sign. Not uncommonly, the intellectual capacities of these children are never recognized by care-providers, educators, and family members. Thus, there are many intriguing questions in the CP population that could be addressed with functional neuroimaging, such as questions of motor plasticity and learning, perhaps the most compelling is identifying and characterizing the cognitive and neuroanatomical architecture of children with CP who are locked in. Such work could provide a path to unlocking the cognitive capacities of children with severe motor dysfunction. These studies cannot be done with fMRI. Optical imaging has long held promise as a naturalistic neuroimaging technique. Recent development of high- density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a tomographic version of fNIRS, has improved image quality dramatically. When matched within subjects against fMRI, HD-DOT now can obtain localization errors <5mm, and point spread functions <15 mm FWHM, sufficient to localize functions to gyri. While initial HD-DOT reports have been confined to simpler sensory networks (visual and motor), recent results demonstrate the feasibility of mapping distributed cognitive networks, including the dorsal attention and default mode networks. Despite these advances, application of HD-DOT to naturalistic studies has been limited by a barrier imposed by a tradeoff between coverage and wear-ability. The central photonic challenges are optical sensitivity - which would bias design towards larger/heavier fibers, and coverage - which would bias design towards a larger number of fibers. In this proposal, Aims 1-2 address the technological challenges of developing a lightweight wireless HD-DOT(WHD-DOT) system. Aim 3 develops the functional neuroimaging paradigms needed to map and decode brain function with WHD-DOT. In Aim 4, we assess the feasibility of mapping and decoding pediatric patients with cerebral palsy using WHD-DOT.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries.

"Parent Initiated Prevention Program  DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) This randomized controlled trial tests a computer-driven, patient-centered, expert system to improve the provision of evidence-based prevention for young pediatric patients. We propose to study the effectiveness of a real-time Parent-Initiated Prevention Program (PIPP) in changing primary providers' delivery of preventive care as well as parental preventive behaviors. PIPP has two components: a parent educational one and a provider feedback one. PIPP differs from other provider interventions (including other computerized interventions) in that it delivers age specific, evidence-based recommendations directly to parents at their own behest and under their control prior to well-child visits via the Internet, accessed either at home or while in the waiting room of their providers' offices. In addition, it has the capacity to inform providers of the topics that parents are interested in learning more about. Using a factorial design to assess the marginal benefit of both of its components, PIPP will be deployed in four clinics of a practice network that has a commercially available electronic medical record system. We hypothesize that this approach will improve parent-provider communication over preventive health care, and by empowering families, it may be sufficient in itself to improve preventive practices.

"Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors program (SyMon-SAYS) for children with cancer in decreasing patients’ symptom burden, decreasing parent-perceived barriers in managing their child’s symptoms, increasing patients’ and parents’ self-efficacy and increasing patients’ quality of life.

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during eariy development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management  plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a  nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and  senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described.

"A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial-ethnic disparities in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest that all children with ADHD are at risk for poor quality of care. In order to better understand these disparities in ADHD care quality, Dr. Eugenia Chan, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, is submitting this revised applications for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to develop a cross-cultural, patient-centered approach for assessing quality of primary care management of children with ADHD. The overall goals are to develop a conceptual understanding of barriers to effective care from patient and family perspectives, to understand how and why these problems vary across cultural groups, and to develop instruments and methods to measure these patient-centered processes of care and to guide interventions to improve clinical care and outcomes for children with ADHD. The specific aims are to (1) develop a patient-centered model of ADHD care quality by investigating similarities and differences in African-American, Chinese-American, and European-American family experiences of ADHD care; (2) develop and validate a parent survey of patient-centered indicators of ADHD care quality that are sensitive to cross-cultural values regarding care for ADHD; and (3) test the survey in a diverse, primary care patient population to assess psychometric properties and identify disparities in patient-centered ADHD care quality. The results of this project will lead directly to future applications to (1) investigate relationships among patient-centered quality assessments, evidence-based quality indicators, and ADHD outcomes, (2) identify disparities in primary care management of ADHD, and (3) develop and implement targeted interventions to improve disparities in quality of ADHD care. The candidate has demonstrated skills as a developmental- behavioral pediatrician and junior health services researcher. The multidisciplinary education plan focuses on acquiring strong theoretical background and skills in qualitative methods, culture and disparities in mental health, advanced biostatistics, and measurement-based quality assessment and quality improvement. With an outstanding team of mentors and consultants, Dr. Chan's detailed, focused education and research plan will enable her to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful independent investigator devoted to understanding and reducing disparities in quality of care for children with mental health conditions.           n/a","A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care",7384292,K23MH079214,"['African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chinese American', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Confidentiality', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Eugenia', 'European', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life Experience', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'School Teachers', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'base', 'cost', 'cultural values', 'education planning', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'improved', 'instrument', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'willingness']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2008,179192,0.040794721

"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors.

"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents.

"Healthcare Access for Children of the Working Poor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Working poor families, who earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level, have long been overlooked by researchers and policy makers.  Despite their low earnings, adults in these families have not relied on public assistance and historically have not qualified for means-tested insurance programs such as Medicaid.  As a result, working poor families, many of whom do not receive health insurance benefits through their employer, have had difficulties accessing healthcare and meeting their healthcare needs.  With welfare reform setting short lifetime limits on the receipt of welfare and imposing work requirements, more families are transitioning into the ranks of the working poor.  Even though California is the most expensive state to reside in, its working poor families (18% of the state population) have the lowest average income in the nation.  In California, a large proportion of working poor families are immigrants. Evidence suggests that immigrant working poor children experience even greater difficulties in access to care.  In an effort to minimize these disparities, California has recently expanded health insurance coverage for eligible working poor children and their parents.  Yet there has been no population-based study to monitor the impact of these expansions.      The proposed study will analyze data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in an aim to fill gaps in knowledge of the extent to which children of the working poor access and utilize health services.  Specifically, it will 1) compare access and utilization of healthcare among working poor children with children in other socioeconomic strata; 2) explore the differences in access and utilization of healthcare between immigrant and native born children of the working poor; and 3) assess the extent to which expansions in health coverage for working poor parents can improve access and use of health services for their children.      CHIS, the largest cross-sectional state health survey of the civilian population ever conducted in the US, offers an excellent opportunity to examine healthcare access for working poor families.  The sampling frame, language capabilities, and 70% response rate for adults indicate that the data are likely to be representative of the California population.  Because this is the first large-scale data collection effort since California expanded health insurance access for the working poor, CHIS data will allow this study to monitor the extent to which these policies have affected access to and use of healthcare and the extent to which, by expanding insurance coverage for parents, children's access to care may also improve.  Further, it will allow for an assessment of the extent to which legal status influences access to and use of health services for working poor immigrants in California.  This study will help policy makers understand the determinants of access to care and use of health services as a first step towards assessing the quality of care for children of the working poor. n/a",Healthcare Access for Children of the Working Poor,6579110,R03HS013411,"['Medicare /Medicaid', ' Native Americans', ' children', ' clinical research', ' health care quality', ' health care service availability', ' health care service utilization', ' health insurance', ' health services research tag', ' health surveys', ' human data', ' immigrant', ' low socioeconomic status', ' medically underserved population', ' socioeconomics']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2002,99390,0.032061013
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment.

"Health Literacy and Information Management in ADHD: Designing an Optimal Record    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is an integral part of the pathway for the successful transfer of information between patients and providers. Parents of children with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) play an essential role in chronic care as they offer critical information to providers that drives appropriate education and disease management. We propose the development and evaluation of an electronic data entry tool that enables parents to communicate data essential to treatment of their children, regardless of their own literacy skills. The research plan addresses questions central to patient-centered information management: 1) how should a computer-based, personally controlled health record (PCHR) look and function to effectively gather data directly from patients, and, 2) how does health literacy influence parents' report of data on ADHD and the process-level events that result from parent-provider communication? The following specific aims organize the proposal: Aim 1. To identify and implement key features of data entry interfaces that create maximal usability across literacy levels for parental report on ADHD-related information, Aim 2. To assess the effect of health literacy on successful completion of parent-reported ADHD health information in both paper-based and PCHR formats, and Aim 3. To determine the association between health literacy and process-level outcomes for ADHD that stem from parent-provider exchange of information. Formative research methods during PCHR development will use one on one cognitive interviews, focus groups, and structured usability testing. The formal evaluation will study a diverse cohort of parents in a randomized trial of data entry (paper versus PCHR) for ADHD-specific information. Primary care records for children of this cohort will be analyzed for the prior 12 month period. Both a retrospective examination of documented ADHD processes of care and a prospective evaluation of the utility of data from the PCHR will occur.

"Health Literacy and Information Management in ADHD: Designing an Optimal Record    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is an integral part of the pathway for the successful transfer of information between patients and providers. Parents of children with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) play an essential role in chronic care as they offer critical information to providers that drives appropriate education and disease management. We propose the development and evaluation of an electronic data entry tool that enables parents to communicate data essential to treatment of their children, regardless of their own literacy skills. The research plan addresses questions central to patient-centered information management: 1) how should a computer-based, personally controlled health record (PCHR) look and function to effectively gather data directly from patients, and, 2) how does health literacy influence parents' report of data on ADHD and the process-level events that result from parent-provider communication? The following specific aims organize the proposal: Aim 1. To identify and implement key features of data entry interfaces that create maximal usability across literacy levels for parental report on ADHD-related information, Aim 2. To assess the effect of health literacy on successful completion of parent-reported ADHD health information in both paper-based and PCHR formats, and Aim 3. To determine the association between health literacy and process-level outcomes for ADHD that stem from parent-provider exchange of information. Formative research methods during PCHR development will use one on one cognitive interviews, focus groups, and structured usability testing. The formal evaluation will study a diverse cohort of parents in a randomized trial of data entry (paper versus PCHR) for ADHD-specific information. Primary care records for children of this cohort will be analyzed for the prior 12 month period. Both a retrospective examination of documented ADHD processes of care and a prospective evaluation of the utility of data from the PCHR will occur. Literacy level is a primary variable of interest throughout the evaluation. This work addresses two health information technology goals of the Department of Health and Human Services: connectivity that provides clinicians with up-to-date patient data and the promotion of patient involvement in care.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.           The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy.

"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,0.026328382
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment,9879567,R01ES031322,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '4 year old', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrazine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family health status', 'Food Supply', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herbicides', 'Human', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paraquat', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Phorate', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probiotics', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water Supply', 'acaricide', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'brain tissue', 'carcinogenesis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'drinking water', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'glyphosate', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'individualized prevention', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome sequencing', 'motor behavior', 'mouse model', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pesticide exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sample collection', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2020,282150,0.026116267
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite risk index Project Summary  More than 1 in 3 children from lower middle income countries (LMIC) are cognitively impaired and at risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) due to malnutrition, immune dysfunction, HIV, and poverty-associated parasitic infections. All LMIC children – including HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU), are at risk of ND but HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) are at elevated risk. Presently, there is no reliable approach to separate these vulnerable children along the continuum of risk for new-onset/progressive ND. This problem prevents risk-stratification, timely identification and targeting of at-risk children for ND remediation or prevention interventions. This project solves these problems by defining and validating a composite risk index (CRI) that integrates rigorously identified ND risk factors based on prior research to predict future new or progressive ND. The risk factors include malnutrition, immune dysfunction and HIV status. These factors will be combined into the CRI using modern machine learning methods and longitudinal data available from established cohort of 750 Ugandan children age 6 – 18 years (250 PHIV, 250 HEU and 250 HUU). For HEU and HIV-infected children this index will be refined into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, to include applicable maternal ART, child's viral genome, and cART factors.  Preliminary data from this cohort have demonstrated that cognitive indices vary significantly within the 12 months reassessment period. Additional preliminary data shows that despite HAART, chronic-HIV infection as well as nutritional, immunologic, and viral genome factors are associated with deficits in executive function, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life. We now propose to follow this already established cohort every 12 months to collect additional data at 0, 12, 24 and 36 months to be used in defining and validating CRI. CRI will be used to predict new-onset/progressive ND during follow-up. Specific aims include: 1. To develop a CRI by combining intake data on nutrition, immune parameters and HIV status and their  interactions and perform internal and external validation of CRI as predictor of ND at 12 months. 2. To further internally and externally validate CRI for “out-of-time-window” prediction from 24 to 36 months. 3. For HEU and HIV-infected children, to refine CRI into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, by including  type of maternal ART, viral genome parameters, current cART regimen/adherence (as applicable), and  their interactions. Overall Impact: This project advances the science needed to ensure that all children survive and thrive neurodevelopmentally whether HIV-infected, HEU, or HUU through establishment of predictive index for ND. Modifiable factors that are found to be driving this index can become potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies and behavioral interventions to mitigate the high burden of ND and/or HAND –if HIV infected. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE This project will define and validate a prognostic tool for proactively identifying children at elevated risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) and/or HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in order to produce knowledge that informs targets for interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and minimize ND/HAND. For the first time, established multiple separate risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment will be integrated to define a composite risk index based on factors of malnutrition and immune dysregulation. The index will then be refined for HIV-infected and HIV exposed uninfected children by incorporating maternal ART and HIV-specific factors – complications of long-term antiretroviral therapy and HIV-virus genetic factors. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page 1 of 1 Continuation Format Page",Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite risk index,10158811,R01NS122510,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biometry', 'CCR5 gene', 'CXCR4 gene', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Folic Acid', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'HIV', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Malnutrition', 'Microglia', 'Mitochondria', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Viral Genome', 'Viral Proteins', 'Vitamin D', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'chemokine', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome analysis', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'iron metabolism', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'macrophage', 'memory process', 'micronutrient deficiency', 'monocyte', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'nutrition', 'perinatal HIV', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'prognostic tool', 'psychosocial adjustment', 'remediation', 'success', 'virus genetics']",NINDS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,724145,0.021821094
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,0.019643533
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9936445,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664314,0.018600634

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.

This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9596160,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,405254,0.016560619
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis.

"Planning for a Cohort Study on Neurocognitive Complication of Type 1 Diabetes in Children Project Summary. Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer from subtle cognitive impairments and structural alterations in the brain. These impairments progress with age and may eventually lead to increased difficulty managing the disease, resulting in worsening glycemic control, potentially life-threatening complications, and reductions in quality of life. Causes of cognitive decline in T1D are not well understood. Episodes of hypoglycemia, chronic hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have all been suggested to play roles. Increased understanding of factors linked to cognitive decline in T1D, and the mechanisms responsible for these associations, is essential such that interventions to preserve cognition could be proposed. Recent data suggest that neuroinflammation resulting from hyperglycemia and episodes of DKA may be play a prominent role in causing cognitive decline. There is also evidence that modifiable factors such as nutrition, exercise, and sleep quality might modulate effects of chronic neuroinflammation and influence cognitive outcomes. In this project, we will engage in efforts to plan a comprehensive study of factors associated with cognition in children with T1D. At the completion of the proposed planning project, we will be prepared to conduct a longitudinal cohort study of children with newly diagnosed T1D. This study will determine how glycemic control and DKA exposure predict altered brain structure and cognition and establish whether markers of neuronal injury and inflammatory processes explain these longitudinal relations. Proposed assessments will include T1D-related factors (glycemic control, glycemic variability, hypoglycemia, DKA), brain structure and cognitive function (attention, memory and IQ). In addition, we will plan measurements of inflammatory mediators and markers of neuroinflammation using blood assays (cytokine measurements, exosome analyses, RNA microarrays), and evaluate factors that might modify inflammation such as diet (nutrient content), sleep quality and exercise. To optimize the study design, we will utilize the expertise of a multidisciplinary team to develop the study protocol, including experts in pediatric diabetes, cognitive development, neural and systemic inflammation, MR imaging, nutrition, sleep medicine, and data science. The team will work together to finalizing the protocol, work-flow and outcome measures, and identify the necessary computational infrastructure and data analysis strategies. The team will also assess study feasibility (factors affecting enrollment success and tolerance of the protocol) and determine necessary sample size by evaluating variability in biochemical and imaging measures. Alternative approaches to increase participant retention, such as remote (online) versus in person cognitive testing, will be explored. At the conclusion of this planning project, we will have developed and optimized a protocol to explore factors associated with cognitive decline in children with T1D, laying a foundation for future studies aimed at preserving cognitive function. Narrative. Individuals with type 1 diabetes often have declines in cognitive function over time, with a high risk of cognitive impairments and dementia as older adults. The physiological events responsible for cognitive damage in T1D are not understood, and it is unclear how cognitive decline might be prevented.

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,0.0038673
"Efficacy of Treatments for Sexually Abused Children: A Meta-Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large body of literature has documented negative mental health and behavioral outcomes for sexually abused children (e.g., PTSD, depression, ADHD). In response to these problems, researchers have developed individual, group, and family interventions for treating children who have experienced sexual abuse. The goal of the proposed project is to conduct the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date of the efficacy of psychological and behavioral treatments for sexually abused children. The overarching objectives of the project are to determine what treatments are most effective and under what conditions such treatments work best. The specific aims of this project include: evaluating treatment efficacy for the most common psychological sequelae of CSA among children (PTSD, externalizing disorders, and affective disorders); investigating treatment characteristics (e.g., theoretical approach to treatment, treatment modality, type of study design) that may moderate the efficacy of interventions for children with a history of CSA; examining the impact of the participant characteristics of age, gender, and ethnicity on treatment outcomes. To accomplish these aims the candidate will conduct a meta-analysis, involving a comprehensive literature search of all relevant social science retrieval systems, code each study according to a specified coding system, and calculate effect sizes that correspond to each specific aim. The candidate proposes a multifaceted training plan that involves coursework and consultation with experts to enhance her knowledge of meta-analytic techniques, supervised clinical experience treating victims of CSA, and ongoing research collaboration with her mentor on topics related to the long-term outcomes of child maltreatment. The objectives of this project are an excellent fit with the mission of NIH because of the application of advanced statistical techniques to understand interventions for a myriad of mental health problems associated with CSA, a risk factor not only for short-term difficulties but also for long-term problems related to mental and physical health functioning. This project is particularly relevant to public health given the high percentage of girls (20 percent) and boys (14 percent) who are victims of sexual abuse (Finkelhor, 1994), and the potential negative outcomes of sexual abuse: sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and mental health problems (Tyler, 2002). This study addresses the tertiary level of prevention by investigating treatments aimed at reducing negative mental and behavioral health outcomes that occur following sexual abuse.          n/a",Efficacy of Treatments for Sexually Abused Children: A Meta-Analysis,7407698,F31MH080533,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Disease', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual abuse', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unwanted pregnancy', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'boys', 'experience', 'girls', 'psychologic', 'response', 'size', 'text searching']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,F31,2007,25132,0.002218181
"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental, immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.           The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years.

"Tools for Automated Assessment of Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders including Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It is increasingly recognized that assessment should include spontaneous natural language samples. There are measures, such as the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), which are laborious to apply, since they require manual analysis of a corpus of sentences collected from the child. There is therefore a strong need for automated tools to aid clinicians in this task, and to provide more robust analyses for assessment. Many widely-used commercial software packages, such as the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) do little more than count linguistic features, and still require someone to code those features. Fully automated systems, such as Computerized Profiling (CP) do exist, but reports vary on how well they work. However, recent advances in natural language processing, in particular in the realm of grammar adaptation, mean that we are now able to produce high-quality commercial software that can be used by clinical practitioners in their assessment of child language. This project will build a commercially viable suite of fully automated, software-based tools, requiring no special equipment beyond a standard personal computer, targeted at clinicians who work with children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The system will have been evaluated not only with children with Typical Development (TD), but with data from children with ASD and DLD. The system will include the following components: (1) text normalization tools to help with the clean up and normalization of transcriptions; (2) a state -of-the-art part-of-speech tagger; (3) a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer; (4) a state-of-the-art syntactic parser; (5) a dependency analyzer and semantic-role labeler, (6) a scoring module to take the output of the language analysis, and map this to the IPSyn or other scales. The software will be written in C++ and Java, and will adopt a rigorous industrial coding style, namely the Google style guide, which is in the public domain. As part of an NIH-funded project on Autism, the Center for Spoken Language Understanding, in collaboration with colleagues at Yale University, has collected a corpus of video and audio recorded interactions of children with ASD and DLD, as well as TD children ages 4-8. In this STTR-funded project, we will perform a manual IPSyn assessment on these data and provide the results as a benchmark on how well the system will perform in the field. While the target language for the initial development will be English, the software will be written in a fully language-independent fashion, in that no properties of English will be hard-coded into the system. All that would be required to 'port' the system to a new language would be appropriate training material for the language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, and it is increasingly recognized that assessment should involve the analysis of spontaneous language samples. This project will develop a package of software programs for the automatic analysis of spontaneous language samples from children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The program will be usable directly by clinicians in their assessment of patients.          n/a",Tools for Automated Assessment of Language,7800817,R41DC010502,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Benchmarking', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Language', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Personal Computers', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Special Equipment', 'Speech', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'indexing', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,"BIOSPEECH, INC.",R41,2009,198687,-0.004402963
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,-0.014132948

"Immunologic and Virologic Correlates of the Age-Related Decrease in HBV DNA in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus infection in children is an important public health problem, with the majority of children acquiring HBV via maternal-fetal acquisition, putting them at high lifetime risk (~25 - 50%) of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBe Antigen (HBeAg) positivity and persistently high levels of HBV DNA are independent risk factors for cirrhosis and HCC in adults. While little is known about the immunologic response to HBV DNA in children, we have observed that older children in the HBRN have higher rates of HBeAg clearance and lower levels of HBV DNA compared to younger subjects. Thus, careful investigation of T cell responses to HBV antigens and cytokine/chemokine patterns in children of different ages may reveal immunologic determinants associated with viral clearance and lead to improved antiviral therapies in the future. The overarching goals of this application are two-fold: 1) Continue recruiting and enrolling children t the pediatric HBRN studies and retaining the 156 (pediatric cohort) and 31 immune tolerant (IT) subjects already enrolled by the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Clinical Center (pediatric liver centers at Johns Hopkins, UTSW and University of Washington 2) Characterize T cell immune phenotypes and responses to HBV antigens and cytokine chemokine patterns in HBV-infected children in 2 age groups 5 - 10 years vs 10 -18 years compared to age and sex-matched non-infected controls and existing T cell data in adults. The immune phenotype of T cells will be characterized by staining (multi-color FACS.) In vitro blockade of inhibitory pathways such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 to 'unmask' the underlying immune function in select patients will be explored. In the same patients and controls, the patterns of cytokines/chemokines will be assayed using LuminexTM (Austin, TX) apparatus and specific beadsets (Millipore, Billerica, MA): IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MIG, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, GM-CSF, Eotaxin, and TNF-alpha. This immunological profile data will be analyzed using computational modeling, including Principal Component Analysis, hierarchical clustering, and network discovery methods; relationships between immune responses, HBeAntigen, and HBV DNA levels will be characterized. The significance of this project is to continue the productive contributions of the JHPCC to the pediatric studies of the HBRN and to contribute novel information regarding the effects of age on immune responses of children with HBV.

"Immunologic and Virologic Correlates of the Age-Related Decrease in HBV DNA in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus infection in children is an important public health problem, with the majority of children acquiring HBV via maternal-fetal acquisition, putting them at high lifetime risk (~25 - 50%) of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBe Antigen (HBeAg) positivity and persistently high levels of HBV DNA are independent risk factors for cirrhosis and HCC in adults. While little is known about the immunologic response to HBV DNA in children, we have observed that older children in the HBRN have higher rates of HBeAg clearance and lower levels of HBV DNA compared to younger subjects. Thus, careful investigation of T cell responses to HBV antigens and cytokine/chemokine patterns in children of different ages may reveal immunologic determinants associated with viral clearance and lead to improved antiviral therapies in the future. The overarching goals of this application are two-fold: 1) Continue recruiting and enrolling children t the pediatric HBRN studies and retaining the 156 (pediatric cohort) and 31 immune tolerant (IT) subjects already enrolled by the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Clinical Center (pediatric liver centers at Johns Hopkins, UTSW and University of Washington 2) Characterize T cell immune phenotypes and responses to HBV antigens and cytokine chemokine patterns in HBV-infected children in 2 age groups 5 - 10 years vs 10 -18 years compared to age and sex-matched non-infected controls and existing T cell data in adults. The immune phenotype of T cells will be characterized by staining (multi-color FACS.) In vitro blockade of inhibitory pathways such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 to 'unmask' the underlying immune function in select patients will be explored. In the same patients and controls, the patterns of cytokines/chemokines will be assayed using LuminexTM (Austin, TX) apparatus and specific beadsets (Millipore, Billerica, MA): IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MIG, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, GM-CSF, Eotaxin, and TNF-alpha.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9881344,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,782692,-0.031998403
