"Chemoreceptor Cell Development in the Carotid Body    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The carotid body (CB), a major hypoxic chemosensory organ, induces reflex responses in many vital organs. The hypoxic responses among individuals are variable, and genetic differences may be an underlying mechanism. Examples can be seen in humans as well as inbred strains of mice. We have shown that a large CB and robust hypoxic responses in DBA/2J mice, and a small CB and weak responses in A/J mice. Our preliminary data show that these differences in the CBs develop after birth. Our other important findings are: (1) The expression of GDNF mRNA in the CB of DBA/2J mice was higher than in the CB of A/J mice. (2) GDNF gene expression correlated to glomus cell (GC) number index in the DBA/2J, A/J and offspring mice. (3) The number of GCs increased from 1-day to 4-week-old in DBA/2J mice, but not in A/J mice. (4) Proliferation of GCs was more robust in DBA/2J than in A/J mice at 1-2 weeks of age. (4) Expression and activity of BK channels in GCs were high in DBA/2J mice and low in A/J mice. (5) When CBs of young A/J mice were cultured with GDNF, BK channel mRNA and channel activity became similar to that of DBA/2J mice. (6) Hypoxic sensitivity, monitored by voltage-dependent K channel activity in GCs and intracellular Ca2+ in CBs, was higher in DBA/2J than in A/J mice. Based on these observations and literature search, we have hypothesized: (1) GDNF plays a critical role for postnatal survival and growth of GCs. (2) GDNF promotes the expression of BK channels, which support postnatal survival and hypoxic sensitivity of GCs. Specific aims of this proposal are to determine: (1) the role of GDNF for postnatal survival and growth of GCs; (2) if GDNF promotes the expression of BK channels in developing GCs; (3) the role of BK channels for postnatal survival of GCs; (4) if the GDNF-mediated BK channel expression supports hypoxic sensitivity of GCs during postnatal development. A newly developed whole CB culture system together with patch clamp, Ca2+ imaging, RT-PCR (using whole CB and single GC), morphometry, and immunohistochemistry will be applied. Studying genetic bases of postnatal maturation of the CB may provide some insights into hypoxic chemoreception and chemotransduction pathways. Further, therapeutic measures may be developed for CB-related diseases such as sudden infant death syndrome, congenital hypoventilation syndrome, ventilatory problems in Prader-Willi syndrome, chronic heart failure, and primary hypertension.           n/a",Chemoreceptor Cell Development in the Carotid Body,7437238,R01HL081345,"['A/J Mouse', 'Acetylcholine', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Birth', 'Brain Hypoxia-Ischemia', 'Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Carotid Body', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoreceptors', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Fetus', 'Figs - dietary', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Glomus Cell', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hyperoxia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Myxoid cyst', 'Neonatal', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological reperfusion', 'Play', 'Potassium Channel', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome', 'Proteins', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Week', 'base', 'day', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'environmental change', 'glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'insight', 'large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels', 'mature animal', 'morphometry', 'neonate', 'patch clamp', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'response', 'text searching', 'voltage']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,369000,0.240471538

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,0.231816102

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances.

"Mining Genomic Data in FaceBase for Cleft Genes Project Summary Cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) are among the most common congenital birth defects with a prevalence of around 1/700 live births in the world. Mouse and human genetic studies, as well as the epidemiology, have identified a wide array of genetic and environmental risk factors for CL/P. However, the etiology of CL/P has not been fully understood yet because of the complexity of genetic and environmental risk factors as well as gene-environment interactions. The mouse model is one of the most frequently used and well-established animal models to study the mechanism of craniofacial development. The FaceBase Consortium funded by NIDCR has been generating a large number of datasets since 2009. This includes many genomic datasets such as mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and enhancer data, which covers mouse lip and palate development (e.g. embryonic days E10.5 to E14.5). While such data provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover the molecular cascades that control craniofacial development and link to various diseases and phenotypes, there have been main challenges and technical issues that strongly limit the interrogation of the data across the domains, mouse strains, or multiple FaceBase datasets. Specifically, the currently available FaceBase data were generated from different mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S6, and CD-1) by using different platforms (Illumina HiSeq 2000, 2500, Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0, and Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0ST) for different tissues at different embryonic days. To address these challenges and improve our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in CL/P, we propose three specific aims in this proposal. In Aim 1,! we will evaluate mRNA and miRNA expression between mouse strains C57BL/6J and 129S6 through a modified Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, which can effectively adjust the biases from various FaceBase datasets. The information we learn will serve as an important guidance on data integration between genomic platforms and between mouse strains, leading to reproducible research. In Aim 2, we will identify long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression information by reusing FaceBase microarray and RNA-sequencing data, adding an important category of non-coding RNA information to the FaceBase consortium. We will next conduct bioinformatics curation for regulatory relationships among transcription factor, miRNA, lncRNA, and protein- coding gene for CL/P genes in mice. In Aim 3, we will distribute the gene expression (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA) and their regulatory annotations to the research community through our CleftGeneDB database and the FaceBase Portal. The successful completion of this project will provide investigators with important guidance on secondary analysis of FaceBase genomic data across platforms and mouse strains as well as a comprehensive web resource for genes related to CL/P. Project Narrative The FaceBase Consortium has recently generated many genomic datasets in mice in order to accelerate the understanding of craniofacial development biology. In this proposal, to maximize the use of FaceBase genomic data, we will first perform comprehensive evaluation of various FaceBase genomic datasets and functional annotations in mice and then distribute these processed and annotated data related to cleft genes to the research community through the CleftGeneDB database and FaceBase Portal. The successful completion of this project will provide investigators with important guidance on reanalysis of FaceBase genomic data across platforms and mouse strains, as well as a user-friendly, content-driven online resource for cleft lip and palate.",Mining Genomic Data in FaceBase for Cleft Genes,9784797,R03DE028103,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Imagery', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Mandible', 'Manuals', 'Maxilla', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Mus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Names', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Palate', 'Play', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'cleft lip and palate', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data integration', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'mouse model', 'online resource', 'prototype', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R03,2019,154000,0.200852428

The successful completion of this project will provide investigators with important guidance on reanalysis of FaceBase genomic data across platforms and mouse strains, as well as a user-friendly, content-driven online resource for cleft lip and palate.",Mining Genomic Data in FaceBase for Cleft Genes,9592443,R03DE028103,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Imagery', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Mandible', 'Manuals', 'Maxilla', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Mus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Names', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Palate', 'Play', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'cleft lip and palate', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data integration', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'mouse model', 'online resource', 'prototype', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R03,2018,154000,0.200852428
"A Novel Modifier Locus Suppressing ApcMin Intestinal Polyposis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer in humans is a leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.A. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by hundreds to thousands of benign polyps in the colon, which if left untreated may become malignant. The mutant adenomatous polyposis coli (ApcMin/+) mouse is an effective model to study the initiation, growth, and progression of colorectal cancer. Genetic background greatly influences polyp number, size, position and stage in ApcMin/+ mice, and modifier genes can alter these phenotypes. The major goal of this proposal is to identify the gene or genes responsible for the novel Modifier of Min 4 (Mom4) phenotype on mouse Chromosome 2. Our preliminary studies have provided three lines of evidence for this novel locus: 1) a QTL analysis, 2) B6.C3H and C3H.B6 reciprocal congenic crosses, and 3) a BXH Rl line backcross. In Specific Aim 1, classical genetic crosses involving congenic and consomic mice will be used to narrow the boundaries of the Mom4 locus. In Specific Aim 2, we will prioritize candidate genes for investigation based on predetermined and experimental criteria. In Specific Aim 3, we will generate a transgenic mouse model to test the effects of the Mom4 gene. This project will lead to an understanding of how allelic differences can alter the tumor phenotype. The study of modifier genes will impact the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human colorectal cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer in humans is a leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.A.

"Information theoretic assays of exploration in aged mice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Normal aging is accompanied by alterations in both cognitive and emotional function. While these changes are of modest significance in otherwise healthy elders, they can have devastating impacts in persons with dementia or cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, current knowledge of the basic neuroscience underlying behavioral disturbances in the elderly remains very poorly understood. Aged mice are appropriate models to address this significant deficit. Neurophysiology of the aging mouse brain resembles that seen in man, and many behaviors observable in mice have close human parallels. For example, in both mouse and man there is an age-related decline in gross exploration of a new environment. Exploratory behavior is modulated in a specific manner by different neurotransmitter systems; thus, sophisticated analyses of exploratory behavior can provide important insights into age-related changes in CNS function. Currently, powerful tools to study exploratory behavior are lacking; we propose to develop these tools. We will develop a multiple behavioral state (MBS) representation of arena influences on mouse location, mouse locomotor activity (stop/pausing, turning, and progression), and other mouse ethological parameters (rearing, stretching, grooming, etc.). We will then extend this approach to study how acquisition of place memories alters variables within the MBS model. The entropy rate and predictive information will be calculated for these data and used to quantify the amount of randomness and complexity of the responses. Validation data will be collected in young (6 wk), mid-life (12 month) and aged (>24 month) C57BI6 mouse cohorts. Our preliminary results show that aged mice have less complex novel environment exploratory patterns compared to a younger cohort. The analytic tools developed in this study will be invaluable when evaluating the efficacy of future pharmacological or genetic-based therapies to enhance cognitive and emotional function in patients with dementia.             n/a",Information theoretic assays of exploration in aged mice,7244069,R21AG026043,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Age-Months', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Face', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Grooming', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Serial Learning', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'disability', 'innovation', 'insight', 'male', 'man', 'middle age', 'neurophysiology', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'vector']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R21,2007,156501,0.199521715
"Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation SUMMARY Recent technological developments such as tissue clearing and light sheet imaging have allowed for the three- dimensional visualization of the entire brain at cellular resolution. Translucence Biosystems has advanced this technology further by developing a) a proprietary Mesoscale Imaging System that allows visualization of an entire mouse brain much faster than prior techniques, b) machine learning-based algorithms that identify individual cells across the entire intact mouse brain and c) routines that rapidly determine cell densities in >1,200 brain regions defined by the annotated Allen Brain Atlas.  In the present proposal we will show the power of our technique by visualizing microglia density across the entire mouse brain as a biological marker for neuroinflammation. Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. While they play important roles in healthy brain function, they also mediate neuroinflammatory processes that have a significant impact in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis as well as play possible roles in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, chemo brain). A tool for three-dimensional imaging of neuroinflammation patterns across the whole brain will help advance our understanding of neuroinflammatory processes in neurological diseases and aid in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.  To visualize microglia, we will evaluate multiple strategies, including the CX3CR1-GFP mouse line, which expresses GFP in microglia, Iba1 immunolabeling and other antibody markers of activated microglia. The utility of our approach for monitoring neuroinflammation will be demonstrated in CX3CR1-GFP mice by treating them with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice will be injected with three different LPS doses, and then microglia will be visualized and automatically counted across >1,200 brain regions. We will confirm the neuroinflammatory response to LPS by measuring protein markers of inflammation.  The applicability of our technique to neurodegenerative disease will be demonstrated by studying a mouse line used as a model of Alzheimer's disease that presents pronounced patterns of neuroinflammation. These experiments are designed to prove that our approach can provide reliable and detailed information describing neuroinflammation and that our results are better in terms of speed, resolution, and richness of information than any other technique available.  Once the goals for Phase I are met, we will be positioned to develop our microglia activation assay into a new gold standard for precise and complete histological detection of neuroinflammation. During phase II, we plan to 1) develop machine learning tools to establish morphological criteria that differentiate resting from activated microglia, 2) characterize microglial signatures in various mouse models of diseases with known or suspected neuroinflammation components, and 3) validate the microglial targeting of anti-inflammatory therapeutic candidates. NARRATIVE Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, protect against injury and infection. Microglia also play a critical role in dysfunctional neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to the development of brain diseases. We have developed novel methods to make mouse brains transparent so we can visualize and precisely count microglia throughout the intact mouse brain. In this proposal, we will test the feasibility of measuring brain-wide microglia activation using two disease models with a strong neuroinflammatory component, including a common transgenic mouse model that recapitulates the amyloid plaque accumulation that is a central feature of Alzheimer’s Disease.",Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation,9908302,R43MH122070,"['AIDS dementia', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Encephalitis', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Light', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Senile Plaques', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'abeta deposition', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'chemobrain', 'cytokine', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NIMH,"TRANSLUCENCE BIOSYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,449956,0.182835035

"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models.

"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development.

"Characterization of MDM2 in Craniofacial Development PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic intervention for prenatally diagnosed craniofacial defects holds promise for improved quality of life. Early detection, however, requires an improved understanding of the genetic factors underlying the craniofacial dysmorphologies. We have recently identified a role for MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor protein, in craniofacial development. Mice hypomorphic for Mdm2 exhibit craniofacial defects including cleft palate that are strain-dependent, suggesting that these genetic backgrounds encode variation at modifier loci which affect craniofacial development and the severity of craniofacial anomalies. The overall goal of this project is to obtain detailed information about the head and face phenotype of Mdm2 hypomorphic mice, which will guide future mechanistic studies of craniofacial development and form the basis for unbiased, forward genetic approaches to identify novel modifiers of craniofacial malformation. In Specific Aim 1, we gain insight into the cells, tissues, and structures altered by low MDM2 expression by quantifying the craniofacial dysmorphologies in Mdm2 hypomorphic mice. In Specific Aim 2, we examine the gene regulatory networks underlying the penetrance and expressivity of craniofacial anomalies in Mdm2 hypomorphic mice by obtaining detailed information about the differences in gene expression in embryos on the sensitized and nonsensitized genetic backgrounds. Together, our studies contribute to the mission of the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to develop new early detection and personalized therapeutic intervention strategies for craniofacial defects by yielding new understanding of the gene and protein networks that govern craniofacial development and by providing new insight into how perturbing these networks influences clinical severity.

"Voxelation: a new method for 3D gene expression analysis   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major opportunity for the post-genomic        world will be to understand how the genome constructs the brain, and how this        process goes awry in disease. The approach we are taking combines the                computational procedures of biomedical imaging technologies, such as CT and          PET, with high throughput methods to acquire 3D gene expression patterns in the      brain. This new technology is called voxelation, and gets its name from the          term ""voxel,"" which refers to a cubic 3D image volume element. The voxel is the      3D analog of the familiar 2D image element, the pixel. Voxelation entails the        direct creation of voxels (cubes) in spatial register with the brain, and            application of high throughput gene expression analytic techniques to RNA            extracted from the voxels. Imaging algorithms are then employed to reconstruct       spatial information in high throughput. Using microarrays, we have obtained low      resolution (40 voxel) images of the normal mouse brain for 9,000 genes, giving       novel insights into the construction of the brain by the genome. Also using          microarrays, we have acquired 2,000 gene, 24 voxel images of coronal                 hemisections of both normal and Alzheimer's disease human brains at the level        of the hippocampus. Our analysis has revealed a common network of co-regulated       genes, and allowed identification of putative control regions. In addition, a        number of intriguing candidate genes have been found whose level of expression       is significantly different between the Alzheimer's and normal hemisections.          Finally, singular value decomposition (SVD), a mathematical technique used to        provide parsimonious explanations of complex data sets, produced images that         distinguished between brain structures, including cortex, caudate and                hippocampus. Building on the foundations provided by these studies, voxelation       will be employed in two Specific Aims using the mouse. (1.) Using microarrays,       low resolution (40 voxel) high throughput (9,000) gene images of the brain will      be acquired in four mouse models of human neuropsychiatric disorders:                Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, schizophrenia, and dopamine D3 receptor         deficiency. (2.) To extend the technology of voxelation, high resolution (300        voxel) moderate throughput (hundreds of gene) images of the mouse brain will be      obtained using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. An instrument, the voxelator, has      been constructed for semiautomated miniaturized harvesting of the voxels.            Images from both Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated using classical             techniques, such as in situ hybridization.

In addition, a        number of intriguing candidate genes have been found whose level of expression       is significantly different between the Alzheimer's and normal hemisections.          Finally, singular value decomposition (SVD), a mathematical technique used to        provide parsimonious explanations of complex data sets, produced images that         distinguished between brain structures, including cortex, caudate and                hippocampus. Building on the foundations provided by these studies, voxelation       will be employed in two Specific Aims using the mouse. (1.) Using microarrays,       low resolution (40 voxel) high throughput (9,000) gene images of the brain will      be acquired in four mouse models of human neuropsychiatric disorders:                Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, schizophrenia, and dopamine D3 receptor         deficiency. (2.) To extend the technology of voxelation, high resolution (300        voxel) moderate throughput (hundreds of gene) images of the mouse brain will be      obtained using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. An instrument, the voxelator, has      been constructed for semiautomated miniaturized harvesting of the voxels.

"Genetic Determinants of Orofacial Shape and Relationship to Cleft Lip/Palate    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial clefts, principally cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), and cleft lip and palate (CLP), are among the most common major birth defects, occurring in ~1/700 to 1/1000 live births in various populations around the world, ~70% as a sporadic, isolated abnormality. Such ""non-syndromic"" orofacial clefts act as complex traits, involving multiple genes and environmental risk factors. To date traditional genetic mapping approaches have identified only a few major susceptibility genes for non-syndromic orofacial clefts with certainty. Therefore, new approaches are clearly required. There is considerable evidence that orofacial malformations can occur at the extremes of the normal ranges of phenotypic variation of midfacial size and shape. Here we propose a novel approach to identify genes that regulate midfacial shape in mouse and human. We hypothesize that genes that are major contributors to normal orofacial size and shape will also have important roles in the occurrence of orofacial clefts. To identify such genes, we will perform detailed morphometric analysis of midfacial shape differences in innovative mouse strains as well as in select human populations, combining these studies with genetic analyses to identify genes that control major determinants of midfacial morphometries. Our studies have shown that specific inbred strains of mice have heritable differences in measurable parameters of facial shape. We will take advantage of a valuable new resource we have developed, the mouse ""Collaborative Cross"" (CC), to correlate heritable differences in facial shape among the 8 founder strains of the CC, along with select Recombinant Inbred lines and Recombinant Intercross (RIX), with detailed genetic mapping data for these mice. This approach will enable identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie these morphometric differences. We will complement our mouse studies with a similar analysis of humans, studying specific populations with different susceptibilities to orofacial clefts. These comparative studies will allow us to identify genes that underlie midfacial shape in humans. Finally, we will perform functional studies to assess how the genes we have identified can influence facial shape. Together, these studies should provide a basis for understanding the relationship between human facial morphogenesis and susceptibility to orofacial clefts, and for initiating studies of the functions of these genes in animal models relevant to human orofacial development.

"Genetic Determinants of Orofacial Shape and Relationship to Cleft Lip/Palate    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial clefts, principally cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), and cleft lip and palate (CLP), are among the most common major birth defects, occurring in ~1/700 to 1/1000 live births in various populations around the world, ~70% as a sporadic, isolated abnormality. Such ""non-syndromic"" orofacial clefts act as complex traits, involving multiple genes and environmental risk factors. To date traditional genetic mapping approaches have identified only a few major susceptibility genes for non-syndromic orofacial clefts with certainty. Therefore, new approaches are clearly required. There is considerable evidence that orofacial malformations can occur at the extremes of the normal ranges of phenotypic variation of midfacial size and shape. Here we propose a novel approach to identify genes that regulate midfacial shape in mouse and human. We hypothesize that genes that are major contributors to normal orofacial size and shape will also have important roles in the occurrence of orofacial clefts. To identify such genes, we will perform detailed morphometric analysis of midfacial shape differences in innovative mouse strains as well as in select human populations, combining these studies with genetic analyses to identify genes that control major determinants of midfacial morphometries. Our studies have shown that specific inbred strains of mice have heritable differences in measurable parameters of facial shape. We will take advantage of a valuable new resource we have developed, the mouse ""Collaborative Cross"" (CC), to correlate heritable differences in facial shape among the 8 founder strains of the CC, along with select Recombinant Inbred lines and Recombinant Intercross (RIX), with detailed genetic mapping data for these mice. This approach will enable identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie these morphometric differences. We will complement our mouse studies with a similar analysis of humans, studying specific populations with different susceptibilities to orofacial clefts. These comparative studies will allow us to identify genes that underlie midfacial shape in humans.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.                  The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease.

"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.111939203
"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models. These approaches will also be applied to investigate nuclear architecture in mouse models with mutations in genes relevant to nuclear structure, which will help advance our understanding of diseases such as laminopathy and cancer.",UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center,10151918,UM1HG011586,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Four-dimensional', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterochromatin', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lamin Type A', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'Whole Organism', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cell type', 'human data', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'knowledge translation', 'lamin B receptor', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleophosmin', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UM1,2020,2031051,0.10859978
"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression. Statistical and bioinformatic approaches will be used to identify potential markers and their classification power will be evaluated. The microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will also be identified and evaluated.            Reference to Public Health (Project Narrative): Oral cancer is one of the most devastating cancers.

"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol. Deliverables          from the work include an open source, public domain, web-accessible tool kit of      noise-aware machine learning (classification and clustering) tools that are          anticipated to be widely applicable to the analysis of time series of gene           expression networks in complex biological systems. In addition, it is                anticipated that candidate genes with possible roles in cerebellar granule cell      proliferation, differentiation or possibly, tumorigenesis, will emerge that can      be analyzed in future hypothesis-driven projects.                                                                                                                         n/a",FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM,6394443,R21NS041764,"['artificial intelligence', ' cerebellum', ' developmental genetics', ' developmental neurobiology', ' flow cytometry', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetically modified animals', ' granule cell', ' green fluorescent proteins', ' in situ hybridization', ' laboratory mouse', ' neurogenetics', ' reporter genes']",NINDS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R21,2001,229539,0.103529633

"Co-expression Networks of Addiction-Related Genes in the Mouse and Human Brain Project Summary/Abstract  The increasing availability of genome wide data sets promise to shed light into the etiology and  pathophysiology of genetically complex disorders, including substance abuse and dependence.  There remain significant challenges, however: although there is evidence for significant  heritability, genome wide association studies have typically revealed small effect sizes, possibly  due to the polygenic nature of the disorders. The brain-wide gene expression data sets from the  Allen Institute offers new data sources that could be used to group genes together based on  similarities in their expression profiles in anatomic space, thus enhancing the power of statistical  tests in genome-wide studies. Due to the unprecedented spatial resolution in these data sets, with  genome-wide and brain-wide coverage, specific hypotheses involving intercellular biochemical  networks as well as brain-wide neural networks can also be examined.  At the Allen Institute and at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, we have been collaboratively  analyzing the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) adult mouse brain data set, and preliminary results  demonstrate that the spatial co-expression patterns of genes are indeed a rich source of  information. In this proposal, we intend to focus this analysis on addiction-related gene sets, in  consultation with experts on addiction research and integrating relevant online information  resources. Specific aims in the first year (R21 phase) include (1) development and refinement of  software and web-based tools for analysis of co-expression patterns in gene sets and (2)  multivariate analysis of an initial set of addiction related genes. The first year will focus on the  adult mouse brain data set that is already at hand. In subsequent years (years 2-4, R33 phase), we  will extend the co-expression analysis to mouse developmental and spinal cord data sets (Aim 1),  and human brain data sets (Aim 2), that are scheduled to become available during this period.  Additionally, we will mine existing databases and the literature to augment our initial gene lists  as well as to develop a database of associations between substance abuse phenotypes and  corresponding brain areas (Aim 3). This will allow us to more fully analyze the intra and  intercellular networks that may be involved in addiction. Finally, we will make the  computational tools and analysis results developed as part of our research publicly available in  the form of a web portal (aim 4). Project Narrative  The identification of genes and gene networks driving drug abuse and addiction is a major  current challenge in addiction genetics.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

The goal is to define key abnormalities in pathways critical for learning and memory and to identify effective targets for development of potential therapeutics.          n/a",Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome,8066269,R01HD056235,"['1 year old', '1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcineurin Pathway', 'Calcineurin inhibitor', 'Cell membrane', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Down Syndrome', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human Chromosomes', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memantine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentylenetetrazole', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Protein Array', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trisomy', 'United States', 'Validation', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'familial Alzheimer disease', 'gene function', 'intersectin 1', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'mouse Ts1Cje', 'mouse Ts65Dn', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'postnatal', 'public health relevance', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'receptor', 'response', 'social', 'synaptojanin', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'time interval']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2010,99944,0.09940964
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.",Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders,8860253,R01NS076465,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Betaine', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Cancer Biology', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Folic Acid', 'Food Supply', 'Fortified Food', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knockout Mice', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Tube Closure', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Neural tube', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'folate-binding protein', 'folic acid metabolism', 'fortification', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'man', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'neonate', 'neurogenetics', 'peripheral blood', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'response', 'risk variant', 'standard of care', 'stem', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2015,872134,0.096830295

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes.

"A Molecular Investigation of Growth and Shape Variation in Cleft-Lip Etiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to experimentally assess a model of cleft-lip (CL) formation in which variation in midfacial cell proliferation (growth rate) affects the shape of the face and the incidence of CL in a predictable manner. The A/WySn strain mouse is a common model of human CL and has an increased incidence of facial clefting (20-25%) due to a defect in Wnt9b expression. Evidence suggests that members of the Wntsignaling pathway regulate cell proliferation in embryonic midfacial tissues during a critical period of facial outgrowth and fusion. Previous research on midfacial morphogenesis indicates that compared to normal mice the A/WySn strain has a normal-sized head but that the midfacial prominences are abnormally shaped and exhibit retarded growth. These findings implicate disruptions of Wnt-mediated regulation of midfacial cell proliferation as a causal factor in the etiology of non-syndromic CL. Here we propose to investigate the relationship of growth rate to midfacial shape and CL formation by first experimentally inducing variance in cell proliferation using retroviral expression of a Wnt-antagonist, Dkk1, and then comparing midfacial shape variation between groups using advanced landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Prior to facial formation (E9.5), embryos of both normal and A/WySn strain mice will be infected with an adenovirus expressing Dkk1 protein. Because Wnt-responsive cells are active primarily in the facial prominences, disruption of cell growth will affect only those regions involved in CL formation while leaving other regions of the head unaffected (e.g., brain growth). The model proposed here predicts that variation in midfacial growth will result in an axis of continuous shape change that is correlated with increased incidence of CL formation and bilateral trait expression. This hypothesis will be tested by quantifying and comparing the shape of the midface in infected mice with that of both uninfected controls and A/WySn mice at E12.5. Support for this model would indicate that the variance induced by genetic perturbations of cell proliferation are ontologically as important to the etiology of CL as the specific genes involved. For medical researchers, this model would help to link the effect of novel genetic or environmental disruptions of cell proliferation to a predictable phenotypic outcome.      This study proposes to explore the role of variation in growth to both the shape of the face and the incidence of cleft lip formation, a common birth defect in humans. This research will enable doctors to better predict the effect of genetic mutations to growth on morphological outcomes like CL.

"Imaging and stimulation of neural activity at cellular resolution in awake mice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to develop methods and instrumentation for the simultaneous imaging and optical stimulation of activity in large populations of neurons in the awake mouse brain under conditions in which the mouse is free to navigate in a virtual environment, a capability with wide application in systems neuroscience. The enabling technology is an apparatus that facilitates high-resolution optical imaging at cellular resolution while minimizing brain motion. It is based on an upright table mounted two-photon microscope mounted over a spherical treadmill consisting of a large air supported ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows designed to reduce brain motion, can walk and run on the surface of the ball during imaging while their head remains motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that movement-associated brain motion is limited to ~2-5 um and that this motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, providing the conditions for an offline Hidden Markov Model based software method for removing residual motion artifacts. Pilot data using a first generation instrument demonstrate that behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations can be routinely imaged at cellular resolution in awake mice, even during walking and running. The proposed research and development program will further validate and optimize the methods used in the first generation instrument, and extend its capabilities by adding real-time motion correction, new chambers and lenses for imaging of deeper brain structures such as the hippocampus, and the incorporation of a visual virtual reality display system controlled by the running behavior of the mouse. An additional thrust will focus on using pulse time-multiplexing and a multi-focal plane optical design to provide simultaneous imaging and two-photon based photo-stimulation using channelrhodopsin. The scientific questions in systems neuroscience that can be addressed using the instrumentation to be developed are some of the most fundamental ones about how the brain works, ranging from determining the number of active, versus silent, neurons during a specific behavior, to the importance of synchrony and correlation in perception, memory, and motor control. The ability to image the activity in entire populations of neurons at cellular resolution in mice navigating in a virtual environment will facilitate mapping the micron-scale spatial architecture and circuit connectivity of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the cortex. This study will develop an imaging method to measure the chemical processes in many individual neurons simultaneously in the brain while it is operating in the awake state.

Pilot data using a first generation instrument demonstrate that behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations can be routinely imaged at cellular resolution in awake mice, even during walking and running. The proposed research and development program will further validate and optimize the methods used in the first generation instrument, and extend its capabilities by adding real-time motion correction, new chambers and lenses for imaging of deeper brain structures such as the hippocampus, and the incorporation of a visual virtual reality display system controlled by the running behavior of the mouse. An additional thrust will focus on using pulse time-multiplexing and a multi-focal plane optical design to provide simultaneous imaging and two-photon based photo-stimulation using channelrhodopsin. The scientific questions in systems neuroscience that can be addressed using the instrumentation to be developed are some of the most fundamental ones about how the brain works, ranging from determining the number of active, versus silent, neurons during a specific behavior, to the importance of synchrony and correlation in perception, memory, and motor control. The ability to image the activity in entire populations of neurons at cellular resolution in mice navigating in a virtual environment will facilitate mapping the micron-scale spatial architecture and circuit connectivity of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the cortex. This study will develop an imaging method to measure the chemical processes in many individual neurons simultaneously in the brain while it is operating in the awake state. This capability would be valuable in comparing normal and diseased states in the brain.

"Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett Syndrome ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in women. Individuals with RTT develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  as  well  as  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech  start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the X-­linked transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2 (MECP2) occur in >95% of RTT cases. Initially, MeCP2 deficiency in neurons was considered as the exclusive  cause of RTT, but recent studies have revealed that glial cells lacking functional MeCP2 also have a significant  pathological role in RTT etiology. However, specific cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction underlying this  role  or  its  behavioral  consequences  have  not  been  identified.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution of a specific glial subtype, astrocytes, to the dysfunction of the striatum responsible for motor deficits  in  a  Mecp2-­based  mouse  model  for  RTT.  Astrocytes  expressing  the  Slc1a2  gene  encoding  glutamate  transporter-­1 (GLT-­1, also EAAT2) have a pivotal role in regulating extracellular glutamate levels. We propose  to characterize the contribution of GLT-­1 dysfunction to glutamate signaling in conditional knockout (cKO) mice  lacking  Mecp2  only  in  astrocytes  using  a  combination  of  experimental  approaches,  including  whole-­cell  intracellular  recordings  and  optogenetics  in  striatal  slices,  time-­lapse  imaging  of  intracellular  Ca2+  and  extracellular glutamate and dopamine, near-­super resolution confocal microscopy, and quantitative behavioral  assessments  using  machine-­learning  classifiers.  Our  preliminary  results  indicate  lower  expression  levels  of  Slc1a2 in the striatum of constitutive Mecp2 KO mice, consistent with smaller GLT-­1-­mediated intracellular Na+  signals  and  membrane  currents  in  striatal  astrocytes.  Intriguingly,  Mecp2  cKO  mice  show  higher  locomotor  activity  in  the  open  field  test.  We  also  present  preliminary  evidence  of  the  role  of  GLT-­1  in  modulating  extracellular  glutamate  levels,  intracellular  Ca2+  dynamics  in  astrocytes,  and  dopamine  release  from  dopaminergic  terminals.  Based  on  prior  work  and  these  preliminary  results,  we  hypothesize  that  astroglial  glutamate  signaling  in  the  striatum  is  impaired  in  Mecp2  deficient  mice  and  contributes  to  their  motor  deficits.  We  propose  two  Specific  Aims:  (1)  Identify  and  characterize  the  cellular  consequences  of  GLT-­1  dysfunction in cKO mice lacking Mecp2 in astrocytes, and (2) Characterize neuronal network activity and  striatum-­related  behaviors  in  cKO  mice  lacking Mecp2  in  astrocytes.  The  proposed  studies  will  elucidate  the consequences of MeCP2 loss in astrocyte GLT-­1 function on striatum-­dependent behaviors, which will have  broad implications not only for RTT but also for other brain disorders associated with striatal dysfunction.    PROJECT NARRATIVE  Rett  syndrome  (RTT),  caused  by  MECP2  mutations,  results  from  impaired  function  of  neurons  and  glial  cells  responsible for proper sensory integration and motor control. As a major glial cell type, astrocytes play a major  role  in  regulating  glutamate  homeostasis.  In  this  application,  we  will  define  the  role  of  MeCP2  in  astrocytes  of  the striatum by characterizing the cellular and behavioral consequences of its conditional cell-­specific deletion  on astroglial glutamate and dopamine signaling, the function of cortical inputs, and striatum-­related behaviors.   ",Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL).

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements.

These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,387714,0.071458688
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology.

"Predicting Gene Structure--Vertebrate Genome Comparison   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A steadily increasing proportion of             biomedical research is conducted on organisms for which genomic sequence is          available. For many research questions, however, a genome is important               primarily because of its protein products. Thus, a critical question in genome       analysis is: What are the structures of all the genes and the exact amino acid       sequences of their translation products? Despite significant contributions from      experimental biology, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics, we are         still far from being able to answer this question accurately.                                                                                                             The proposed research aims to improve gene-structure prediction by exploiting        patterns of evolutionary conservation.                                                                                                                                    Aim 1 focuses on developing probability models for exploiting genomic homology       to improve gene-structure prediction. A novel aspect of the proposed models is       their use of ""conservation sequence"" to represent the degree and pattern of          evolutionary conservation at each nucleotide in the genome to be annotated. A        conservation sequence is a synthesis of potentially overlapping local                alignments into one sequence. Our probability models build on the Hidden Markov      Model (HMM) approach used in state-of-the-art gene-structure prediction              systems.                                                                                                                                                                  Aim 2 focuses on developing probability models for improving gene prediction by      exploiting cDNA and EST alignments. The fundamental approach is similar to that      of Aim 1. The most important new question is how to combine information from         transcript alignments with information from genomic homology in a way that does      not count the same evidence twice.                                                                                                                                        Aim 3 focuses on analysis of vertebrate genomes using homology from multiple         vertebrate genomes. The best method is expected to depend on the evolutionary        distances among the genomes. Our investigations will focus on gene-structure         prediction in human, with homology provided by (a) both mouse and pufferfish,        and (b) both mouse and rat.

"ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS OF POLYOMA VIRUS Polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates will be studied by low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis to answer questions about their overall structure, assembly and stability.  Polyoma, a small DNA-containing virus, closely related to SV-40, causes transformation of embryonic or immunologically deficient mouse cells.  We have recently discovered (Rayment, Baker, Caspar and Murakami (1982) Nature 295, 110-115) that the virus capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres rather than 12 pentamers and 60 hexamers as predicted by the Caspar-Klug quasi-equivalence theory of subunit assembly.  This unexpected result prompts us to examine the packing and bonding specificity of the capsomeres in several polymorphic aggregates of polyoma using low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis.  These methods are the most powerful way to study biological aggregates which have not been crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction.  The molecular weights of intact virions and capsids will be determined using scanning transmission electron microscopy to provide an independent measure of the number of copies of VP1, the major coat protein.  Electron microscopy studies of positive and negatively-stained provirion complex samples will be initiated to directly observe the nucleocapsid structure and correlate with studies on intact virions, empty capsids and isolated minichromosomes.  n/a",ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS OF POLYOMA VIRUS,3282396,R01GM033050,"['DNA virus', ' Polyomavirus muris 1', ' X ray crystallography', ' X ray microscopy', ' artificial intelligence', ' chemical aggregate', ' molecular weight', ' provirus', ' scanning electron microscopy', ' tissue /cell culture', ' virus assembly', ' virus envelope']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,1985,70396,0.068695924
"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9985087,R01CA218664,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Greater sac of peritoneum', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Mucinous', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Ovarian', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Reproductive system', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serous', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'data fusion', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'ion mobility', 'ionization', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'uncertain malignant potential neoplasm']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,410432,0.066219811

"Transcriptional Profiling in Diabetic Nephropathy.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Renal injury triggers complicated molecular, cellular, and physiological responses difficult to study using conventional technology. Transcription profiling - a genome-scale determination of gene expression - is a promising new technology that might allow us to obtain quantitative information about the complex transcription profiles (i.e., transcriptome) that underlie renal failure. We will use high-density microarrays to map glomerular gene expression in a murine model of diabetic nephropathy. Specif¿c Aim 1 will map expression of>l 1,000 genes in freshly isolated glomeruli from db/db mice. We chose the db/db mouse model because it develops progressive renal insufficiency with features of type II diabetic nephropathy in humans. The gene expression profile will be constructed at an early stage when mice are hyperglycemic, but with little evidence of renal injury, and at a later stage characterized by overt diabetic nephropathy. In addition to identifying known and unknown genes differentially regulated in diabetic renal injury, we will used unsupervised and supervised learning tools to gain biological insight into the gene expression profiles. Specific Aim 2 will identify candidate genes linked to diabetic nephropathy by treating db/db mice with an angiotensin (ANG 11)-converting enzyme inhibitor, an anti-transforming growth factor Beta (TGFBeta) antibody, and both therapies combined. Aim 2 will thus identify transcription profiles altered by blocking ANG II and TGFBeta. These experiments will also discover genes altered in diabetes that are not affected by therapy and thus possibly linked to diabetic glomeruloscierosis.

"Susceptibility Genes and Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The study of genes that influence cancer susceptibility is a rapidly evolving field. This proposal is focused on identifying and characterizing novel modifier loci that influence the development of cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The system we have chosen involves the tumor suppressor gene, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC). Mutations in APC cause inherited and sporadic colorectal cancers. ApcMin mice have a mutation in the homologue of the APC gene and develop multiple adenomas throughout their small and large intestines. QTL studies identified a locus, Modifier of Min (Mom 1), that dramatically modifies ApcMin-induced tumor number and size. We and others have reported that the secretory type II Phospholipase A2 (Pla2g2a) gene is responsible for at least a part of the Mom1 phenotype. While it was clear that other modifier loci are present, they were unable to be identified due to segregation of the Mom1 locus in these crosses. To further dissect genetic modifier pathways, we constructed reciprocal congenic strains by exchanging the Mom1 region between C57BL6/J and C3H/HeJ mice. These strains resulted in the usually susceptible B6 mice containinga resistant Mom1 allele and similarly, the resistant C3H mice containing a susceptible Mom1 locus. QTL analysis has now revealed the presence of 5 novel modifier regions. We propose to isolate and characterize the most potent modifiers identified between the B6-C3H reciprocal congenic strains. We will develop congenic resources to study the action of the new Mom# loci. In addition, we will refine the genetic location of each Mom# locus, using positional and candidate gene approaches to identify the gene(s) responsible for Mom# phenotypes. Finally, we will perform several biological assays to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Mom# function. The studies outlined here will ultimately lead to insights regarding the predictive value of these modifier genes in tumor prevention and response to treatment, as well as provide avenues for novel chemopreventive agents. We believe that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"". Our research is designed to find factors that can predict which people are at-risk for developing colorectal cancer. By studying these factors, we hope to be able to develop new ways to help prevent cancers from developing in the first place.           n/a",Susceptibility Genes and Colorectal Cancer,8072017,R01CA120243,"['APC gene', 'Adenomatous Polyposis Coli', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Backcrossings', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'C3H/HeJ Mouse', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Code', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Congenic Strain', 'DNA Sequence', 'Development', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Targeting', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Inbred C3H Mice', 'Inbred Strain', 'Inherited', 'Intestinal Cancer', 'Investigation', 'Large Intestine', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Northern Blotting', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Polyps', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Intestines', 'Staging', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Variant', 'adenoma', 'congenic', 'design', 'genome database', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'offspring', 'phospholipase A2-II', 'positional cloning', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'text searching', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,285665,0.059614314

"Susceptibility Genes and Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The study of genes that influence cancer susceptibility is a rapidly evolving field. This proposal is focused on identifying and characterizing novel modifier loci that influence the development of cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The system we have chosen involves the tumor suppressor gene, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC). Mutations in APC cause inherited and sporadic colorectal cancers. ApcMin mice have a mutation in the homologue of the APC gene and develop multiple adenomas throughout their small and large intestines. QTL studies identified a locus, Modifier of Min (Mom 1), that dramatically modifies ApcMin-induced tumor number and size. We and others have reported that the secretory type II Phospholipase A2 (Pla2g2a) gene is responsible for at least a part of the Mom1 phenotype. While it was clear that other modifier loci are present, they were unable to be identified due to segregation of the Mom1 locus in these crosses. To further dissect genetic modifier pathways, we constructed reciprocal congenic strains by exchanging the Mom1 region between C57BL6/J and C3H/HeJ mice. These strains resulted in the usually susceptible B6 mice containinga resistant Mom1 allele and similarly, the resistant C3H mice containing a susceptible Mom1 locus. QTL analysis has now revealed the presence of 5 novel modifier regions. We propose to isolate and characterize the most potent modifiers identified between the B6-C3H reciprocal congenic strains. We will develop congenic resources to study the action of the new Mom# loci. In addition, we will refine the genetic location of each Mom# locus, using positional and candidate gene approaches to identify the gene(s) responsible for Mom# phenotypes. Finally, we will perform several biological assays to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Mom# function. The studies outlined here will ultimately lead to insights regarding the predictive value of these modifier genes in tumor prevention and response to treatment, as well as provide avenues for novel chemopreventive agents.

"Intelligent Microtome Instrumentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Locating fluorescently-tagged cells in whole organisms is important to the development of gene therapy, stem cell therapy delivery methods, and for drug research. This project will develop an intelligent microtome to identify fluorescently labeled cells in whole mice and to collect those cells in thin sections. During Phase I, a small-mammal cryomicrotome with LED-based tissue illumination for fluorescence imaging will be constructed. Several CCD cameras will be evaluated to establish the spatial resolution and gray-scale resolution needed to provide necessary fluorescence-imaging capabilities for the instrument. The instrument will be tested on isolated muscle, tissue homogenates containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled cells, and on whole mice. The cells expressing GFP in these samples will provide data for the development of next-generation instrumentation during Phase II.       Phase II will add capabilities to use the fluorescence image data to intelligently acquire thin sections only when fluorescent cells are detected. Fluorescence images acquired during sectioning will provide morphological guides to identify and isolate the same cells in mounted sections by laser-capture microdissection. Automated thin-tissue acquisition will be an added capability and will be integrated with intelligent fluorescence analysis to produce a completely automated instrument. The instrument will allow processing of whole animals to obtain thin sections for laser dissection and for biochemical and/or PCR post processing of select tissue regions.           n/a",Intelligent Microtome Instrumentation,7154878,R43HL086267,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment', 'biomedical equipment development', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'digital imaging', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'genetically modified animals', 'green fluorescent proteins', 'laboratory mouse', 'molecular /cellular imaging', 'muscle', 'muscular dystrophy', 'phantom model', 'sectioning', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,"BARLOW SCIENTIFIC, INC.",R43,2006,100000,0.058158924
"Genetic and Morphometric Analysis of Facial Clefts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cleft lip (CL) or Cleft lip/palate (CL/P) occurs in about 1 in 700 live births, and while they are treatable, many individuals with these types of deformities will require lifelong care. Both of these conditions are the result of failures of the facial prominences to fuse during embryogenesis. CL and CL/P can occur as a single deformity or as part of a syndrome. Branchio-Occulo-Facial Syndrome (BOFS), for example, presents with facial clefting, ear and eye deformities and has been linked to mutations in the gene TFAP2A, encoding transcription factor AP-2¿. One mouse model of this disease employs a null allele in combination with a hypomorphic or ""weak"" allele of AP-2¿, creating a partial loss of AP-2¿ function. These mice develop a fully penetrant bilateral CL/P and our preliminary data suggest that it is small changes in growth and/or morphogenesis of the facial prominences that are responsible for failed fusion. Molecular analysis of this model shows increased expression of genes involved in Fgf signaling. Further, the loss of a single fgf8 allele in these mice is able to  partially rescue the bilateral CL/P seen in the AP-2¿ hypomorphic mice to a unilateral CL/P. I, therefore hypothesize that AP-2¿ and FGF8 are elements of the same pathway during normal facial development and loss or mutation of AP-2¿ can affect the signaling interactions required for facial development. We will test this hypothesis by examining shape, gene expression and function in a mouse model that overexpresses FGF8 in the facial ectoderm and comparing this model to our AP-2 model. This proposal will generate shape data using 3D imaging and morphometrics. With this data we will be able to compare shape between the FGF8 overexpression model to the AP-2¿ hypomorphic mutation model and determine if these two genes are affecting development in the same manner during development. The gene expression data will allow us to 1) correlate shape change with gene expression, cell proliferation and death changes, allowing identification of pathways and mechanisms that may be causative of the growth changes. 2) The expression data will allow comparison of the two models on a molecular level to determine if they are affecting the same downstream targets, and thus, acting within the same pathway. Based on this data, we hope be able to build out how this pathway is interacting with other established facial development pathways to determine the overall facial gene regulatory network for facial development.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging.

"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,9813516,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37351,0.05070788
"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,0.048550986
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models.

"Molecular Studies of Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of children, caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and the resulting accumulation of heparan sulfate. The disease, which is chronic and progressive, is characterized by profound mental retardation and eventual dementia, with death usually in the late teens. There currently is no effective treatment. We previously developed a mouse model by targeted disruption of the Naglu gene in order to study this catastrophic disease. Activated microglia and astrocytes are present throughout the brain, starting at 1 month of age. However, immunohistochemistry has shown that certain neuronal changes are focal, with neurons in a few areas showing a constellation of secondary abnormalities in addition to the expected storage of glycosaminoglycan. One such area (designated as ""vulnerable"") is the medial entorhinal cortex. In Specific Aim 1, we will use microarray technology to identify changes in gene expression that are specific to neurons in the ""vulnerable"" area of the mutant mouse brain. Using laser capture microdissection, we will obtain 500 -700 neurons from the medial entorhinal cortex of the mutant mice at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and process total RNA for hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays representing the entire mouse genome. The feasibility of this procedure has been demonstrated in a preliminary experiment. Neurons will also be dissected from a ""less vulnerable"" area of the brain, which does not show the secondary abnormalities (e.g., the lateral entorhinal cortex). Neurons from the two areas in each of 4 mutant mice of each age will be compared to each other as well as to neurons from corresponding areas of brain from control mice. Transcripts specific to neurons in the ""vulnerable"" area of the mutant mouse brain will be confirmed by independent methods such as in situ hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for the corresponding proteins. This phase of the study is expected to uncover changes in gene expression that may underlie the selective vulnerability of certain neurons. In specific aim 2, we will explore the significance and consequences of some of these changes. The changes of interest would be those involved in, e.g., signal transduction, organelle traffic, cell adhesion, and other important cellular processes. While the generation of hypotheses for this Specific Aim must await data obtained from microarray analyses, we used a finding in the feasibility experiment (a 7-fold increase of lysozyme transcript) as an example of how we would proceed from microarray data to a hypothesis for the significance of the elevated transcript. The purpose of these studies is to better understand the role of the secondary abnormalities in altering molecular and biochemical pathways in the Sanfilippo type B brain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Sanfilippo Syndrome type B is a rare but catastrophic neurodegenerative disorder of children, which can be studied in a mouse model.

"Molecular Studies of Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of children, caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and the resulting accumulation of heparan sulfate. The disease, which is chronic and progressive, is characterized by profound mental retardation and eventual dementia, with death usually in the late teens. There currently is no effective treatment. We previously developed a mouse model by targeted disruption of the Naglu gene in order to study this catastrophic disease. Activated microglia and astrocytes are present throughout the brain, starting at 1 month of age. However, immunohistochemistry has shown that certain neuronal changes are focal, with neurons in a few areas showing a constellation of secondary abnormalities in addition to the expected storage of glycosaminoglycan. One such area (designated as ""vulnerable"") is the medial entorhinal cortex. In Specific Aim 1, we will use microarray technology to identify changes in gene expression that are specific to neurons in the ""vulnerable"" area of the mutant mouse brain. Using laser capture microdissection, we will obtain 500 -700 neurons from the medial entorhinal cortex of the mutant mice at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and process total RNA for hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays representing the entire mouse genome. The feasibility of this procedure has been demonstrated in a preliminary experiment. Neurons will also be dissected from a ""less vulnerable"" area of the brain, which does not show the secondary abnormalities (e.g., the lateral entorhinal cortex). Neurons from the two areas in each of 4 mutant mice of each age will be compared to each other as well as to neurons from corresponding areas of brain from control mice. Transcripts specific to neurons in the ""vulnerable"" area of the mutant mouse brain will be confirmed by independent methods such as in situ hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for the corresponding proteins. This phase of the study is expected to uncover changes in gene expression that may underlie the selective vulnerability of certain neurons. In specific aim 2, we will explore the significance and consequences of some of these changes. The changes of interest would be those involved in, e.g., signal transduction, organelle traffic, cell adhesion, and other important cellular processes. While the generation of hypotheses for this Specific Aim must await data obtained from microarray analyses, we used a finding in the feasibility experiment (a 7-fold increase of lysozyme transcript) as an example of how we would proceed from microarray data to a hypothesis for the significance of the elevated transcript. The purpose of these studies is to better understand the role of the secondary abnormalities in altering molecular and biochemical pathways in the Sanfilippo type B brain.

"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10045024,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2020,1069526,0.04011753
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects.

Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.                ",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,8623176,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,573774,0.035233563
"Transcriptome Atlases of the Craniofacial Sutures ABSTRACT Craniofacial sutures are fibrous joints between bones of the skull. Within them, osteoblasts differentiate at the borders of a central suture mesenchyme and are incorporated into growing bone at osteogenic fronts in the highly regulated process of osteogenesis. Skull function requires that sutures: 1) form properly during embryogenesis, 2) allow rapid pre- and postnatal growth, and 3) serve as shock absorbers to dissipate damaging mechanical forces and as reservoirs for stem cells to maintain and repair bone. Mutations in a variety of genes, including signaling pathway components and transcription factors, cause various forms of craniosynostosis (CS). In CS, sutures fuse prematurely, preventing the coordinated growth of the skull and brain. Significant surgical intervention is required to prevent the deleterious neurological consequences of raised intracranial pressure. The wide variation between sutures in terms of form, function, and susceptibility to fusion suggests that gene expression profiles vary considerably among sutures. The currently funded, parent grant “Transcriptome Atlases of the Craniofacial Sutures” (U01 DE024448-03) addresses this issue. Laser capture microdissection of the separate osteogenic front and suture mesenchyme subregions is being undertaken for up to 11 sutures in wild type mice and in 2 CS mouse models, at different embryonic ages, to create RNA-Seq libraries. However, the expression patterns of genes regulating suture formation and osteogenesis also indicate the presence of cell subpopulations within the osteogenic fronts and suture mesenchyme. Accurate identification of these subpopulations would reveal the patterns of signaling pathway and transcription factor interactions regulating suture patency and osteogenesis. The parent project, by using bulk cell RNA extraction that homogenizes RNA expression within each suture subregion, cannot reveal this organization. This Competitive Revision proposal aims to address this deficit and significantly expand our knowledge of suture biology by providing the means to identify cell subpopulations within the subregions of the wild type murine suture. In this new Specific Aim 4, droplet-based single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) will be performed on 4 major cranial sutures (coronal, sagittal, interfrontal and lambdoid), at 3 stages of development (late embryogenesis (E18.5), rapid postnatal growth (P10) and post-weaning maintenance (P28)) to obtain a minimum of 1,000 scRNA-Seq libraries per suture at a given time point. Collections of curated, quality- controlled, scRNA-Seq files will be provided to the FaceBase Hub for use by the wider scientific research community. Analysis of the expression profiles of individual cells will allow the identification of suture cell subpopulations, and elucidate how the various signaling systems, their effectors and readouts are organized and synthesized to regulate suture patency, osteogenesis and other functions at distinct periods of mammalian life. They will provide the basis for new hypotheses of suture formation, maintenance, and function, and provide insight into suture pathologies, with wider significance for bone development in general. NARRATIVE The development of the skull is a complex process involving differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts within the sutures between bones. This proposal will identify the individual cell subpopulations involved in this differentiation process by gene expression profiling of single cells isolated from sutures at different stages of normal mouse development, using single cell RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis. Identifying these distinct subpopulations will open new avenues of research to accelerate our understanding of normal craniofacial development, craniosynostosis and other craniofacial diseases.",Transcriptome Atlases of the Craniofacial Sutures,9318737,U01DE024448,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Bone Development', 'Bone Growth', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Brain', 'Calvaria', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromium', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysostoses', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emulsions', 'Expression Library', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Gel', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Process', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mesenchymal Differentiation', 'Mesenchyme', 'Metadata', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Shock', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'Suspensions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bone', 'cDNA Library', 'cell type', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'extracellular', 'insight', 'laser capture microdissection', 'mechanical force', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'osteoprogenitor cell', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reference genome', 'suture fusion', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2017,423180,0.035174543
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives.

This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,0.03376633
"Genetic Architecture of the Mammalian (Canid) Skeleton DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As its goal, this project seeks to decipher the genetic architecture underlying the mammalian skeletal system. We use a population of Portuguese Water (PW) Dogs, descended from a few founders and characterized by frequent inbreeding events. This unstructured pedigreed population is similar to human isolates such as the Hutterites or larger well documented populations such as the Mormons. Dogs are genotyped using microsatellite markers and phenotyped from five x-rays comprising the skull, fore- and hind limbs and pelvis. From this information it has been possible to identify QTLs (haplotypes of Quantitative Trait Loci) that inform the skeleton. During the first 2+ years of the project, we have used Principal Component Analysis to define groupings of skeletal metrics that represent functional trade-offs between adaptations for power or speed (e.g. skull vs. post cranial body, limb width vs. length, pelvis size vs. limb width) and have identified genetic loci that regulate these groupings. Loci also have been identified that regulate variation in the right vs. the left hip joints (bilateral asymmetry); and an interaction between QTLs affecting size has been identified that, in part, explains sexual dimorphism.

"Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and, through its efferent projections, also contributes to other cognitive tasks. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of autism propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors. A deficit in social interaction is one of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, which includes Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice causes social behavior impairments reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders. The ventral hippocampus (vHIP) of Mecp2 knockout mice (KO) mice is hyperactive due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, which results in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize the influence of the vHIP on the activity of the mPFC through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection, testing whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and social interaction deficits. We hypothesize that hyperactive hippocampal afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance, which contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function and role in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and behavioral assessments. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (2) characterize synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (3) test if chemogenetic modulation of vHIP activity restores mPFC network activity and social behaviors in Mecp2 KO mice. In addition to defining novel pathophysiological mechanisms of RTT, these studies will provide fundamental information regarding the functional and structural properties of the long-range monosynaptic connection between the vHIP and mPFC in typically developing brains. Thus, the impact of this work will extend beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is thought to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome,9650793,R56NS103089,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal', 'response', 'social', 'spatial memory', 'synaptic function', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R56,2018,457549,0.03056246
"Assessing Novel Rexinoids Developed by Comparative Bioresponse Analysis in an Innovative Mouse Model of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma Project Summary Bexarotene is a potent and selective retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist (rexinoid) that is FDA-approved as an oral antineoplastic drug for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), but has also been explored in the treatment of other cancers. However, bexarotene only has ~45% response rate as a systemic therapy in later stages of CTCL, and while the response rate appears to improve at higher doses, there are dose-limiting toxicities associated with treatment. We propose to employ rational drug design to synthesize ~50 novel rexinoids (1-21 and 52-80 in the Research Plan) which display unique RXR binding properties that may render these analogs superior in biological potency and specificity, compared to bexarotene, as treatments for CTCL. Previously, we synthesized a panel of unique rexinoids with a variety of characteristics, including some analogs with superior efficacy and less severe side-effects relative to bexarotene. Utilizing our knowledge-base of previous rexinoids developed, tested, and validated by our group, we propose to synthesize a new suite of compounds which will be tested in a series of assays that contribute to a Biopotency Index Analysis (BIA) score. The BIA has been used to rank some of our existing compounds, and the ~50 new analogs we propose to develop are based on the structures of rexinoids with the highest BIA values. The BIA score is composed of several components that can be benchmarked to bexarotene or other target rexinoids (e.g.,NEt-TMN), including EC50 value, RXRE activation, modulation of anti-cancer gene expression, apoptotic effects, and anti-proliferative potency. The ~50 new analogs will be tested to assign BIA values. To determine RXR activation, we will assess each analog in a comprehensive panel of bioassays. We will first test the proposed rexinoid molecules in RXR yeast and mammalian two hybrid assays, as well as DNA-based (RXRE) assays to screen for RXR homodimer binding. Those analogs that display RXR binding/homodimerization will be further evaluated via testing of their modulation of anti-cancer genes (COX-2, DEPP, DEC2, IGFPD-6, etc.) and apoptotic genes (HDAC1, IkK, BIRC- 5, BO, etc.). The ~50 new rexinoids will also be assessed in apoptosis and proliferation assays in patient-derived CTCL cell lines (e.g., Hut78). The 3 rexinoids with the best BIA profiles will then be scaled up for testing in a novel mouse model of CTCL versus bexarotene and a vehicle control. Using interleukin-15 transgenic (IL-15tg) mice, we will determine the in vivo safety, tolerability and efficacy of selected rexinoids in CTCL. IL-15tg mice exhibit features of human CTCL, namely, cutaneous lesions characterized by erythematous plaques/patches, erythroderma, and pruritus compared to wild-type controls. Collectively, this approach will allow us to synthesize ~50 additional RXR agonists that may exhibit superior gene expression profiles that drive anti-cancer pathways in CTCL and then to validate this with in vitro and in vivo CTCL models. Our interdisciplinary and student- centered approach integrates medicinal chemistry, modeling, and a suite of biological assays to amplify our successful strategy of creating novel rexinoid pharmacotherapies suitable for clinical translation. Project Narrative: Relevance Bexarotene, a retinoid X receptor (RXR) selective agonist, is an FDA-approved drug for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) that has also been shown to modulate anti-cancer genes through RXR-directed pathways. This research proposes the synthesis and biological analysis of ~50 new RXR agonists (rexinoids) in order to develop more potent compounds with potential to treat CTCL, particularly in later stages where bexarotene only has an ~45% response rate. Utilizing our successful track record of synthesizing novel and potent rexinoids and elucidating their ligand binding, receptor activation and gene expression profiles, we will identify candidate rexinoids with the potential to further contribute to differential regulation of anti-cancer pathways with improved capacity to drive apoptosis in human CTCL cell lines and exert enhanced therapeutic effects in a mouse model of CTCL.",Assessing Novel Rexinoids Developed by Comparative Bioresponse Analysis in an Innovative Mouse Model of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma,9965086,R15CA249617,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Benchmarking', 'Bexarotene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'DNA', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Exfoliative Dermatitis', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HDAC1 gene', 'Homodimerization', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immersion', 'In Vitro', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Interleukin-15', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lymphoma cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mus', 'Oncogenes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'Pruritus', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'RXR', 'RXRA gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Gene', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Yeasts', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'appropriate dose', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'compare effectiveness', 'design', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scale up', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'student-centered approach', 'survivin', 'synergism', 'undergraduate research', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NCI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R15,2020,484166,0.03042364
"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.027606664
"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results.

"Functional genomics to identify miRNA targets in the developing face DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial developmental defects are common, affecting about 1 in 100 human infants, with high financial and human costs. By better understanding the mechanisms of facial development, we hope to develop better prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies. FaceBase currently houses high-throughput data on promoters, transcripts and microRNAs (miRs) that are used in mouse facial development. To effectively use these data to understand the genetic programs, the cellular interactions, and hence the mechanisms underlying morphogenesis of the face, they must be integrated amongst themselves and with more general knowledge. microRNAs (miRNAs) are an important component of genetic programs and have critical roles in facial development. They generally act through down-regulating target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The average miRNA targets over 200 mRNAs, and many mRNAs are regulated by multiple miRNAs.

"Functional genomics to identify miRNA targets in the developing face     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial developmental defects are common, affecting about 1 in 100 human infants, with high financial and human costs. By better understanding the mechanisms of facial development, we hope to develop better prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies. FaceBase currently houses high-throughput data on promoters, transcripts and microRNAs (miRs) that are used in mouse facial development. To effectively use these data to understand the genetic programs, the cellular interactions, and hence the mechanisms underlying morphogenesis of the face, they must be integrated amongst themselves and with more general knowledge. microRNAs (miRNAs) are an important component of genetic programs and have critical roles in facial development. They generally act through down-regulating target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The average miRNA targets over 200 mRNAs, and many mRNAs are regulated by multiple miRNAs. The targets of a given miRNA are generally functionally related, so miRNAs regulate biological functions as well as of individual genes. The challenge for genomic-level miRNA studies is to identify the individual genes and biological functions that are targeted by each miRNA. This proposal utilizes existing mRNA and miRNA expression data from the developing mouse face and integrates it with functional genomics knowledge to provide a systems-level view of the role(s) of miRNAs in facial development. The computational approach is based on the hypothesis that miRNAs orchestrate genetic programs for cell fate and/or differentiation through coordinated regulation of suites of functionally related genes.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes.

"Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity PROJECT SUMMARY Dexterous food-handling is a critical but still poorly understood type of basic motor behavior. We propose an exploratory research program to investigate how the mouse uses its digits and forepaws to dexterously handle food. Preliminary results suggest that mouse food-handling movements, despite appearing extremely complex, can be decomposed into several types of simpler elements, tentatively identified as distinct and very rapid submovements that exhibit partly stereotyped and partly variable kinematic features. They also suggest that the mouse’s thumb (first digit, or D1; pollex) plays a surprisingly large and previously unrecognized role in dexterous food-handling. To explore these hypotheses and observations, we will first develop an approach for quantitatively characterizing seed-handling behaviors of freely moving mice. For this we will use high-speed, close-up video capture, combined with deep neural network methods for automated markerless tracking (DeepLabCut). We will then develop a novel trial-based paradigm for characterizing seed-handling under the more experimentally controlled conditions of head-fixation. We will combine this approach with tools for optogenetic silencing of either selectively targeted cortical areas or selectively labeled corticospinal neurons in motor cortex, as well as multi- probe/multi-channel linear array recordings of spiking activity in key nodes along sensorimotor pathways. Collectively this work will advance our understanding of the elemental movements involved in the dexterous manipulation of food, providing new insights into this process in a genetically tractable model organism, and opening the way for future studies to dissect the cellular mechanisms in sensorimotor circuits mediating specific aspects of forelimb and digit motor control. NARRATIVE The proposed research on dexterous forelimb behavior is directly relevant to public health because pathology in the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors severely impairs motor control. By elucidating fundamental aspects of these behaviors in a model mammalian organism, the mouse, this research can lead to new treatments of disease, and is thus relevant to those aspects of the NIH mission aimed at improving health through understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in disorders causing disability.",Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity,9982480,R21NS116886,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mastication', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'free behavior', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,434500,0.017331922
"G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit Project Summary The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU. In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4 senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular senescence in the brain. Project Narrative Senescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This project investigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway, the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway, in senescence of neurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional changes, and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of the components of the NVU - endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons, and pericytes.",G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit,10044252,RF1AG068292,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Binding Proteins', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'CXC chemokine receptor 3', 'CXCL10 gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromatin', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'G-Quartets', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guanine', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitotic', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Parabiosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pericytes', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tg2576', 'Tight Junctions', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Water', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'chromatin remodeling', 'dentate gyrus', 'effective therapy', 'frontal lobe', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'mouse model', 'negative affect', 'neurovascular unit', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'oxidation', 'prevent', 'quadruplex DNA', 'senescence', 'small molecule']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,RF1,2020,1560000,0.014167119
"A MOUSE MODEL FOR CHRONIC ORAL ALUMINUM TOXICITY Systemic aluminum produces encephalopathy and osteomalacia in humans, but environmental toxicity has been considered minimal because of low oral bioavailability.  However, in pilot work we have demonstrated neurotoxicity in lactating mice fed diets containing 500ppm aluminum, one order of magnitude above human exposure levels.  In addition, developmental toxicity including growth retardation, developmental delay and depressed immune function was seen in offspring.  In the proposed experiments, we have hypothesized that interaction with essential trace element metabolism leads to enhanced susceptibility to oral aluminum toxicity during developmental periods.  The experiments include studies of vulnerable periods, dose-response relationships, maternal-fetal transfer, interaction with trace metal deficient diets and definition of ""no observable adverse effect"" levels.  Swiss-Webster mice will be fed purified diets with precisely controlled levels of essential trace metals and supplemented with aluminum lactate at levels of 100, 500 or 1000 ppm elemental aluminum.  Diets will be fed for a six week period to nonpregnant, pregnant or lactating female mice.  The design includes pair fed controls.  Dams will be evaluated for neurotoxicity (functional signs and neurohistopathology), immunotoxicity and tissue concentrations of essential trace metals (Zn, Cu, Mg, Fe, Ca) and aluminum.  Offspring will also be evaluated for tissue trace metal levels as well as growth, developmental delay and behavioral and immune function.  Behavior and immune function will be evaluated at weaning and again two weeks after termination of aluminum exposure to determine residual effects.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate.

"Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the first regions in the brain to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, and is important for object recognition, odor discrimination and episodic memory. Hence, early AD symptoms such as misplacing objects, forgetting events and loss of smell could be due to LEC dysfunction. In order to understand how Aβ and tau accumulation impacts the LEC neurons, we will use two mouse models of AD: APP knockin (APP-KI) mice- expressing physiological levels of APP and EC- APP/Tau mice- expressing elevated levels of APP and tau in the EC. Both mouse models show selectively vulnerability in the LEC, making them ideal candidates to probe LEC function. Our preliminary data shows behavioral impairment in the EC-APP/Tau mice at 24 months and data on APP-KI show impairment at 18 months. In the proposal we will evaluate LEC function in the younger mice in order to detect neuronal changes prior to behavioral deficits. We will record LEC activity with silicon probes and test responses towards objects, odors and passage of time. Using computational approach such as machine learning, we will determine if ensemble properties of LEC neurons are affected by tau and Aβ. We hypothesize that APP in the LEC of APP-KI mice will make the neurons dysfunctional which will be evident with poor decoding accuracy for objects, odors and temporal epochs. In the EC-APP/Tau mice, combined effect of Aβ and tau will make the dysfunction worse and affect the decoding accuracy further allowing better prediction of early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to record ensemble populations of neurons and develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate function in a vulnerable brain region that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease. Inability to smell odors, misplacing items and confusion with events are some of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and pathology in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the brain could be the major cause for these early symptoms.

"LISPRO, an ionic cocrystal of lithium, as a potential novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, we were the first to report the crystal structure of an ICC of lithium with an organic anion, salicylic acid, and l-proline (LISPRO). We also found that this change in speciation did not negatively affect the bioactivity of lithium at several endpoints with relevance to the treatment of AD. These clinically relevant endpoints included: increasing inhibitory GSK3ß (Ser9) phosphorylation and decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation in human tau transfected HeLa cells as well as modulating/rebalancing GSK3ß (Ser9/Thr390) phosphorylation and reducing ß-amyloid deposits and levels of tau hyperphosphorylation in Tg2576 mice. In addition, LISPRO treatment promoted anti-inflammatory/Th2 responses and decreased proinflammatory soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the CNS of these mice. Importantly the salicylate group may underlie these added effects not seen with LiCO3. Not only did the cocrystal outperform or match the efficacy of the lithium control at all endpoints but it also produced profound modulation of lithium's pharmacokinetics. Previously, no lithium salts were reported with modulated pharmacokinetics. By incorporating the salicylate anion into the crystal structure, we achieved plateau-like plasma and brain lithium levels out to 48 h in rats. Most importantly LISPRO reduced the toxic plasma level spike seen with Li2CO3 which has been associated with adverse effects. LISPRO could completely abolish this spike and we hypothesize that this will significantly enhance its safety. Further, salicylic aid is the primary active metabolite in aspirin and, unlike current FDA- approved lithium salts, this anion is bioactive and may be synergistic for reducing neuroinflammation associated with AD.  In this proposal, we intend to fully characterize LISPRO's therapeutic potential in 3XTg-AD mouse model in the following 3 specific aims: (1) Examine cognitive impairment in 3XTg-AD mice following oral LISPRO treatment - we will examine whether oral administration of LISPRO could improve neurocognition in 3XTg-AD mice using a well established battery of behavioral tests. Further, we will test if this cognitive improvement could be correlated with reductions in AD-like pathology (Aß levels/deposits and NFT formation). (2) Determine AD-like pathological changes in 3XTg-AD mice following oral LISPRO treatment - Following LISPRO treatment, we will sacrifice these mice at several ages to examine AD-like pathological changes, and possible undesirable side-effects including Notch processing and any possible renal impairment. Groups will be compared by their effects on AD-like pathology. (3) Characterize glial activation states ex vivo in young and aged 3XTg-AD mice following oral LISPRO treatment - We will examine LISPRO's ability to promote the M2 phenotype ex vivo in primary microglia isolated from young or aged LISPRO-fed 3XTg-AD mice compared with those fed control diets. These data should be important to begin to understand how LISPRO mechanistically works at the cellular level to reduce AD pathology and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive dementia associated with impairment in memory and behavior. It currently accounts for about 70% of all dementias and onset typically occurs in mid-late life. The frequency doubles every five years after age 60, increasing from a prevalence of about 1% in individuals aged 60 years to about 40% among those aged 85 years or greater. Thus this disease is a clear healthcare problem for all individuals living past the age of 60. In terms of healthcare costs, it's estimated that the toal direct and indirect costs related to AD alone are, on a per-patient basis, some $91,000 over the course the illness. In this proposal, we intend to fully characterize the therapeutic potential of n ICC of lithium with an organic anion, salicylic acid, and l-proline (LISPRO) in 3XTg-AD mouse model. These studies could lay the foundation for AD clinical trials with LISPRO in the near future.","LISPRO, an ionic cocrystal of lithium, as a potential novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease",9692460,R01AG050253,"['3xTg-AD mouse', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anions', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Citrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Crystallization', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diet', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'FDA approved', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hela Cells', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lithium', 'Lithium Carbonate', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Microglia', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Mus', 'Neurocognition', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Oral', 'Oral Administration', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polypharmacy', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Proline', 'Proteolysis', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Salicylic Acids', 'Salts', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Techniques', 'Tg2576', 'Therapeutic', 'Toes', 'Work', 'aged', 'behavior test', 'beta amyloid pathology', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'conditioned fear', 'cytokine', 'gamma secretase', 'glial activation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'long short term memory', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'presenilin', 'prophylactic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'side effect', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2019,373750,-0.037227523
"Uncovering Basic Signaling Mechanisms in NK Cells in Mice and Humans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that defend us by lysing tumor and pathogen-infected cells. Recent experiments showed generation of long-lived ""memory"" NK cells in mouse and humans challenged by viral infections (such as CMV), similar to that of memory lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system. We seek to develop a quantitative mechanistic framework with predictive powers for signaling and activation in NK cells including ""memory"" NK cells in mice and humans by using a synergistic combination of in silico modeling and wet lab experiments. The in silico modeling rooted in statistical physics, non-linear dynamics, and multivariate statistics will be combined with standard biochemical and multi-parametric single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF mass cytometer) experiments on engineered human NK cell lines (NKLs), and naive and ""memory"" NK cells from mice and humans. We will investigate three overlapping aims: Aim 1: Develop a quantitative mechanistic framework for analyzing signaling and activation of NK cells stimulated by activating and inhibitory CMV-encoded ligands. Aim 2: Determine differences in signaling mechanisms between naive and ""memory"" NK cells in the mouse. Aim 3: Determine differences in signaling mechanisms between mouse and human ""memory"" NK cells. At the successful completion of the aims we will have a quantitative predictive mechanistic framework for studying NK cell signaling in mice and humans. The systems level knowledge gained from the proposed projects can also be applied in understanding mechanisms of activation regulated by heterogeneous receptor ligand interactions in other immune cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The developed in silico models with predictive powers will help generate new hypotheses and design experiments for studying NK cell activation.

"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.
