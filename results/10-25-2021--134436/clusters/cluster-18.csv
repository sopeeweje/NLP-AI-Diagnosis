"A Unified Framework for Flexible Brain Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data driven methods are being increasingly used to analyze brain imaging data. FMRI analyses can be put on an analytic spectrum with heavily model-based approaches (like the general linear model (GLM) implemented in the SPM software) on one end and flexible data-driven approaches like independent component analysis (ICA), principal component analysis (PCA), or clustering on the other end. In between there is a gap, which we and others have been trying to fill. In particular, methods such as ICA are particularly useful for reducing the multivariate fMRI problem down to one that is both tractable and also enables the incorporation of prior information. In the first period of this competing renewal, we focused our efforts upon developing ICA of fMRI methods which would be suitable for making group inferences, and which would allow the incorporation of prior information, hence moving from a 'blind' ICA approach to a semi-blind ICA approach. Despite the progress we have made, there is still considerable work to be done in the analysis of fMRI data with ICA. In this competing renewal, we propose to continue and significantly expand this work. First, we will extend our semi-blind ICA (sbICA) framework to provide a general framework for incorporating prior information from multiple spatial and temporal sources. In the second aim we will focus upon statistical inference and develop a framework for integrating the relevant functional components. In the third aim, we will validate the algorithms in aims 1 and 2, including using fMRI data collected on multiple days from a variety of paradigms. In this aim we develop a decision mechanism for selecting the best combination of methods given a particular problem. For the fourth aim, we will apply our methods to data collected during four well-studied paradigms in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Our final aim involves the continuing development of our GIFT toolbox, and incorporation of the above algorithms, constraint selection mechanisms, and visual interfaces into the software. The successful completion of this research will provide a powerful set of tools for the research community to increase the sensitivity and specificity of BOLD analysis methods by drawing upon the strengths of both model-based and data-driven approaches. These tools will also provide a way to study the inter-relationship among functional networks in a flexible manner. This has application not only in schizophrenia but in many other diseases such as Alzheimer's, attention deficit hyperactivity, and psychopathy.          n/a",A Unified Framework for Flexible Brain Image Analysis,8022867,R01EB000840,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'blind', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'operation', 'psychopathic personality', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2011,466895,0.09322361620878207

"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9562203,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,162344,0.07923171734798816

"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.02820133480437606
"Integrating literature and experimental data for druggability methods ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder that affects one percent of the general population and leads to an increased risk of homelessness and suicide. Because the genetic component underlying schizophrenia is not well understood, a patient's symptoms are usually the focus of treatment. With limited drug classes for treatment, schizophrenia is a prime candidate for drug repurposing. Over the last decade, drug development has remained stagnant even with the reference genome and an abundance of experimental data. Due to the high development cost and likelihood of failing during clinical trials, drug discovery has focused on an estimated 3000 druggable human genes; however, this narrow focus has severely limited the potential for discovery. With an estimated 3000 druggable human genes, great potential remains for discovery of new drugs and novel uses for current drugs from a variety of sources, including literature and gene expression data. Literature is the most comprehensive resource for known information and, more specifically, high quality low- throughput data. Due to the availability of high-throughput experimental data, many computational methods for drug discovery and repurposing have focused on incorporating this data into their algorithms; however, data extracted from the literature is equally valuable. To investigate druggability using literature and experimental data, I propose the following specific aims: (1) integrate drug, gene, and disease relationships from the literature and experimental data sources; (2) infer druggable proteins using networks of protein, drug, and disease interactions with experimental data; and (3) apply the network model to schizophrenia to predict novel druggable proteins for drug repurposing. With success, I will create a novel methodology to integrate literature and high-throughput experimental data and apply this methodology to discover novel druggable proteins related to schizophrenia that can inform future drug repurposing studies.         Project Narrative Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects one percent of the general population and leads to increase risk of homelessness and suicide. Discovery of novel druggable proteins will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug-gene interactions that treat a disease. This work has the potential to inform future drug development to improve treatment of schizophrenia and many other diseases.",Integrating literature and experimental data for druggability methods,9123329,F31LM012354,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biotechnology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Homelessness', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene interaction', 'improved', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'severe mental illness', 'success', 'text searching']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,40790,0.13349899851132527
"LINKAGE ANALYSIS METHODS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA The long-term goal is to provide new and improved analytical methods that will enable researchers to find gene markers genetically linked with the putative gene(s) for schizophrenia.

"Brain Activity and Language Comprehension in Psychosis   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Thought disorder is a cardinal symptom of       schizophrenia, and is inferred through abnormal language. The underlying             cognitive abnormality that causes thought disorder is unknown. The broad aim of      this proposal is to understand the neurophysiological basis of thought disorder      in schizophrenia and psychotic mania. We will test a model of semantic               over-activation and verbal Working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia,              contrasted with an executive attention abnormality in mania. We will measure         language comprehension, reaction times, and the activity of the brain via            event-related potentials, and correlate these measures with clinical measures        of symptoms and neuropsychological measures of working memory performance. One       possible dysfunction is an abnormality in semantic memory activation                 (hyperpriming) whereby associated by contextually inappropriate concepts crowd       the mind of schizophrenia patients. Paradoxically, schizophrenia patients            outperform controls on speeded lexical decision tasks, with faster reaction          times. However, at slower speeds, the performance of patients falls off              sharply. The neural substrates of this hyperpriming and of the later drop off        in performance are unknown. We test a two-factor model of schizophrenic thought      disorder with both an initial automatic excitatory abnormality and a later           abnormality in the controlled utilization of context stored in verbal working        memory by having subjects process sentences, word pairs, and word triplets for       semantic relatedness. The stimuli will include homographs as the primary probe       of associative derangement.                                                                                                                                               Homographs are words with multiple meanings, and occupy places in more than one      unrelated semantic network. For example, board may mean plank or committee.          Schizophrenia patients appear to display a semantic bias towards strong              associates and networks such that they tend to select the dominant homograph         meaning (board means plank) even in the face of context that mandates accessing      the subordinate meaning (board means committee). We propose to examine language      processing while varying networks strength (dominant versus subordinate              meanings), while varying associative strength (strongly versus weakly                associated words), in the face of strongly biasing context followed by weak          associates, and in the face of weakly biasing context followed by strong             associates. These different manipulations will be presented under fast (250          msec) and slow (1.25 sec) rates, to more heavily stress the semantic activation      system and the verbal working memory system respectively.

One       possible dysfunction is an abnormality in semantic memory activation                 (hyperpriming) whereby associated by contextually inappropriate concepts crowd       the mind of schizophrenia patients. Paradoxically, schizophrenia patients            outperform controls on speeded lexical decision tasks, with faster reaction          times. However, at slower speeds, the performance of patients falls off              sharply. The neural substrates of this hyperpriming and of the later drop off        in performance are unknown. We test a two-factor model of schizophrenic thought      disorder with both an initial automatic excitatory abnormality and a later           abnormality in the controlled utilization of context stored in verbal working        memory by having subjects process sentences, word pairs, and word triplets for       semantic relatedness. The stimuli will include homographs as the primary probe       of associative derangement.                                                                                                                                               Homographs are words with multiple meanings, and occupy places in more than one      unrelated semantic network. For example, board may mean plank or committee.          Schizophrenia patients appear to display a semantic bias towards strong              associates and networks such that they tend to select the dominant homograph         meaning (board means plank) even in the face of context that mandates accessing      the subordinate meaning (board means committee). We propose to examine language      processing while varying networks strength (dominant versus subordinate              meanings), while varying associative strength (strongly versus weakly                associated words), in the face of strongly biasing context followed by weak          associates, and in the face of weakly biasing context followed by strong             associates. These different manipulations will be presented under fast (250          msec) and slow (1.25 sec) rates, to more heavily stress the semantic activation      system and the verbal working memory system respectively.                                                                                                                 The use of ERPs allows for direct measures of stimulus processing, and provides      some information about putative sources of brain dysfunction (when informed          from previous direct recordings). These studies have the potential to help           clarify the nature of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and in psychotic        mania.                                                                               n/a",Brain Activity and Language Comprehension in Psychosis,6399029,R01MH058704,"['attention', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' bipolar depression manic phase', ' brain electrical activity', ' comprehension', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' evoked potentials', ' human subject', ' language', ' memory', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuropathology', ' neuropsychological tests', ' neuropsychology', ' patient oriented research', ' psychological models', ' psychometrics', ' schizophrenia']",NIMH,"MC LEAN HOSPITAL (BELMONT, MA)",R01,2001,186205,0.08864917140161842
"Neural Network Models of Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is characterized by alterations of language and inferential processes. In spite of extensive research, core mechanisms of these disturbances remain uncertain. The overall objective of this RO1 proposal is to use DISCERN, a neural network simulation of natural language processing (Miikkulainen & Dyer 1991; Miikkulainen 1993, 1998), to investigate the mechanism(s) of language-based disturbances in schizophrenia. DISCERN learns stories, utilizes inferential processes, replies to questions, and produces coherent, multi-sentence narrative paraphrases of episodic memories. To enhance applicability of DISCERN as a model of human narrative language production, a larger corpus of stories will be learned that incorporates emotion-coding and self-reference. Simulations will be conducted to determine if disrupted function in different neural modules of DISCERN can produce three core language-based illness manifestations of schizophrenia -- (I) positive thought disorder (such as derailment and illogicality), (II) negative thought disorder (reduced language outputs), and (III) delusions of the idee fixe type. DISCERN will be used to compare and contrast effects of excessive noise versus reduced network connectivity when applied to semantic and working memory modules. Both types of ""lesions"" have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Noise-induced lesions are predicted to produce word selection errors and curtail language output -- but not to produce positive thought disorder or delusions. In contrast, connectivity loss, when applied to story processing modules, is predicted to simulate all three disturbances, i.e., derailment and curtailment of language outputs as well as production of ""fixed"" narratives that simulate delusions. A parallel, pilot study of normal subjects and patients with schizophrenia will assess narrative recall of episodic memory.

"Classifying Schizophrenia:Leukocyte Multigene Signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is designed to produce data for development of a biological classification of schizophrenic patients, based on high-density microarray measurement of transcribed white blood cell (leukocyte) RNA. In a recently completed NIMH B-start grant, the PI has utilized global gene expression analysis of peripheral leukocytes as a classification medium for schizophrenia. The preliminary study results were striking; hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from seven schizophrenic patients and five controls, resulted in classification of all the samples into their correct group (schizophrenic patients or healthy controls). This exciting result has led to the present proposal with the following Specific Aims: (1) a. To collect peripheral blood leukocytes from twenty neuroleptic-naive schizophrenics, twelve neuroleptic-treated schizophrenics, and fourteen healthy control subjects over the two-year period of the project, and b. To employ Affymetrix GeneChip mieroarray technology to measure global gene expression in the leukocyte samples. (2) The leukocyte gene expression datasets collected during the preliminary study and the proposal, resulting in a final analysis of 58 subjects, will be combined and analyzed by hierarchical clustering and discriminate analyses to identify and validate multi-gene fingerprints that differentiate schizophrenic subjects from healthy controls. The current proposed study, which incorporates the collection of samples from neurolepfic-naive schizophrenic patients, is designed to avoid the potential confounding factor of neuroleptic-medication induced gene expression changes. We are optimistic that completion of this proposed exploratory study will lead to the creation of a multigene expression signature that can classify leukocyte samples into schizophrenic patient or control groups and that can be used to predict the class of unknown samples. If the validity of our approach is demonstrated in this exploratory study, our longer-term aims for this research are to increase the scope of this work by: 1. Increasing the number of subjects in our schizophrenic dataset to the level of acceptable statistical power and also duplicating this dataset for other psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder and major depression. This will allow us to test these classification signatures and thus attempt biological diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and possible biological subtypes of those disorders. These biological signatures may, in turn, stimulate the development of targeted novel medications.  2. Perform a follow-up study recruiting families with members at increased risk of developing schizophrenia. These families will allow us to test whether gene expression patterns that classify schizophrenia are present in premorbid subjects and whether it is possible to predict risk of illness, and thus provide early treatment that might mitigate the course of the disorder. The public health benefits of a biological classification of schizophrenia are potentially large, especially if predictive testing in the premorbid stage is possible, raising the possibility of targeted preventative treatment.         n/a",Classifying Schizophrenia:Leukocyte Multigene Signatures,6750683,R21MH066883,"['antipsychotic agents', 'bipolar depression', 'clinical research', 'complementary DNA', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'leukocytes', 'major depression', 'messenger RNA', 'microarray technology', 'mood disorders', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'schizophrenia']",NIMH,NATHAN S.

"Auditory-verbal functional studies of schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess early auditory processing, verbal semantic processing, and their association with positive symptoms in first episode (FE), chronic schizophrenic (CSZ), and matched control subjects (CN). These studies are aimed at understanding the link between brain dysfunction and symptoms, thus facilitating the discovery of preventative measures and treatments. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) plays a major role in auditory speech perception and language processing. This region is consistently reported to show volume reductions in MRI studies of schizophrenic subjects (SZ). These volume reductions have been linked to auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, and auditory event-related potential (ERP) abnormalities. Left STG abnormalities are also consistently shown in functional imaging studies of active hallucination or of auditory-verbal processing in SZ. Abnormal fMRI activity in the STG in chronic SZ was found using mismatch negativity (MMN) stimuli that were similar to those used in an ERP paradigm. Recent discoveries have documented structural and functional evidence for the basis of language lateralization in normal individuals. We will use these recent discoveries, in a rapid acoustic processing task (RAP), in addition to the MMN task, as a basis for proposed studies examining early auditory processing in SZ. Lateral temporal (middle, inferior) and temporal-parietal regions are thought to play a role in semantic processing. These regions have also shown abnormalities in functional imaging and ERP studies of schizophrenia that use language. Semantic priming has been shown (although not consistently) in a number of studies to be abnormal in SZ. A recent behavioral study used words that differed in terms of the properties of their semantic networks. The reduced performance of SZ subjects on the cued recall of words was attributed to the effects of abnormal connectivity in the semantic network but not network size. SZ and CN subjects will be tested in an fMRI study of auditory/verbal semantic priming. This study will examine the brain activity related to the spreading activation between semantic associates. Words will vary in the degree of connectivity, and hence the degree of spreading activation between their associates.

This region is consistently reported to show volume reductions in MRI studies of schizophrenic subjects (SZ). These volume reductions have been linked to auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, and auditory event-related potential (ERP) abnormalities. Left STG abnormalities are also consistently shown in functional imaging studies of active hallucination or of auditory-verbal processing in SZ. Abnormal fMRI activity in the STG in chronic SZ was found using mismatch negativity (MMN) stimuli that were similar to those used in an ERP paradigm. Recent discoveries have documented structural and functional evidence for the basis of language lateralization in normal individuals. We will use these recent discoveries, in a rapid acoustic processing task (RAP), in addition to the MMN task, as a basis for proposed studies examining early auditory processing in SZ. Lateral temporal (middle, inferior) and temporal-parietal regions are thought to play a role in semantic processing. These regions have also shown abnormalities in functional imaging and ERP studies of schizophrenia that use language. Semantic priming has been shown (although not consistently) in a number of studies to be abnormal in SZ. A recent behavioral study used words that differed in terms of the properties of their semantic networks. The reduced performance of SZ subjects on the cued recall of words was attributed to the effects of abnormal connectivity in the semantic network but not network size. SZ and CN subjects will be tested in an fMRI study of auditory/verbal semantic priming. This study will examine the brain activity related to the spreading activation between semantic associates. Words will vary in the degree of connectivity, and hence the degree of spreading activation between their associates. A recently completed preliminary study of CN subjects used this semantic priming task (SP) and found that as predicted, different patterns of brain activity in temporal lobe regions were associated with different semantic properties (connectivity and relatedness) of the word pairs.         n/a",Auditory-verbal functional studies of schizophrenia,6863578,R01MH067080,"['auditory discrimination', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'clinical research', 'evoked potentials', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'hallucinations', 'human subject', 'language', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychological tests', 'patient oriented research', 'schizophrenia', 'semantics', 'speech recognition']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),R01,2005,287640,0.10760764396604866
"Psychiatric Illness: Multigene Expression Classification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is designed to produce data for the development of a biological classification of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, based on high density microarray measurements of transcribed white blood cell (leukocyte) mRNA. The rationale behind this proposal is based on two sources of data; 1) reports in the literature that document differential expression of immune system response mediators among patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and 2) preliminary results obtained as part of a recently completed NIMH B-start grant. In the preliminary experiments, the PI utilized global gene expression analysis of peripheral leukocytes as a classification medium for schizophrenia. The study results were striking; unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from eight schizophrenic patients and five control subjects, resulted in classification of all the samples into their correct group (schizophrenic patients or healthy controls). In addition, and of significance to this current proposal, hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from the schizophrenic patients and from two bipolar disorder patients, resulted in the bipolar disorder patients grouping into a single, discrete subnode from the schizophrenics.  Based on this exciting result, the present proposal has been developed with the following specific aims: la) To collect peripheral blood leukocytes from 25 men with bipolar disorder and 25 men with schizophrenia, over the two year period of this project, lb) To measure global gene expression in the leukocyte samples, using Affymetrix GeneChip microarray technology, and 2) To employ the leukocyte gene expression dataset obtained under Specific Aim 1 of the proposal, in hierarchical clustering and supervised learning algorithms to identify and validate multi-gene expression signatures that distinguish between the subjects by diagnostic group. The current proposed study, which involves the collection of leukocyte samples from patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, has been designed to extend our positive findings from the preliminary investigation of schizophrenics. We are optimistic that the completion of this proposed exploratory study will lead to the creation of multigene expression signatures that can classify leukocyte samples into bipolar disorder or schizophrenic patient groups, and which can be employed to predict the classes of unknown samples. If the validity of our approach is demonstrated in this exploratory R21 study, our longer-term aims for this research are to increase the scope of this work by: 1) increasing the number of subjects in our datasets to the level of acceptable statistical power, 2) investigating the feasibility of a biological signature for diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and to extend this investigation to include other psychiatric disorders such as major depression, and 3) investigating correlations between patient responses to treatment regimes and biological expression signatures. These biological signatures may, in turn, stimulate the development of targeted novel medications. Finally, it may be possible to perform additional follow-up studies, recruiting families with members at increased risk of developing bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, which would allow us to test whether gene expression patterns that classify the disorders are present in premorbid subjects and whether it is possible to predict risk of illness. The public health benefits of a biological classification of psychiatric disorders are potentially large, especially if predictive testing in the premorbid stage is possible, raising the possibility of targeted preventative interventions. n/a",Psychiatric Illness: Multigene Expression Classification,6838721,R21MH067941,"['bipolar depression', 'blood cell count', 'blood chemistry', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder classification', 'drug detection', 'gene expression', 'human genetic material tag', 'human subject', 'leukocytes', 'male', 'messenger RNA', 'microarray technology', 'schizophrenia', 'thyroid function']",NIMH,NATHAN S.

This additional expertise will enable me to identify complex relationships between datasets, interpret the obtained microarray data in the light of existing linkage studies, perform limited genotyping experiments on our postmortem samples and verify the uncovered gene expression changes using non-biased, stereological sampling methods.

Furthermore, the presentation of schizophrenia across genders has been associated with differences in age of onset, symptomathology, premorbid history, neuroimaging findings, drug responsiveness and brain structure.   This application is focused around two critical questions: 1) Is there a schizophrenia-related expression profile within and across different brain regions and 2) Are schizophrenia-related expression changes different across genders? In this context, we propose to test seven specific hypotheses using 3 specific aims: Aim1 Compare gene expression pattern in 12 MALE subjects with schizophrenia and matched controls across the prefrontal (PFC) and superior temporal (STG) cortices. Aim 2. Compare gene expression pattern in 12 FEMALE subjects with schizophrenia and matched controls across the prefrontal (PFC) and superior temporal (STG) cortices.

"Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal has been developed in response to PAR-02-062 (Building Translational Research in Behavioral Science). The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that an explicitly translational, multidisciplinary approach to defining the role of dopamine (DA) in schizophrenia (SC), is capable of illuminating some of the most poorly understood, most treatment-resistant cognitive and motivational aspects of the illness. Specifically, recent basic research has shown that DA cell firing plays a critical role in the encoding of reward prediction and reward based learning. The proposed work will provide a rigorous test of the applicability of this hypothesis as a framework for understanding the motivational and learning impairments of SC with important implications for schizophrenia therapeutics. To test this hypothesis, we have organized a group of basic and clinical investigators into three scientific modules:1) electrophysiology, 2) neuroimaging, and 3) behavior, with the overall program designed to address different aspects of same theory of DA function. These modules are designed to develop collaborative partnerships with the results of initial pilot experiments used to refine hypothesis for further experimental testing. Initial studies are proposed to document the specific behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI Bold signal abnormalities of SC patients during the performance of reward learning paradigms, the impact of different antipsychotics on reward processing in animals, and the physiological sequela associated with reward-driven changes in DA cell firing. Computational modeling will be used to determine whether the experimental results in animals and observed deficits in patients are consistent with the hypothesized role of DA in reward processing. The overall program is designed to develop resources, paradigms, and proof of principle studies that illuminate the nature of DA dysfunction in SC through the application of translational paradigms and models demonstrating the critical role of DA in reward and reinforcement learning. If successful, the proposed work is designed to establish the conceptual foundation and preliminary data needed to support individual RO1 applications and a Translational Center.         n/a",Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia,7278791,R24MH072647,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Habenula', 'Haloperidol', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'heuristics', 'human study', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'olanzapine', 'programs', 'quetiapine', 'research study', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'theories', 'translational approach', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2007,342842,0.14425126859398943
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7325760,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2008,65055,0.2664664119562453

"4/5-Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability & Clinical Applications Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive revision in response to NOT-OD-09-058, the ARRA call for Competitive Supplement Applications. In the past decade there has been a growing awareness of the disabling effects of impaired cognition in individuals with schizophrenia and the importance of developing new treatments that target cognitive deficits. During this same period, the cognitive neuroscience field has seen an explosion of new knowledge regarding the neural basis of cognition. The application of this new knowledge to drug development in schizophrenia has lagged significantly behind overall progress in cognitive neuroscience, in large part due to the lack of data on the measurement properties of tasks used in cognitive neuroscience. This concern led to the Cognitive Neuroscience Research To Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative, which conducted a series of conferences designed to develop consensus on the constructs and paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that are ripe for translation for use in clinical trials contexts. We were recently funded to start this translation process (Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability & Clinical Applications (CNTRACs) Consortium."") for behavioral paradigms. We brought together a collaborative team that represents significant expertise from the many fields necessary for the success of this endeavor. We are focusing on four constructs that span both early (gain control and visual integration in perception) and higher-level (goal maintenance, relational encoding and retrieval) components of human cognitive processing. Is this competitive revision we will extend this work in a highly critical and significant direction that the field has identified as a growing need - the development of well validated, and reliable functional neuroimaging paradigms that can serve as biomarkers for predicting and assessing drug and intervention response to treatments designed to enhance cognition. This focus meets one of the key topic areas for Competitive Supplements identified by the NIMH, namely Biomaterials and Biological Measures for the Study of Mental Disorders, which includes ""Systematically collecting and analyzing biological measures (e.g., genetic polymorphisms, brain imaging indexes), which could be used, also in combination with clinically derived variables, to identify predictors of outcome, moderators of treatment response and adverse effects, or mediators and patterns of treatment effects."" The end goal for these expanded aims will be to provide the field with: 1) easy to use imaging paradigms of these three cognitive functions that: 2) have been optimized for use in a clinical trials context (efficient, reliable, robust); while 3) maintaining their validity as specific measures of the cognitive and neural processes of interest. We believe that it is feasible to complete this added Aim in the time frame of the ARRA announcement, given that we have an established infrastructure. This set of collaborative R01 proposals meet the goals of the ARRA stimulus by providing for funding for 9 new positions, 3 positions that would allow us to retain staff that would otherwise need to be let go, and 1 position that we can increase from part to full time.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has high relevance for public health by significantly improving our ability to translate paradigms developed into the basic cognitive neuroscience literature for use in clinical trials aimed at improving cognition in schizophrenia. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are a major predictor of functional outcome in this debilitating illness. Thus, we need to improve our methods for detecting and enhancing cognitive function in schizophrenia in order to help individuals with this illness lead more productive and fulfilling lives.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project has high relevance for public health by significantly improving our ability to translate paradigms developed into the basic cognitive neuroscience literature for use in clinical trials aimed at improving cognition in schizophrenia.

"2/5-Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability & Clinical Applications Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive revision in response to NOT-OD-09-058, the ARRA call for Competitive Supplement Applications. In the past decade there has been a growing awareness of the disabling effects of impaired cognition in individuals with schizophrenia and the importance of developing new treatments that target cognitive deficits. During this same period, the cognitive neuroscience field has seen an explosion of new knowledge regarding the neural basis of cognition. The application of this new knowledge to drug development in schizophrenia has lagged significantly behind overall progress in cognitive neuroscience, in large part due to the lack of data on the measurement properties of tasks used in cognitive neuroscience. This concern led to the Cognitive Neuroscience Research To Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative, which conducted a series of conferences designed to develop consensus on the constructs and paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that are ripe for translation for use in clinical trials contexts. We were recently funded to start this translation process (Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability & Clinical Applications (CNTRACs) Consortium."") for behavioral paradigms. We brought together a collaborative team that represents significant expertise from the many fields necessary for the success of this endeavor. We are focusing on four constructs that span both early (gain control and visual integration in perception) and higher-level (goal maintenance, relational encoding and retrieval) components of human cognitive processing.

"Genetic contributions to deficits in adaptive function in schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goals of schizophrenia research are to achieve understanding of the relationships between its genetic and environmental risk factors, biological and mental abnormalities, and pharmacological and psychosocial interventions effective in prevention/treatment of associated pathology. My career goal is to establish an effective, inter-disciplinary research program that will improve our understanding of schizophrenia throughout its multiple levels of pathology. The present project will be an important step toward this goal because it will take an inter-disciplinary approach to examine molecular genetic and neurocognitive bases of a core feature of schizophrenia - deficits in adaptive function. My doctoral training as a cognitive neuroscientist, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship in psychiatric neuroimaging and electrophysiology, have provided me with the necessary expertise to study neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. I now wish to integrate my training in neuropsychiatry with training in genetics that will enable me to investigate the association between specific genes and neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. Mass. General Hospital provides an ideal environment for this training as it unites a number of outstanding laboratories working in neuroscience, psychiatry, and genetics. Despite recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of the DLPFC, the neurocognitive mechanisms by which this system contributes to maladaptive behavior in schizophrenia are not yet well understood. Our preliminary data suggest that DLPFC mechanisms mediating specific real-world knowledge critical for flexible behavior are impaired in schizophrenia. The overall goal of this project is to examine contributions of COMT and MTHFR genes, known to influence prefrontal function, to these abnormalities. We will assay target neurocognitive mechanisms by recording high spatial resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and cost-effective electrophysiological (ERR) data while schizophrenia patients and healthy controls participate in a novel, ecologically valid paradigm that presents real-world goal- directed behaviors, conveyed in video clips.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may clarify the neurocognitive interpretation of the contributions of two candidate genes to the symptoms of schizophrenia. The results may direct future research of real-world knowledge acquisition in children at genetic risk for schizophrenia, with an ultimate goal to design early intervention treatments. They may help to develop a new endophenotype of schizophrenia to assist search for susceptibility genes of this disorder.

Despite recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of the DLPFC, the neurocognitive mechanisms by which this system contributes to maladaptive behavior in schizophrenia are not yet well understood. Our preliminary data suggest that DLPFC mechanisms mediating specific real-world knowledge critical for flexible behavior are impaired in schizophrenia. The overall goal of this project is to examine contributions of COMT and MTHFR genes, known to influence prefrontal function, to these abnormalities. We will assay target neurocognitive mechanisms by recording high spatial resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and cost-effective electrophysiological (ERR) data while schizophrenia patients and healthy controls participate in a novel, ecologically valid paradigm that presents real-world goal- directed behaviors, conveyed in video clips.

"Olfaction in the Psychosis Prodrome: Behavioral and ERP Measures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Olfactory function is disturbed in schizophrenia, as identified by behavioral markers (smell identification and odor threshold) and olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs). These disturbances are also present in unaffected family members, which make them good candidates as potential biomarkers of schizophrenia risk. Smell identification deficits were found to discriminate who among high-risk cases will actually develop schizophrenia. Little is, however, known about the underlying pathophysiology of emerging psychosis during the prodromal period. This R21 application brings together clinical researchers doing prodromal studies and investigators with expertise in cognitive and electrophysiologic studies in schizophrenia. The proposed study will use improved methods for ERP analyses and for identifying at-risk young people so as to evaluate in cross-section behavioral and electrophysiological measures of olfactory function in prodromal patients, and their association with symptom features and measures of social and cognition function. If olfactory ERPs are found to be abnormal in prodromal patients, we will then apply for an R01 to evaluate whether olfactory ERPs in a prodromal cohort may be a biomarker of conversion to schizophrenia. ERPs and behavioral detection responses will be measured in 30 prodromal patients and 30 matched healthy controls to three concentrations of hydrogen sulfide during a detection task. This will take advantage of existing methods for precise control of olfactory stimuli (olfactometer) and also new data analytic techniques in the electrophysiologic domain. Current source density (CSD; surface Laplacian) and temporal principal components analysis (PCA) are combined to yield reference-free measures of radial current flow corresponding to meaningful olfactory ERP components. Auditory ERPs will also be measured during a novelty oddball detection task so as to begin to examine the modality specificity of olfactory ERP deficits. Interviewer-based and self-ratings of psychopathology, measures of social function, facial emotion recognition, and cognitive function will be used to examine the relation of ERP and behavioral olfactory deficits in patients to prodromal symptoms, social function, and cognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: From a clinical perspective, the study of prodromal patients is of importance not only for discovering markers for predicting conversion to schizophrenia but also for the potential development of treatments that would precede the onset of psychosis.

"Whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Genetic factors have been strongly implicated. The genetic contribution to schizophrenia is, however, likely to be complex and difficult to capture by merely considering sequence variation. DNA methylation studies represent a particularly promising complement for several reasons. First, as methylation is directly related to gene expression, knowledge of gene methylation levels may add to the prediction of disease status. Second, methylation studies can provide insight into phenomena such as age of onset, the episodic nature of schizophrenia, gene-environment interactions, parental effects, and sex differences. Third, methylation sites are also excellent new drug targets as they are modifiable by pharmacological interventions. Finally, methylation markers are accessible at the stable DNA level, which from a translational perspective means that they can potentially also be used in clinical settings to improve diagnosis and treatment.  Methylation studies have historically been restricted to a limited number of candidate genes. However, it has recently become technically and economically feasible to measure the methylation status of millions of markers simultaneously. This resembles recent developments in genomewide association studies (GWAS), which have accelerated the discovery of disease variants considerably. To identify methylation sites related to schizophrenia, we have applied statistical theory developed by our group to determine the most cost-effective study design. Based on these optimal design calculations, we propose a whole genome methylation profiling study in 750 schizophrenia cases and 750 controls. To eliminate false discoveries due to technical and sampling errors, we will follow up the most promising sites in an independent sample of schizophrenia cases and controls using pyrosequencing. Our current power calculations suggest that we may need to follow up 65 regions in 800 cases and 800 controls. However, one strength of the statistical method we developed is that it can be used adaptively--that is, the optimal sample size and number of markers for the second pyrosequencing replication stage can be empirically determined based on parameters estimated from the first, array-based discovery stage. In order to improve our understanding of the disease mechanisms, secondary analyses will be performed relating the methylation regions to clinical information as well as to a genome-wide panel of already available SNP markers and copy number variant calls.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness.

"PCr-based fMRSI Biomarker for Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular evidence that schizophrenia is a disorder of synaptic elimination was provided by in vivo 31P MRS studies of never-medicated, first-episode schizophrenia subjects. Recent genetic studies also support the role of synaptic elimination in schizophrenia. A recent in vivo 31P-1H MRS study of normal childhood and adolescent subjects (N = 105, 6-18 years) showed that phosphocreatine (PCr) is the most sensitive molecular biomarker for regionally specific synaptic elimination. The aim of this proposal is to develop in Year 1 quantitative functional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (fMRSI) at 3.0 Tesla (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with application to schizophrenia subjects in Year 2. Noninvasive in vivo, functional PCr-based 31P fMRSI (PCr-fMRSI) will use published fMRS activation paradigms with appropriate modification for PCr-fMRSI. PCr-fMRSI should be more closely linked to synaptic activity than fMRI. To examine neuromolecular underpinnings of schizophrenia we propose to setup and optimize visual stimulation and MR parameters in humans for a PCr-fMRSI visual stimulation paradigm (i.e., with and without primary visual cortical stimulation in the form of radial red/black checkerboard flickering at 8 Hz) which has been shown to stimulate the human primary visual cortex. Also, we propose to evaluate, clinically and neuropsychologically, a small cohort of chronic schizophrenia subjects (n = 16, ages 18 to 55 yrs; 8 cognitively intact, 4 males, 4 females; 8 cognitively impaired, 4 males, 4 females) whose cognitive function range from normal to severe, generalized cognitive impairment and control subjects matched for age, gender, length of illness, and parental education (Nn = 28, ages 18 to 55 yrs, 10 males, 6 females). We propose to perform PCr-fMRSI (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with primary visual cortical stimulation and MRI on these chronic schizophrenia and normal control cohorts to include the following regions of interest, left and right: dorsal prefrontal cortex; superior temporal cortex; inferior parietal cortex; and occipital cortex. Structural volumetric MRI will be performed enabling the volume of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid to be determined on the same voxels that the functional PCr- fMRSI measurements are obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging anisotropy measurements will be performed to study white matter deficits in schizophrenia and their relationship to regions that show fPCr-MRSI activation. This study will develop PCr-fMRSI to study synaptic membrane depolarization-repolarization which will be applied to chronic schizophrenia to test the hypothesis of exaggerated synaptic elimination in dorsal prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects compared with healthy controls.        Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome. This application is to develop a molecular biomarker of schizophrenia based on PCr-based functional 31P MRS to detect differences in synaptic elimination in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. This could be extremely useful in predicting functional outcome and monitoring response to therapeutic measures.

Diffusion tensor imaging anisotropy measurements will be performed to study white matter deficits in schizophrenia and their relationship to regions that show fPCr-MRSI activation. This study will develop PCr-fMRSI to study synaptic membrane depolarization-repolarization which will be applied to chronic schizophrenia to test the hypothesis of exaggerated synaptic elimination in dorsal prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects compared with healthy controls.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome. This application is to develop a molecular biomarker of schizophrenia based on PCr-based functional 31P MRS to detect differences in synaptic elimination in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. This could be extremely useful in predicting functional outcome and monitoring response to therapeutic measures.              Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments.

"Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder with specific effects on the uniquely human capacity of language. Indeed, the gross and subtle language abnormalities of schizophrenia can be seen as fundamental illness components, perhaps even as part of a ""biosignature."" Bringing modern linguistics knowledge and tools to this disorder is a promising approach. We have formed a unique, inter-disciplinary collaboration (Dr. Compton, a schizophrenia researcher; Dr. Covington, a computational linguist; Dr. Lunden, a linguist specializing in phonetics; Dr. Cleary, a statistician; and Dr. Blanchard, an expert in measuring negative symptoms) to study some of the most perplexing and disabling facets of schizophrenia, the language/speech abnormalities linked closely to disorganization and negative symptoms. We will analyze speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Rather than examining a single linguistic parameter, we will assess speech in ""syntactic,"" ""semantic,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""phonetic"" domains of linguistics. We will introduce cutting- edge innovation to this area of study by assessing these indices using psycholinguistics software developed by Dr. Covington's group so that our ratings of speech abnormalities will be highly objective and ultra-reliable.  Our long-term goal is to develop multivariable models, and new methods for clinical and research settings, based on computational linguistic indices with inherent reliability from automation and proven validity. In this exploratory/developmental study, we will collect detailed symptom ratings from 100 schizophrenia patients, as well as audio-recorded speech samples and neurocognition scores from these patients and 100 controls. This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8792658,R21MH097999,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Oral cavity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sound Spectrography', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'neglect', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'routine practice', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2014,192679,0.029464699877689023

This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.            ",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8512143,R21MH097999,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Oral cavity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sound Spectrography', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'neglect', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'routine practice', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,249349,0.029464699877689023
"The mutual influence of attention and learning during knowledge acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective learning involves extracting key patterns of information that capture the essence of our experiences and using this information to build useful knowledge that enables predictive behavior in novel situations. Humans have multiple learning systems associated with different brain regions, yet how these learning systems interact is not well understood. Also, existing theories largely ignore how information sampling behaviors are guided by experience and goals during learning. The research presented in this proposal will use a novel theoretical perspective in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking to investigate the mechanisms of attention and learning and their interactions during category learning. The key hypothesis is that during learning, individuals must choose what information to sample, which will be guided by the person's knowledge and current goals. A class of computational models will be developed that recasts category learning as a dynamic decision process in which attention emerges as information processing guided by the learner's goals, capacity limitations, and current knowledge. These models plan a course of action (e.g., eye movements) by looking ahead and evaluating future actions for expected profit. Experiment 1 will test the key prediction of these models that sequential sampling behavior during category learning is mediated by the interaction of attention and knowledge components. Fitting these models to eye movement and classification behavior from perfect and imperfect learners will characterize the nature of information sampling and learning processes that promote optimal category learning. In Experiments 2 and 3, model components will be linked to the specific neurobiological learning systems implicated in category learning. Experiment 2 will develop and validate a novel method of linking formal models to the learning brain by using multivariate brain patterns of fMRI data to adjudicate among competing cognitive models. The key reasoning of this method is that if a model represents the true nature of category learning, continuous measures of that model's states during learning should be reflected in trial-by-trial measures of the learning brain. Experiment 3 will employ this novel model selection method to characterize how interactions between prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and the medial temporal lobe support successful category learning. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support attention and knowledge will provide a means of predicting and promoting effective learning. Moreover, this work has the potential to inform the development of diagnostic tools that precisely characterize cognitive impairments in clinical populations that exhibit learning deficits, such as individuals with schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

"A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are difficult to differentially diagnose and treat, typically leaving their victims with lifetime disability. It is increasingly becoming recognized that traditionally distinct disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychotic features share overlapping symptoms. For example, in addition to positive symptoms, PSD patients also experience deficits in cognitive control/executive functioning, which likely result from dysregulation of the mesocortical and mesostriatal pathways. Importantly, cognitive deficits contribute to deficits in interpersonal and occupational functioning, more traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking) and are currently refractory to treatment. The current application will use novel recruiting strategies and novel multivariate analytic techniques to establish empirical, neuronally-based cluster metrics (i.e., circuit-level pathologies) that are associated with impairments in cognitive control (primary outcome) and everyday functioning (secondary outcome) in PSD regardless of traditional diagnoses (DSM-V). Other potential mediating variables evaluated in the current model include negative symptoms and disorganized thinking. We investigate potential causal mechanisms for these circuit- level pathologies by examining the aggregation of specific genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) within three neurotransmitter (dopamine, glutamate and GABA) signaling pathways, axonal guidance pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation pathways based on our preliminary data. Finally, an exploratory aim evaluates whether the expression of cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses is mediated by each individual's total number of rare deletions in DNA (copy number variations; CNVs). To evaluate these hypotheses, 175 continuously recruited PSD patients will complete an extensive clinical battery and undergo multimodal neuroimaging. Evoked and intrinsic hemodynamic activity will be used in conjunction with white matter assays (diffusion tensor imaging) to investigate the integrity and connectivity of the cognitive control circuit (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) during a multisensory cognitive control task with real-world validity. PSD patients will be classified into meaningful entities based on univariate and multivariate indices of grey/white matter pathology in the cognitive control network using a K-means algorithm. We will then determine the predictive validity of these clusters for describing deficits in cognitive control and everyday functioning, using the leave-one-out methodology to verify the model. Thus, the current application utilizes multiple units of analyses (genes, circuits, self-report, behavior, and paradigms) from the NIMH Research Domain Criteria to develop a novel classification system based on neurophysiological and genetic biomarkers of impaired cognitive control that spans traditional diagnostic categories. We are confident that moving beyond traditional nosologies will result in more meaningful diagnoses and ultimately more successful treatments for refractory symptoms, leading to substantial improvements in mental health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Psychotic spectrum (schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and bipolar disorder I with history of psychotic features) disorders (PSD) are a large public health concern that results in tremendous interpersonal and societal costs. Although traditionally classified as separate entities, these diverse disorders share common psychotic symptoms, as well as similar cognitive deficits, disease courses and genetic determinants. However, the underlying reasons (e.g., abnormalities in brain circuitry, genetic make-up, etc.) why PSD patients tend to exhibit similar phenomenological behaviors (e.g., positive symptoms in conjunction with poor cognitive control) have yet to be elucidated. The current proposal will utilize novel analytic methods and neuroimaging techniques to classify PSD patients into meaningful sub-groups based on objective pathology within frontal brain circuits. We will also examine whether behavioral deficits and brain abnormalities are dependent on genetic factors. At the end of this proposal, we will produce a rich, publically available dataset that can be used to increase our collective understanding of these devastating diseases.",A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology,9252586,R01MH101512,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusional disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Hallucinations', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Occupational', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Refractory', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophreniform Disorder', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'axonal guidance', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain circuitry', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic risk factor', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'self reported behavior', 'success', 'white matter']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,594853,0.10460910910337062

"A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are difficult to differentially diagnose and treat, typically leaving their victims with lifetime disability. It is increasingly becoming recognized that traditionally distinct disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychotic features share overlapping symptoms. For example, in addition to positive symptoms, PSD patients also experience deficits in cognitive control/executive functioning, which likely result from dysregulation of the mesocortical and mesostriatal pathways. Importantly, cognitive deficits contribute to deficits in interpersonal and occupational functioning, more traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking) and are currently refractory to treatment. The current application will use novel recruiting strategies and novel multivariate analytic techniques to establish empirical, neuronally-based cluster metrics (i.e., circuit-level pathologies) that are associated with impairments in cognitive control (primary outcome) and everyday functioning (secondary outcome) in PSD regardless of traditional diagnoses (DSM-V). Other potential mediating variables evaluated in the current model include negative symptoms and disorganized thinking. We investigate potential causal mechanisms for these circuit- level pathologies by examining the aggregation of specific genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) within three neurotransmitter (dopamine, glutamate and GABA) signaling pathways, axonal guidance pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation pathways based on our preliminary data. Finally, an exploratory aim evaluates whether the expression of cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses is mediated by each individual's total number of rare deletions in DNA (copy number variations; CNVs). To evaluate these hypotheses, 175 continuously recruited PSD patients will complete an extensive clinical battery and undergo multimodal neuroimaging. Evoked and intrinsic hemodynamic activity will be used in conjunction with white matter assays (diffusion tensor imaging) to investigate the integrity and connectivity of the cognitive control circuit (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) during a multisensory cognitive control task with real-world validity. PSD patients will be classified into meaningful entities based on univariate and multivariate indices of grey/white matter pathology in the cognitive control network using a K-means algorithm. We will then determine the predictive validity of these clusters for describing deficits in cognitive control and everyday functioning, using the leave-one-out methodology to verify the model. Thus, the current application utilizes multiple units of analyses (genes, circuits, self-report, behavior, and paradigms) from the NIMH Research Domain Criteria to develop a novel classification system based on neurophysiological and genetic biomarkers of impaired cognitive control that spans traditional diagnostic categories. We are confident that moving beyond traditional nosologies will result in more meaningful diagnoses and ultimately more successful treatments for refractory symptoms, leading to substantial improvements in mental health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Psychotic spectrum (schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and bipolar disorder I with history of psychotic features) disorders (PSD) are a large public health concern that results in tremendous interpersonal and societal costs. Although traditionally classified as separate entities, these diverse disorders share common psychotic symptoms, as well as similar cognitive deficits, disease courses and genetic determinants. However, the underlying reasons (e.g., abnormalities in brain circuitry, genetic make-up, etc.) why PSD patients tend to exhibit similar phenomenological behaviors (e.g., positive symptoms in conjunction with poor cognitive control) have yet to be elucidated. The current proposal will utilize novel analytic methods and neuroimaging techniques to classify PSD patients into meaningful sub-groups based on objective pathology within frontal brain circuits.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,0.23907560150710142

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse.

"Protein network of high risk copy number variants for psychiatric disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and intellectual disability are major burden to society. Our current knowledge of their underlying pathophysiology remains limited. However, a contribution of genetic factors has been clearly demonstrated. The goal of this study is to discover shared biological mechanisms between autism, schizophrenia and related disorders through investigation of the networks of interactions between proteins encoded by the high risk genetic factors implicated in these disorders.  It is now firmly established that rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs): (1) play significant role in the risk of psychiatric disorders; (2) many high-risk CNVs cross disorder boundaries and are implicated in several psychiatric disorders.

To advance our understanding of CNV contribution to psychiatric diseases, we propose to investigate how the genes from high risk rare CNVs interact on a protein level. The knowledge of the networks connecting CNV genes will help to better understand their pathological impact in different disorders. Using the constructed networks, we will test the hypotheses that: (1) cross-disorder CNVs share interacting protein partners that may explain shared etiology of different disorders; (2) cross-disorder CNVs have a unique set of interacting partners that may explain the differences between disorders.

"Finding single-gene copy number variants in schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder with an elusive pathophysiology and few novel treatments under development. Our understanding of the biological basis of SCZ would be greatly accelerated by the isolation of a substantial number of precise causal mutations that influence risk. Copy number variants (CNVs) are an attractive source for causative mutations since, by altering gene dosage or structure, they provide a clear direction of effect and molecular mechanism. We propose to leverage the power of multiple technologies and large samples used in the Large-Scale Swedish Schizophrenia Association Study funded by NIMH to identify gene- and exon-level CNVs associated with SCZ. Our overarching goal is to discover risk loci resulting from changes in copy number in specific genes that could lead to improved understanding of SCZ. First, we will combine multiple CNV call sets from complimentary technologies to identify gene- and exon-level CNVs nominally associated with SCZ. Data available include genome-wide SNP, exome genotyping arrays and exome sequencing in 5,001 SCZ cases and 6,234 controls. Second, we will integrate the normalized raw data from all three datasets to construct a ""virtual array"" and use a specialized hidden Markov model (VAMM) to survey genic CNVs to yield high-density CNV calls. Third, we will create a prioritized list of gene/exon level CNV associations with SCZ and validate 50 putative CNVs using a precise and high sensitivity independent methodology. Finally, we will evaluate whether validated CNV regions associate with SCZ beyond chance by querying existing genomic data available from a distinct set of 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls. To date, only a few specific genes have been implicated via CNV analysis, all of which provided novel insights into SCZ pathophysiology. We contend that these genes are the tip of an iceberg and the current deficiency is simply attributed to the lack of methods for gene-focused CNV evaluation. If this R21 study can identify even one new exon- or gene-level CNV whose dosage alters SCZ risk, it will represent an important advance in our understanding of the biological basis of SCZ. Any identified CNV would provide the basis for an R01 application to understand the mechanisms linking its dosage to SCZ risk.

"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0.1297242481576025
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,0.22636473504475713

"Disordered Cellular Interactions in Prefrontal Local Circuits: a New Mechanistic Theory of Schizophrenia with Convergent Evidence across Animal Models PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that ranks among the top 10 health burdens worldwide, yet current treatment options are not effective for many patients. In order to develop new therapies, we must gain a better understanding of how the physiology of the brain is altered in the disease. This will require links to be established between pathophysiological processes that occur at the levels of synaptic transmission, neuronal activity patterns, circuit dynamics, information processing, and finally cognitive performance. Our current body of knowledge is based on the two extremes of this spectrum: genetic defects that lead to dysfunction in cellular function on one end, changes in global brain activation patterns and cognitive performance on the other. What we are missing is an intermediate link at the level of neural circuits, or more specifically, an understanding of how distortions of the spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity in schizophrenia ultimately derail the computations performed by the networks, leading to cognitive failure.  A widely-accepted theoretical model of schizophrenia called the disconnection hypothesis posits that the disease results from disordered functional connectivity between brain regions. While some functional imaging evidence supports this theory, it has never been tested at the neuronal circuit level and thus a mechanistic framework has not been developed. Here we propose to test the central hypothesis that schizophrenia is a disease in which aberrant action potential timing in prefrontal circuits leads to weakening of synaptic connections over time, through established mechanisms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.  In the Specific Aim 1, we propose to analyze a previously collected dataset of neuronal activity obtained from nonhuman primates performing a working memory task after receiving a drug that mimics features of schizophrenia. Preliminary analysis of this data suggests that spiking activity is disordered such that cells in the same local circuits are desynchronized and functional connectivity between cell pairs is reduced; these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that spike timing disruption leads to functional disconnection in schizophrenia. We will further develop these analyses and relate them to the disruptions in cognitive processing that parallel those seen in human schizophrenic patients. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to conduct large-scale neural recordings in transgenic mice in order to investigate how a mutation that increases risk for schizophrenia changes the properties of neuronal interactions. We will apply similar analytical techniques to the neural data from Aims 1 and 2 in order to maximize the translational power of both animal models. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we propose to perform computational neural network simulations in order to establish a theoretical framework that causally links disordered spike timing to functional disconnection. The information gained through these studies will form a basis for a new theoretical framework of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia which can be used to guide a rational search for new treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder which affects approximately 1% of the global population, including 3 million Americans, yet current treatments are not effective because we have an insufficient understanding of the pathological mechanisms of the disease. We propose to investigate how aberrant electrical activity leads to changes in local network dynamics and ultimately a breakdown in cognitive processing, using a unique approach that involves analysis of neural data from two animal models of the disease in addition to computational simulations of neuronal networks. This research will provide a new understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia which could be used to identify new targets and strategies for intervention.",Disordered Cellular Interactions in Prefrontal Local Circuits: a New Mechanistic Theory of Schizophrenia with Convergent Evidence across Animal Models,9542379,F30MH108205,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'NMDA receptor antagonist', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Organizational Change', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Model', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive performance', 'evidence base', 'foot', 'functional restoration', 'genome wide association study', 'imaging study', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parallel processing', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe mental illness', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F30,2018,48003,0.1676401291500829
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.

"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.

"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137.

"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia.

"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments.

"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,0.26211406700834544
"A data-driven reconceptualization of the RDoC construct of working memory: Neural correlates of underlying factors and implications for schizophrenia Project Summary / Abstract  Over two decades of research has focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of working memory (WM) deficits in patients with schizophrenia in the hopes of finding effective treatments, as these deficits are more closely linked to functional outcomes in patients than are psychotic symptoms, and they are presumed to arise from alterations in dopaminergic function that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the overwhelming majority of research in this area has treated WM as a unitary cognitive ability that is assayed equally well by any of the wide range of tasks commonly employed in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that at least three distinct cognitive abilities contribute to performance on WM tasks: attentional control, short-term memory capacity, and long-term (or secondary) memory retrieval. These are presumed to have dissociable neural substrates and may be differentially impaired in different patients, which would serve to obscure potential biomarkers of WM deficit in case-control fMRI studies of patients. The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Matrix attempts to capture some of this complexity by defining four subconstructs of WM (active maintenance, flexible updating, limited capacity, and interference controls), although these differ from those based on empirical work described above, and no empirical work to date has attempted to determine the extent to which various WM tasks tap these four putative subconstructs. The overarching goal of this application is to conduct a large-scale latent-variable analysis of the most commonly employed WM tasks in the fMRI literature of schizophrenia, along with a broad array of other cognitive tasks, in order to clarify the underlying cognitive abilities (or subconstructs) that subserve WM task performance and to identify neural correlates of these empirically identified subconstructs. To this end, 500 participants will undergo behavioral testing on 9 WM and 12 other cognitive tasks in order to provide a robust dataset for latent variable analysis using factor analytic and structural equation modeling techniques that will identify the subconstructs that underlie performance on each of the WM tasks. Next, 80 patients with schizophrenia and 80 matched control participants will undergo the same battery of tasks, but will perform 7 of the WM tasks during fMRI scanning, in order to identify neural correlates of the subconstructs that are specifically disrupted in schizophrenia. This work will help to advance our understanding of WM deficits in schizophrenia and will identify specific neural targets, and the optimal tasks that future investigators can employ to target them, that are disrupted in schizophrenia. These neural targets can then form the basis for establishing target engagement in clinical trials aimed at finding treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Project Narrative  Schizophrenia poses a great social and economic burden in a significant percentage of patients, including increased risk for unemployment, homelessness, incarceration, chronic disability, and reduced life expectancy. This disability is thought to be closely related to cognitive deficits in patients. By seeking to better understand the neural basis of these deficits, this application seeks to identify new brain mechanisms that may be targeted by future treatments in order to improve outcomes in this patient group.",A data-driven reconceptualization of the RDoC construct of working memory: Neural correlates of underlying factors and implications for schizophrenia,9970631,R01MH120293,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Economic Burden', 'Equation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Homelessness', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'Update', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior test', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'convolutional neural network', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'functional MRI scan', 'functional outcomes', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'long term memory', 'memory retrieval', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'social', 'treatment research']",NIMH,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,785087,0.18660212621708422
"Systematic Evaluation of the Effects of Cognitive Remediation across Affective and Non-Affective Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia [SZ] and bipolar disorder [BD] are among the most costly and debilitating psychiatric diseases worldwide. Both SZ and BD are associated with marked cognitive deficits, which are among the strongest predictors of poor community functioning, disability, and reduced quality of life (1-3). Cognitive remediation (CR) is one of the few available interventions to target cognitive symptoms directly. Growing evidence indicates that CR improves cognition in patients with these illnesses at the group level (e.g. 4-6). However, a number of critical knowledge gaps limit our ability to develop robust, individualized CR interventions and provide access to patients who are most likely to benefit: first, CR outcomes are highly heterogeneous and predictors of treatment response have not been identified; and second, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that mediate cognitive and functional enhancement remain largely undetermined. CR trials are challenging, as interventions are often lengthy and intensive, and ascertainment and retention of patients with psychotic disorders is difficult. As a result, the majority of CR studies are underpowered to clearly identify predictors of response, compare treatment effects by diagnosis, examine the ability of CR to drive rapid neural change, and determine the extent to which neural change is associated with cognitive or functional outcomes. These knowledge gaps have limited our ability to develop robust, targeted CR programs and deliver them to patients most likely to benefit. The aims of this project are twofold: 1) identification of patient characteristics associated with cognitive treatment response including baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive variables, and multivariate models; and 2) examination of CR's ability to drive rapid, EEG-measured neural change in key information processing systems, and the associations of this change with primary cognitive outcomes. Over the last eight years our group has completed two separate randomized controlled trials of a 70-hour CR program in patients with SZ and BD with funding from NIMH and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. These studies employed identical CR paradigms, active control conditions, primary (cognitive) and secondary (clinical, functional) outcome measures taken at the same timepoints (baseline, midpoint, and post-treatment), and EEG protocols. We will systematically examine moderator of CR response across the sample including demographic, clinical and cognitive variables; we will then use principal components analysis (PCA) with regression to evaluate factors predictive of CR response, compare univariate predictors with our multivariate models, and explore clustering behavior in responders vs. non-responders. Finally, we will examine early effects of CR training on EEG-measured neurophysiology, and the relationship of neural modulation to cognitive response. This project is uniquely positioned to fill critical gaps in the knowledge by merging two related datasets to form a well- powered study able to answer these questions across affective and non-affective psychosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive remediation is a behavioral intervention shown to be effective at targeting the common and disabling cognitive deficits experienced by patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, not all patients respond to treatment, and predictors of treatment response and neurobiological mechanisms of action remain unknown, due in part to the challenging nature of conducting these clinical trials and resulting small samples. Over the last 8 years our group has completed two separate but related clinical trials of cognitive remediation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Thus, we aim to merge these datasets in order to systematically investigate the predictors of cognitive treatment response including multivariate models, and CR's ability to drive rapid, neural change in key information processing systems in order to fill these knowledge gaps and facilitate development of targeted CR programs for patients most likely to benefit.",Systematic Evaluation of the Effects of Cognitive Remediation across Affective and Non-Affective Psychosis,9977312,R03MH120442,"['Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'active control', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sensory gating', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R03,2020,164000,0.08901028357998542
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,9985547,R01MH121411,"['Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'causal model', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'longitudinal course', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'white matter']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,839437,0.09355427169754002
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"4/4 Powering Genetic Discovery for Severe Mental Illness in Latin American and African Ancestries Project Summary Genetic discovery for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lags behind that in other areas of medicine, where the identification of mutations responsible for familial forms of major disorders has yielded extraordinary biological insights. However, recent successes in gene identification from both rare and common variant analyses indicate what the field needs to do to catch up: expand the size, diversity and scope of genetic studies. Indeed, NIMH recognized this need, issuing PAR-20-027, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in Ancestrally Diverse Populations.” In response to this call, we will create the Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness Association Studies (PUMAS) Project, an international collaboration of investigators from the US, South America and Africa with the strongest track record of large-scale psychiatric genetic research in Latino and African populations, along with several of the field’s leaders in genetic data generation and analysis. PUMAS will be well powered to discover new genes for schizophrenia and bipolar; it will dramatically increase the diversity of genetic discovery efforts, an important step towards reducing health disparities; and it will expand the scope of psychiatric genomics by generating low-pass whole genome sequencing for 120,000 samples (which we will analyze together with 22,500 samples already sequenced by our team). Through these efforts we will also discover similarities and differences in genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and environments. The Aims of the PUMAS project are to: 1) Build the PUMAS sample bank of schizophrenia cases, bipolar cases and controls from Africa and from admixed populations in the Americas, achieving a total sample of 183,500 (88,600 cases and 94,900 matched population controls) by recruiting 17,000 new cases and 16,500 controls. 2) Generate low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and variant calls on 40,000 cases of schizophrenia, 40,000 cases of bipolar disorder and 40,000 matched controls from African, Native American and admixed ancestries b) perform extensive sample and variant quality control. 3) a) Systematically analyze the combined dataset to power discovery of the genetic basis of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and down the allele frequency spectrum; and b) through portals and browsers, share the data and results of the genetic studies with the world. The PUMAS 120,000 sample WGS dataset, together with data for 22,500 previously sequenced admixed (AA+EA) samples, provides sufficient statistical power for genetic discovery for SZ, BP, and combined across diverse ancestries. Our study will identify new genes and loci, increase the precision of fine-mapping of known loci, and form the foundational knowledge base for polygenic risk scores (PRS) of global value.
