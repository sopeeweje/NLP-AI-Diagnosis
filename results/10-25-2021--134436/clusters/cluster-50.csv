"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE A new diagnostic procedure for CADUCEUS has been developed, which we believe provides a framework for solving all of the known problems encountered in our use of INTERNIST-1.  During the five year period covered by the current proposal, we intend to pursue the following specific aims:  Revision of the structure of the CADUCEUS knowledge base will be undertaken to support the enhanced capabilities of the new diagnostic procedure.  The revised knowledge base will be expanded to encompass all of the major diseases of internal medicine, and much of neurology.  Evaluation of the new CADUCEUS system will be undertaken in two phases. First, through protocol analytic studies, we intend to study and refine the human/machine interface of CADUCEUS, exploring specifically various modes of cooperative human/machine problem solving.  Subsequently, we plan to carry out formal evaluation studies of the system in order to gauge its diagnostic accuracy, the value of its information gathering and explanatory capability, and its acceptability to a variety of potential client groups.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE Attention and effort on this computer program for consultative diagnosis in medicine have been focused during the past year on two areas primarily, (a) the development of the new CADUCEUS program, and (b) the expansion and updating of the medical knowledge base. Prototypic computer programs have been written for the operation of CADUCEUS and have been preliminarily tested.  A substantial portion of the medical knowledge base (diseases of the liver and biliary tract) has been reorganized in the CADUCEUS format.  The installation of a dedicated VAX computer this summer will allow these programs to be tested critically and then further work can proceed on both elements. The knowledge base in internal medicine has been expanded so that it now includes over 500 diseases and some 3,450 individual manifestations of disease. Many disease entities which were programmed some years ago have been updated. It is gratifying but not unexpected that this expansion and updating have improved the performance of INTERNIST-I.  The pediatrics knowledge base has been significantly expanded also.  Considerable progress has been made on an anatomy knowledge base for utilization in CADUCEUS.  Progress has also been made on the reorganization of the diagnostic program to a form utilizable for educational and testing purposes by medical students and physicians.  Future work will proceed along all of these lines with emphasis on the organization and refinement of the CADUCEUS diagnostic program.  n/a",CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE,3450498,R24RR001101,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical resource', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer center', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis service', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' medical education', ' online computer']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R24,1985,62622,0.10659077001508879
"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.  The great explosion in the accumulation of structural data bears witness that investigators, over 4,000 of them, think that the information is important in their many different fields including virology, immunology, pharmacology, oncology, genetics, genetic engineering, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology.  Protein structures contain important information required for understanding the causes of disease and developing a rational approach to treatment.

"RUTGERS RESEARCH RESOURCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource promotes the development and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg and G. Sharp at the National Library of Medicine and University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have an active collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototyes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analyzer.  We are proposing to continue these micro-based innovations for two applications: the interpretation of CPK/LDH isoenzymes for the diagnosis of heart attacks and a primary eye care program for developing countries.

"HELPSKIN: A NURSING PRESSURE SORE PREVENTION SYSTEM The prevention of decubitus ulcers (DU) requires care by aides who may limited knowledge or experience with the condition they are seeking to prevent.  HELPSKIN is an information resource/directory designed to increase nursing caregivers knowledge of the prevention of DU.  It is designed for location at nursing stations in all facilities serving patients at risk for DU. HELPSKIN is designed to be a computer-based, user friendly, interactive graphics and video system.  The goals of this project are to complete the detailed design of the system, build its data base, construct a working model and determine its effects on the level of knowledge about the prevention of DU of nurses, nursing aides, patients, and home caregivers.  The long-term objective is to develop an expert system integrating patient assessment and patient status monitoring.  If found to be a viable technology, similar resources directories will be add-on features for smart nursing information systems such as UNIS, a nursing expert system on urinary incontinence.  Together, information resource directories and expert system shells will apply smart data base technology for the improvement of long-term care of dependent patients.  n/a",HELPSKIN: A NURSING PRESSURE SORE PREVENTION SYSTEM,3503733,R43NR002594,"['caregivers', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' decubitus ulcer', ' nursing care', ' nursing education', ' patient /disease registry']",NINR,"MULTI-MEDIA SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,1991,50000,0.06413277831480636
"EXPERT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OF A CLINICAL RECORD SYSTEM Beginning over a decade ago this group developed a more or less comprehensive computer based record system for ambulatory care.  The system capitalizes on the touch interactive graphic capabilities of the PLATO computer aided instruction system of the University of Illinois.  though impressive performance was achieved in evaluation, the development environment was not suited to deployment at sites of care.  This proposal is to use expert system capabilities to transfer and refine the system.  When acceptable performance, in terms of flexibility, comprehensiveness, and speed and facility of interaction have been achieved in the development environment, the system will be moved to stand-alone and/or networked terminals of the personal computer class.  Successful development of an economically realistic system will achieve a long elusive objective for the support of clinical care.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM The Committee on Models for Biomedical Research has proposed a ""matrix of biological knowledge"" (Matrix) to address the need for a means to organize and intelligently access the wealth of information that confronts biomedical researchers (c.f. Models for Biomedical Research, National Academy Press, 1985).  To implement the matrix will require a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and database technologies as well as an understanding of the structure of biological knowledge.  However, a full implementation of the Matrix is best not attempted until pilot studies on a restricted domain of knowledge have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the concept.  One domain of considerable general interest is that of nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries, which have become invaluable research tools for a large segment of the biomedical research community. In addition to the libraries themselves a large number of computer programs have been written to analyze the sequence data, which has resulted in major new discoveries.  The utility of these libraries to the typical laboratory investigator could be greatly enhanced by augmenting them with the types of knowledge management and reasoning systems envisioned for the Matrix. The goal of this proposed work is to build a testbed for the Matrix concept on top of the existing sequence libraries, benefitting both the larger goals of the Matrix and the immediate needs of sequence library users.  Steps in this process will include: (1) implementation of the GenBank database in a relational form, interfaced to an AI environment; (2) creation of a series of knowledge bases relating to the database, starting with simple taxonomies and progression to more complex representations (on narrower test domains); (3) creation of a set of user interfaces oriented to the needs of molecular biologist; and (4) investigation of various techniques of inference against the knowledge base, in particular reasoning by analogy, with the ultimate aim of allowing users to build and test hypotheses locally.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM,3421490,R01RR004026,"['DNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' eukaryote', ' genetic library', ' genetic regulatory element', ' information retrieval', ' information systems', ' molecular biology', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,1992,285230,0.0795376210981744

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.  n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES,3373793,R01LM004529,"['AIDS', ' artificial intelligence', ' cell biology', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' cytogenetics', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder classification', ' histopathology', ' immunogenetics', ' immunologic assay /test', ' lymphoma', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,1988,227240,0.03743219717961218

Potential uses include query, browsing, testing, stimulation, didactic instruction, problem solving, and personal file management.  Knowledge is considered to be available in multiple forms, both non-adaptive and adaptive.  A challenge is to assemble units of knowledge of the forms pertinent to a particular domain, organize them to support user needs, provide consistent access to them, and facilitate linkage among them.  This proposal seeks to build on and extend previous work on architectural issues for KM in two principal ways:  (1) To refine and further develop software architectures and methodologies. This research will explore the role of a kernel set of functions to facilitate organization and combination of disparate components in building complex KM applications.  If properly designed, such a kernel can provide a consistent set of services for all applications.  A prototype kernel architecture for KM applications will be designed and tested.  Research issues include methods for decomposition of applications to separate their storage, processing, and presentation components; data base requirements for indexing and composing complex structures from disparate, disjoint data elements; and methods to support multi-user cooperative development. Important goals will be to facilitate functional integration of independently developed units, extensibility, and portability and/or interoperability.  (2) To validate and evaluate the architectures and methodologies.  This will be done principally via on-going participation in collaborative KM applications, where the kernel architecture developed is applied and experience with its use gained, in order to identify problems, delineate other needed capabilities, and prioritize future developments.  In addition, aid will be provided for evaluation activities of the collaborative projects themselves, via development of tools for collecting, summarizing, and analyzing usage data.  In conjunction with the above activities, a number of key non-technical issues will be explored, which bear upon the practical impact of the technical developments.  These include adoption of guidelines for knowledge module definition and interchange; understanding of user information needs and information seeking behavior; and requirements for supporting, maintaining, updating, and disseminating knowledge bases.  The approach to these tasks will be to collect and synthesize experiences, review and analyze those of others, and participate in task forces and workshops aimed at elucidating these issues.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2237628,R01LM004572,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' indexing', ' information display', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' information systems', ' medical education']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,1994,380815,0.046415577775737404

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.

"KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING TOOLS TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE BASES Computer-based expert systems are fast becoming an indispensable part of modern medicine.

However, modeling the decision strategies of human medical experts for such knowledge bases is both dffficult and expensive. We have substantial experience with these problems, as we have created and maintained several important knowledge bases. During this time, we have worked on developing new tools to support and improve the knowledge engineering work. Several of these prototype tools are now almost ready to be applied outside of the laboratory in diverse, everyday knowledge engineering situations. This application proposes to perform the final developmental work required to implement these tools in realistic settings. The application also proposes to experimentally evaluate the tools in these settings. We expect our experimental work will show a significant improvement in the diagnostic reliability, accuracy, and validity of frames when the tools are applied.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.  The work in the proposed project will build on the extensive previous work in drug monitoring done by these investigators in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Stanford and at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.  n/a,MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS,3442446,R18HS005263,"['chemotherapy', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug adverse effect', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care facility information system', ' health care service evaluation', ' hospital patient care', ' online computer', ' physicians']",AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R18,1987,277343,0.06255348730111109

The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.  The work in the proposed project will build on the extensive previous work in drug monitoring done by these investigators in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Stanford and at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.  n/a,MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS,3442445,R18HS005263,"['chemotherapy', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug adverse effect', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care facility information system', ' health care service evaluation', ' hospital patient care', ' online computer', ' physicians']",AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R18,1986,226763,0.06255348730111109

"INTELLIGENT DECISION SYSTEM FOR LUNG DISEASE IN AIDS The proposed research has the broad long-term objective of providing useful      computer-based consultative assistance to clinicians faced with complex          choices among diagnostic and therapeutic options. This advice will be            provided by an intelligent decision system, a computer program employing         artificial intelligence techniques to automate the generation of decision        models and analysis of those models to produce a recommendation. The             advantages of incorporating decision analytic principles are explicit            consideration of uncertainty and patients' preferences, and an axiomatic         approach which links the decision elements to a recommendation. The system       will permit users to control the elements of a decision model and will thus      constitute a decision analysis workbench rather than a traditional expert        system.                                                                                                                                                           The project will focus on the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in             patients with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or suspected         AIDS. This is an important and increasingly common problem which involves        high stakes for individual patients and a bewildering array of diagnostic        and therapeutic options with complex trade-offs for clinicians. In this          medical area, knowledge of disease prognoses and efficacy of therapy is          rapidly accumulating. Thus, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies must           continuously evolve in response to new data.                                                                                                                      The system is to be implemented in the Common LISP programming language on       an Intel 80386-based microcomputer. The system will employ separate              knowledge bases for decision analytic knowledge and medical domain               knowledge. The modularity inherent in this organization will facilitate          expansion and refinement of the knowledge base in response to new research       findings and the availability of new techniques. The system will use a           frame-based representation of diseases, diagnostic tests and treatments.         These frames and their relations will determine the alternatives and             outcomes modeled by the system. A network representation of probabilistic        dependencies will ensure that the consistent updating of probabilities is        performed in each decision tree context. Generation of a decision model          will be guided by context-dependent rules which will determine at any given      point in the tree which events to consider and how deeply to expand the          decision model. The system will also contain facilities to tailor                preference functions and probabilities to individual patients.

"BIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE-BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Biomedical researchers are generating vast amounts of data and knowledge,        at an accelerating pace.  Neither existing database systems nor existing         frame knowledge representation systems have the capabilities required to         support the development of large, shared repositories of biological              information.  Therefore, SRI International proposes to integrate database        and knowledge-representation technology to develop a biological                  knowledge-base management system (KBMS) with unprecedented power to en-          code biological knowledge.

"SPATIAL/SYMBOLIC BRAIN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION (Taken from project abstract):  In the past two decades new          imaging technology has given neurologists noninvasive tools which reveal the     structure of the brain with a clarity that is little short of miraculous.        At the same time, neuroscientists, often in animal studies, have developed       ways to reveal hundreds of chemical and functional features of the brain         that are relevant to human brain function.  The problem of integrating new       knowledge to the benefit of human patients is exploding in both magnitude        and complexity.                                                                                                                                                   This project addresses that problem by developing a Brain Information            Management System for knowledge obtained from human and non-human primate        research.  The system will allow the most precise possible indexation of         written and pictorial information into a knowledge base that is accessible       through the standard terminology of the National Library of Medicine's           Unified Medical Language System.

"KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DISTRIBUTED CARDIAC IMAGE BASES DESCRIPTION (taken from application abstract):  Heart disease continues          to be the primary cause of death in the U.S., with 25% of all deaths             related to coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition to the loss of             irreplaceable human life, there are also staggering health care costs            and losses in productivity associated with the 1.5 million myocardial            infarctions suffered in the U.S. every year.  The present competing              renewal application seeks to make a contribution toward this vital               health care problem by exploring frontier computing methods to support           and facilitate CAD assessment.  The objective of the proposed research           is to develop and evaluate a methodology to accomplish the following             specific aims:                                                                                                                                                    (1)Knowledge Discovery: To design, implement and test novel database             (DB) ""mining"" algorithms to uncover associations and inferences imbedded         in clinical DBs and which can improve diagnostic performance.                    (2)Knowledge Base Enrichment: To use the knowledge resulting from DB             mining as well as conventional knowledge-acquisition methods to create           and evaluate a robust knowledge base (KB) with which to interpret                cardiovascular SPECT imagery and other types of relevant, patient-               specific information.                                                            (3)Distributed Knowledge Discovery and Processing:  To extend both the           Knowledge-discovery and knowledge-based processing methods to                    distributed, Internet-based setting for a twofold purpose: (I) to                provide users with widespread access to the resulting KB, and (ii) to            access and mine remote multi center DBs to further improve our knowledge         regarding the assessment of CAD.                                                                                                                                  The proposed work represents pioneering research in several ways,                especially: (I) the creation of innovative algorithms to mine image DBs,         (II) the application of these algorithms to the clinical assessment of           CAD, and (III) the creation of distributed DB mining and knowledge-based         processing methods to link geographically dispersed users and clinical           DBs.  The proposed research builds on our previous work on knowledge-            guided image interpretation, and represents an interinstitutional and            interdisciplinary effort between Georgia Tech and Emory University, a            longstanding collaboration that has previously resulted in numerous              joint publications and valuable insights centering on diagnostic                 imaging, and which has also supported several academic degrees.                   n/a",KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DISTRIBUTED CARDIAC IMAGE BASES,6351635,R01LM006726,"['Internet', ' angiography', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular imaging /visualization', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer data analysis', ' coronary disorder', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' heart disorder diagnosis', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' myocardium', ' perfusion', ' single photon emission computed tomography']",NLM,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2001,362213,0.05286397812359798

"Decision Support Systems for MAG3 Renography  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current health care system requires physicians to master an ever-expanding knowledge base while the hours available to master this knowledge base and apply it to specific tasks (e.g., image interpretation, seeing a new patient) are steadily shrinking. The convergence of an expanding knowledge base and escalating time constraints poses a serious problem that will inevitably lead to physician errors.   Solutions to this problem require the development of new tools and processes to save physician time and facilitate the application of a broad and sophisticated knowledge base to speci5c clinical problems.

Specijkally, we hypothesize that we can develop Decision Support Systems to interpret adult MAG3 scans as well as a panel of experts. We have chosen to develop Decision Support Systems for MAG3 renography because (1) the vast majority of the estimated 400,000 radionuclide renal scans performed annually in the United States are interpreted by radiologists who lack the time to develop the needed expertise and (2) MAG3 is used in over 70% of studies. We propose to develop two separate Decision Support Systems using totally different approaches, a heuristic model (knowledge based expert system) and a predictive statistical system. These Systems will be developed from a database of 3500-4000 MAG3 studies and will be designed to acquire the study, generate images and curves from a dynamic radionuclide renogram, check for errors, extract the relevant quantitative data and then use these data to interpret the study. Moreover, the user will be able to query the Systems to obtain the supporting data and rules justifying a specific interpretation. The heuristic and predictive statistical approaches will clarify the relative merits of each approach and will provide a template for the development and application of similar diagnostic and educational aids in the future.   Finally, the Decision Support Systems will allow us to calculate the incremental contribution each parameter makes to the diagnostic accuracy, delete superfluous measurements, minimize the time and effort required to acquire, process and interpret renal scans, provide an objective analysis of renogram data, facilitate wide dissemination of interpretative criteria, foster standardized interpretation, teach physicians and trainees to perform and interpret renal scans as competently as experts, encourage more appropriate utilization and, most of all, improve the accuracy of MAG3 scan interpretation and thereby enhance the care of nephro-urology patients.   n/a",Decision Support Systems for MAG3 Renography,6927223,R01LM007595,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'interactive multimedia', 'kidney imaging /visualization', 'patient oriented research']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,314640,0.049571747456739874

"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,0.06593769482945318
"Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags Project Summary Cost-effective, and accurate sequencing of RNA, composed of both canonical and modified bases, of any length, without conversion to cDNA, and without amplification are the objectives of this project, and the ultimate goal is to sequence the transcriptome, and determine in a time-sensitive manner relative distribution of its components. Such accomplishment will directly impact prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease and materialize the promise of personalized medicine. Current methods, such as Illumina's RNA-Seq, and the single molecule approaches of Pacific Biosciences and of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, still lag behind in many of the critical attributes mentioned above. The unresolved issue with nanopore-based sequencing is the observation that ion current vs. time recording does not refer to a single nucleobase, but to a short sequence of 4 or more bases. The problem, partially resolved with the use of sophisticated algorithms and learning machines, appears intractable for RNA that includes numerous post-transcriptional base modifications. As an illustration, if a nanopore reads a sequence of 4 bases and the specific RNA to be sequenced has a total of 8 different nucleobases (4 canonical and 4 modified), then 48 = 65,536 signals need to be discriminated from within an ion current range of 20 to 40 pA with a standard deviation of ±1 pA; this is an impossible computational task. However, if the nanopore could sense one base at a time and yield distinct ion current for each base, there will be only 8 different recordings to distinguish from, a much simpler task. Our own published results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides conjugated with a pyrimidine-specific tag (Osmium tetroxide 2,2'-bipyrimidine or OsBp) yield enzyme-free, slow/readable translocation via α- Hemolysin, and distinct ion current levels for intact, T(OsBp), and C(OsBp) bases, suggesting that a single tag can yield sequencing information on purine, T, and C. The latter leads to the conjecture that the presence of a second, purine-specific, label would allow identification of all four canonical bases. Furthermore each tag has intrinsic selectivity for one base over another, and this will provide a handle for additional discrimination among the modified bases. In this phase I proposal we aim to demonstrate (i) near 100% labeling (true positives) with 0% internucleotide bond cleavage, and 0% false positives for RNA(OsBp), as we have already shown for DNA(OsBp), (ii) comparable labeling attributes for a purine-specific tag, and (iii) readable translocation with single pyrimidine base discrimination for RNA(OsBp). Success in these efforts will lead to single base discrimination and sequencing of RNA, including a number of post-transcriptionally modified bases, and pave the road for sequencing the transcriptome. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in personalized medicine for diagnosis and treatment of disease require sequencing the RNA transcriptome with technologies that are currently unavailable.

"Addressing gaps in clinically useful evidence on drug-drug interactions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) represent a significant causality for adverse drug events. Unfortunately, current resources for providers are incomplete and inaccurate. We propose a new PDDI knowledge representation paradigm that we hypothesize will yield more clinically relevant evidence than is currently possible. Starting from our extensive body of preliminary work, we will build a framework that implements the new paradigm using statins and psychotropics (antidepressants and antipsychotics). We expect that the framework will be generalizable to PDDIs involving other drugs, including those predicted using methods from pharmacology and bioinformatics. We will advance three research aims while building the exemplar framework. The first research aim is to derive a new meta-data standard for representing PDDI knowledge that satisfies the information needs of pharmacist working in different care settings. An information needs inquiry will result in clinical scenarios that will then inform, and later validate, the new standard. We will design the standard so that it reflects the best thinking of Semantic Web community and will have a high likelihood of widespread adoption. We will then combine the new standard with semantic annotation and best practices for publishing Linked Data to create a Semantic Web knowledge base of statin and psychotropic PDDIs. The second research aim is to compare PDDI evidence on the Semantic Web with existing PDDI knowledge resources for completeness, accuracy and currency. We will validate a mechanism for linking statin and psychotropic PDDI assertions to relevant evidence on the Semantic Web. Because pharmacogenomics can impact many PDDIs, we will also link to an interoperable representation of this evidence. Two pharmacists will then compare the coverage and quality of the PDDI evidence on the Semantic Web with three existing resources using a new PDDI evidence scoring tool. The third research aim is to investigate a process for filling in gaps in clinically useful PDDI knowledge that cannot be filled with available evidence. We will utilize a consensus-based approach to select high priority PDDIs and evaluate their clinical relevance by retrospective cohort studies. We will extend the Linked Data PDDI knowledge base with the results of these studies, and make the knowledge base publicly available via a pilot web portal. The proposed work will contribute to public health by making more effective use of PDDI evidence, filling in important gaps in drug safety knowledge, and spurring innovations in drug information retrieval.

"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions.

Work completed indicates that electrophoretic procedures can replace most of the batteries of biochemical cultural tests and many different media now required for accurate identification of bacteria.  Development of data phase and computer pattern-recognition program promises to effect a substantial saving in labor, material, and analytical time, and to obtain bacterial identification with greater accuracy than is obtained with most current identification systems using classical phenotypic tests.  n/a",RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF CLINICAL BACTERIA,3126095,R01AI015244,"['artificial intelligence', ' bacteria', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' gel electrophoresis', ' genetic strain', ' microorganism classification', ' microorganism culture', ' microorganism resource /registry', ' rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,1985,93316,0.05055462788731283
"Efficient Design and Analytic Strategies for Enhancing the Power of Detecting G X    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR- 11-032 on Methods and Approaches for Detection of Gene- Environment Interactions in Human Disease (R21). The proposal will be led by multiple PIs, Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan and Dr. Jinbo Chen at the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Stephen B. Gruber, Dr. Sung Kyun Park and Dr. Naisyin Wang from the University of Michigan are key clinical and methodological consultants on the project. In this proposal, we will have two specific aims: (i) Evaluate efficient two-phase design and analysis choices in the post genomewide association studies (GWAS) era where additional genotyping or biomarker data is collected on a prioritized selection of a sub-sample of study subjects in an existing study base. This includes the possibility of using supplementary data on cases and controls with only genetic or environmental data. The methods are guided by modern retrospective likelihood framework. (ii) Develop methods for screening of interaction in cohort studies using a novel technique developed by the PIs called ""Principal Interactions Analysis"". This method is based on a parsimonious low rank representation of the interaction matrix after fitting additive main effects of gene and environment. The proposal plans to extend this method to longitudinal studies to capture time- varying effects of interaction. Visual diagnostics to identify time-windows of critical importance will be developed as a byproduct. The planned work in this important proposal will meaningfully contribute to the mission of this FOA, and advance study design and analytical techniques for studying G x E effects. The proposal will involve active collaboration between Dr. Chen and Dr. Mukherjee, their doctoral/post-doctoral trainees and foster collaboration between two peer institutions: University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan. The proposal lies in the intersection of statistics, medicine, epidemiology and human genetics in terms of methodology development. The broader impact is better understanding of disease etiology and identify potentials for targeted intervention strategies.        This proposal is submitted in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR- 11-032 on Methods and Approaches for Detection of Gene-Environment Interactions in Human Disease (R21). The proposal is lead by multiple PD/PI, Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee at the University of Michigan and Dr. Jinbo Chen at the University of Pennsylvania. Synergism of genes and environment plays an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. This proposal addresses important study design and analytical challenges for efficient detection of gene-environment interactions in epidemiological studies. In the first specific aim, we consider design and analytical methods associated with strategies for selection of cases/controls for additional genotyping or collection of biomarker data in existing study bases. In the second specific aim, we consider a highly novel strategy for exploring interactions in longitudinal studies, based on a singular value decomposition of the residual interaction contrast matrix after removing additive effects.

"Efficient Design and Analytic Strategies for Enhancing the Power of Detecting G X    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR- 11-032 on Methods and Approaches for Detection of Gene- Environment Interactions in Human Disease (R21). The proposal will be led by multiple PIs, Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan and Dr. Jinbo Chen at the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Stephen B. Gruber, Dr. Sung Kyun Park and Dr. Naisyin Wang from the University of Michigan are key clinical and methodological consultants on the project. In this proposal, we will have two specific aims: (i) Evaluate efficient two-phase design and analysis choices in the post genomewide association studies (GWAS) era where additional genotyping or biomarker data is collected on a prioritized selection of a sub-sample of study subjects in an existing study base. This includes the possibility of using supplementary data on cases and controls with only genetic or environmental data. The methods are guided by modern retrospective likelihood framework. (ii) Develop methods for screening of interaction in cohort studies using a novel technique developed by the PIs called ""Principal Interactions Analysis"". This method is based on a parsimonious low rank representation of the interaction matrix after fitting additive main effects of gene and environment. The proposal plans to extend this method to longitudinal studies to capture time- varying effects of interaction. Visual diagnostics to identify time-windows of critical importance will be developed as a byproduct. The planned work in this important proposal will meaningfully contribute to the mission of this FOA, and advance study design and analytical techniques for studying G x E effects. The proposal will involve active collaboration between Dr. Chen and Dr. Mukherjee, their doctoral/post-doctoral trainees and foster collaboration between two peer institutions: University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan. The proposal lies in the intersection of statistics, medicine, epidemiology and human genetics in terms of methodology development. The broader impact is better understanding of disease etiology and identify potentials for targeted intervention strategies.        This proposal is submitted in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR- 11-032 on Methods and Approaches for Detection of Gene-Environment Interactions in Human Disease (R21). The proposal is lead by multiple PD/PI, Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee at the University of Michigan and Dr. Jinbo Chen at the University of Pennsylvania. Synergism of genes and environment plays an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. This proposal addresses important study design and analytical challenges for efficient detection of gene-environment interactions in epidemiological studies. In the first specific aim, we consider design and analytical methods associated with strategies for selection of cases/controls for additional genotyping or collection of biomarker data in existing study bases. In the second specific aim, we consider a highly novel strategy for exploring interactions in longitudinal studies, based on a singular value decomposition of the residual interaction contrast matrix after removing additive effects.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A HEPARIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Heparin is a direct acting anticoagulant that has been used for the treatment of thromboembolic conditions for over 30 years.  The major problems with therapy include overanticoagulation leading to bleeding episodes, and underanticoagulation resulting in thrombus formation.  The incidence of these problems in hospitalized patients ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Rick factors for bleeding include age, dose, alcohol use, sex and renal function.  Individualization of heparin therapy is currently based on empirical judgment.  No method employing current computer technologies and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling techniques has been developed to assist in anticoagulating patients receiving heparin.  Biotrack is developing products to assist in the management of patients with thromboembolic diseases. The first of these, Warfcalc, has already been developed and tested in patients treated with the oral anticoagulant, Warfarin.  The purpose of this project is to extend Biotrack's expertise in developing expert systems for anticoagulation to heparin.  This would involve developing a large population base for heparin which would define the best model for describing heparin's dynamics and kinetics.  Biotrack proposes in Phase I to develop the population base for heparin and to develop a prototype expert system for predicting heparin response.  In Phase II Biotrack would test prospectively the performance of such a program in a randomized clinical trial against standard medical therapy.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A HEPARIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,3500789,R43HL035983,"['anticoagulants', ' cardiovascular disorder chemotherapy', ' cardiovascular pharmacology', ' computer assisted patient care', ' drug metabolism', ' heparin', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' thromboembolism']",NHLBI,"BIOTRACK, INC.",R43,1986,50000,0.005692452034615511
"STRUCTURAL PATTERN ANALYSIS OF HUMAN G-BANDED CHROMOSOME This is a proposal to extend substantially a method of structural pattern analysis of human G-banded chromosomes by computer.  A database of 6985 digitized profiles of chromosomes will be used.  Individual profiles are filtered and mapped into a string representation which emphasizes band transitions.  Dynamic programming is used to compute optimal (maximum probability) string alignments, both to infer a model (a finite Markcv chain) from learning samples and to classify by chromosome type in recognition experiments.  Use of this method will be extended to more detailed analysis of structure.  In particular, automatically determining p-q vs. q-p orientation and locating the centromere will be investigated.  To increase the speed of computation, constraining the dynamic programming such that unlikely alignments are not computed and reducing the size of networks by removing nodes labelled with very low frequency of occurrence will be investigated.  To make use of higher level knowledge about the chromosome complement of human cells, the structural models will be incorporated into a knowledge-based program which uses the structural analysis together with the knowledge base for analysis at the level of individual cells.  This will be a step towards an integrated system of multilevel analysis.  This work will further the understanding of structural pattern analysis of the band patterns and will increase the information about individual chromosomes provided by this analysis.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.

"GRAPHICALLY DRIVEN CREATION OF CLINICAL ADVICE PROGRAMS The proposed Phase II SBIR project will extend, refine, and test CAS-2, a tool for building and running clinical advice programs, which was developed as a prototype in Phase I of this project CAS-2 currently allows a clinical knowledge base (KB) to be 1) built, 2) edited, and 3) run for test purposes, all using the graphical user interface (GUI) of a Macintosh computer running the 4th Dimension (4D) database package. The proposed project will refine, extend, and test CAS-2 in a number of ways. 1) CAS-2 will be used to build several different types of KBs to help determine what types of data and logic are required to deal with a range of clinical KBs. 2) The data and logic allowed in CAS-2 will be extended. 3) CAS-2 will be extended to allow images and graphical figures. 4) CAS-2 will be extended to allow the KB to be run operationally using the native GUI of a variety of machines (including Macintoshes and PCs with MS Windows) using XVT, a commercial interface-building package. In addition, CAS-2 will allow the KB to be run operationally in character-interface mode allowing access via telephone modem and via wide-area network. 5) A mode will be created which allows a CAS-2-based clinical advisor to be invoked in client-server mode, allowing any relevant clinical data already online to be passed automatically to the program. 6) Testing will include alpha- testing in collaboration with the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, and later beta-testing at other institutions.  n/a",GRAPHICALLY DRIVEN CREATION OF CLINICAL ADVICE PROGRAMS,2185779,R44GM048289,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer human interaction', ' computer network', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' method development', ' online computer', ' personal computers']",NIGMS,"MEDICAL DECISION ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,1994,249051,0.04018623771768735
"GRAPHICALLY-DRIVEN CREATION OF CLINICAL ADVICE PROGRAMS The proposed project will develop and test a template-driven graphical user interface designed to facilitate the creation of clinical advice- giving programs by clinician domain experts.  The interface will be built on a Macintosh computer using XVT, a commercial interface-building tool, and will be integrated with the existing Clinical Advisor Shell (CAS) developed by researchers at the Yale Center for Medical Informatics.  The proposed interface will allow the domain expert to develop a knowledge base (KB) for input to CAS in a structured fashion, where he is guided through each step by graphical menus from which he can select desired options.  When the domain expert wants to run the program, he will click on a graphical button and the knowledge base will be automatically transformed into a text file and input to the CAS, which will in turn automatically generate a working program.  The domain expert will then be able to enter test cases into the advice-giving program and test and debug it in operation.  Once the proposed XVT interface is developed and integrated with the CAS, it will be tested by entering the knowledge base of two working advice-giving programs, COAG- ADVISOR and of HEPATITIS-ADVISOR, through the interface.  Finally, the domain experts of those programs will assist in the process of refining and polishing the interface.  n/a",GRAPHICALLY-DRIVEN CREATION OF CLINICAL ADVICE PROGRAMS,3498832,R43GM048289,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation']",NIGMS,"MEDICAL DECISION ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,1992,50000,0.06114416612670015
"INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER FOR CLINICAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS We propose proof-of-concept research on a Real-Time Expert System that will: 1) capture data from the computer that presently controls a clinical laboratory's testing or research ; 2) perform sophisticated analyses of incoming results; 3) make routine test or experiment control decisions of the sort presently made by the clinician-scientist (basing them on the clinician's priorities, reasoning methods, statistical criteria and rules of thumb, all of which are encoded in the expert system's knowledge base as a hierarchical set of interdependent hypotheses; 4) either directly command the present control computer to implement its decisions, allowing the clinician or technician to manipulate priorities and high level control variables to influence the testing or research protocol; 5) or convey recommendations to the clinician or technician so he may make the ultimate decisions.  We expect that our intelligent controller will autonomously determine when statistically valid results have been accumulated, recognize and repeat defective or failed measurements, appropriately alter experiment or test parameters and protocol depending on accumulated results, and in the case of clinical research, recognize unexpected opportunities and adjust protocol to take advantage of them.  Our aims in Phase I are to demonstrate feasibility of our product by modifying the knowledge base of our prototype intelligent controller to receive data over a network connection to a laboratory computer at Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary and render experiment-control recommendations concerning a particular auditory neurophysiology experiment.  We will evaluate our distributed-computing control concept, evaluate the quality and timeliness of experiment control recommendations, and identify modifications of architecture to facilitate our phase II research, and identify software tools that we must construct to facilitate our Phase III efforts.  Our system should improve experiment or test flow decisions by increasing the sophistication of analysis on which they are based; it should improve productivity and cost-effectiveness of clinical research that is amenable to computer control.  n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER FOR CLINICAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS,2187092,R43GM049545,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' electrophysiology', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,NOVA SCIENTIFIC,R43,1993,50000,0.029801708810464334

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0.031160944204010103
"Early Origins of Child Obesity: Bridging Disciplines and Phases of Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conference Objectives. This conference will forge a next-step research agenda related to the early origins of childhood obesity. This research agenda will include working with an array of factors (from genetic determinants to societal ones) along a continuum from prenatal life to age 7. The conference will offer a unique opportunity to facilitate communication and planning of future work among a variety of researchers whose work separately addresses different periods in early life. Program. Over the span of 2 days, speakers will address existing, critical research topics in sessions organized by age range: prenatal, the first two years of life, and ages 2-7 years. Within each age range, the selected topics are those that are currently most salient. These include, for example, LGA and maternal adiposity, Biomarkers of abnormal fetal growth, Nutrition, Infant/child factors, Parent/ household factors, and Activity factors (including the environment). Speakers were identified after an exhaustive search of the literature; all are leaders in the field. Developments or contributions the conference might stimulate. The conference will set a path for integrated investigation that can lead to reduced prevalence, severity, co-morbidities, and disparities in childhood obesity. It should affect both investigator initiated research and related grant proposals, and also calls for proposals from varied research funding sources. Timeliness A 2008 report that identifies priorities in childhood obesity research has identified prenatal and early childhood top priorities. (Byrne et al. 2008) Breakthroughs in childhood obesity prevention and control will need to integrate knowledge across these traditional divides. Postponement of this bridge-building risks dead-end research and slowed progress. Usefulness to the scientific community. It is virtually impossible for any one investigator-or even one investigative team-to master the full range of knowledge relevant to the development of early childhood obesity. The proposed conference will provide a shared knowledge base that crosses disciplines, and so will provide varied investigators with insight into gaps in their own work. Further, it will provide for networking and linkage that can fill those gaps going forward. Finally, it will produce a research agenda that will build on all the relevant disciplines and that can, as a result, help to guide cross-disciplinary work in the coming years.       Public Health Relevance: Childhood obesity prevalence has risen to unprecedented levels. Obese children are likely to suffer lifelong obesity and associated co-morbidities, with huge tolls to individuals, families, communities, and the health care system. Breakthroughs in childhood obesity prevention and control requires integration of knowledge across traditional area of inquiry, defined by subject age and investigator discipline. The proposed conference will convene investigators across these divides. It will establish a shared information base and research agenda to hasten identification of steps in the obesity causal sequence that are amenable to interruption. The result should be better research and so improved primary prevention and slowed progression of childhood obesity.            Childhood obesity prevalence has risen to unprecendented levels.

"The Cognitive Atlas: Developing an Interdisciplinary Knowledge Base Through Socia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research aims to develop a framework for integrating knowledge about brain, mind, and behavior across multiple disciplines, which we refer to as a }cognitive atlas."" This framework extends the existing knowledge and software architecture for neuroanatomic atlas development that has been established and is now under major development in the UCLA Center for Computational Biology (CCB). A comprehensive approach to understanding mental illness requires translation between syndrome, cognition, behavior, and biology, but increasing specialization within each of these domains hinders interdisciplinary communication, insights and discoveries. The proposed project aims to bridge these gaps by developing a system for the representation of knowledge about cognitive tasks, cognitive processes, and brain structure. We propose to harness new technologies for collaborative knowledge-building along with automated methods of literature mining, to develop a flexible web-based system that will support the consolidation of distributed knowledge about cognitive phenotypes and allow creation of multi-level interdisciplinary links. This system will provide the foundation for involvement of experts in the formalization of their domain knowledge.

"Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes Komor – Project Summary/Abstract - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes”  While targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) that rely on the initial introduction of double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations (indels), particularly when attempting to correct point mutations. Recently, a class of genome editing agents called single base editors was developed that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a dCas9-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases within a ~5 nucleotide window determined by the protospacer. Two classes of editors have been developed that use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. Here we propose the development and characterization of new base editors capable of facilitating new point mutations using methylation chemistry. We have use a bioinformatic approach to identify RNA modifying enzymes that have the potential to be repurposed into new base editors, and have rationally designed mutant libraries to use with directed evolution to convert these enzymes into base editors (Aim 1). Concurrently, we are developing a machine learning program that utilizes existing ssDNA modifying enzymes to identify putative mutations that will expand the substrate scope of the identified methyltransferases to ssDNA (Aim 2). Mutations identified from both strategies will then be tested and characterized for base editing in multiple orthogonal systems (Aim 3). The successful completion of the proposed work will represent a significant addition to existing base editing technologies, and will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install two additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells, allowing researchers to quickly and effectively general model systems for the study of human genetic diseases. Komor – Project Narrative - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes” Base editing enables high efficiency genomic point mutation introduction in a variety of cell types and has the potential to allow researchers to better study human genetic diseases. We propose transformative improvements to current base editing technologies that will expand the types of point mutations that can be introduced by base editors. The tools developed here will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells for the study and potential treatment of human genetic diseases.",Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes,9876634,R21GM135736,"['Adenine', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Deamination', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferase', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Point Mutation', 'Program Development', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Pyrimidine', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfer RNA', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'cell type', 'combat', 'design', 'genome editing', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleobase', 'preference', 'programs', 'tool', 'transition mutation', 'transversion mutation']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,205479,-0.05342999260459526
