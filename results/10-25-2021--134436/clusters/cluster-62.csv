"Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While density-functional calculations of the energy are now feasible for biomolecules, the use of density-functional geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation of conventional density-functional geometry optimizers is that the cost of the geometry optimization scales at least quadratically with the number of atoms in the molecule. In contrast the energy at a fixed geometry can be evaluated for a cost which scales linearly with molecule size, enabling very large molecules to be treated. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for density-functional geometry optimization, potentially reducing the total cost from quadratic to linear in molecule size and enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The proposed algorithm resembles a conventional self-consistent calculation of the energy at a fixed geometry but at convergence the proposed algorithm yields not only the density but also the optimized geometry. This is achieved by simultaneous optimization of the wavefunction and the geometry via a modified self-consistent-field procedure. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the QChem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through QChem Inc. and Spartan Inc.           n/a",Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules,6583907,R43GM067335,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' molecular dynamics', ' molecular size', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2003,99639,0.242287423
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,9943364,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328440,0.220882232
"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10143838,R01GM140635,"['Acute Liver Failure', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'adduct', 'adverse drug reaction', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'drug modification', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver injury', 'mathematical model', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395313,0.216929459
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs.

"Feasibility study: endoscopic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for in s    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular imaging is an emerging technology that can provide information beyond physical appearance of living tissues by detecting molecular signatures in a noninvasive way. This technology can be highly useful for diagnosis, biopsy or surgical guidance, and optimization of preclinical and clinical tests of medication. Among various molecular imaging technologies, Raman spectroscopy is particularly interesting because it is safe, inexpensive, agent-free, and most importantly, capable of detecting multiple molecules simultaneously. Ordinary Raman spectroscopy, however, has a significant drawback, i.e. low sensitivity. Placing nanometallic structures in close proximity with molecules can augment the Raman signal enormously. Utilization of this surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has a great potential for the molecular imaging. However, it has been only demonstrated in a setting of an external Raman microscope with nanoparticles injected into small animals. Although these demonstrations show promises of in situ SERS, to implement the method in a clinical setting, it has to be used in conjunction with endoscopy to circumvent the penetration limit of light. As a beginning effort along that line, the project will examine the feasibility of in situ contact-type endoscopic SERS. The project will begin with fabrication of nanometallic structures for SERS. More specifically, four different methods will be attempted, aiming at large surface enhancement, good uniformity, and low fabrication cost. Those methods are 1) nano-molding with nanoporous silicon, 2) nano-molding with nanospheres, 3) mask shape transfer etching after nanosphere lithography, and 4) room-temperature deposition of carbon nanotube (CNT) film. The SERS substrates will be characterized in various aspects, and compared to one another. The endoscopic SERS probe head will be developed, which is comprised of a SERS substrate, a graded- index lens, an optical fiber, and a housing. These components will be assembled and packaged after alignment. Its characteristics will be examined by using a Raman spectrometer system built in-house, which consists of a laser, a dichroic mirror, lenses, a linear CCD array, and a computer. Developed SERS probes will become a core component for the next phase of research, starting from ex vivo SERS imaging. Since the enhancement of SERS shows strong dependence on the distance between the target molecules and the nanometallic surfaces, it is critically important to examine the effect of interfering materials to the imaging, to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. For this, Raman study of the Barrett's esophagus by Shetty et al will be used as a model, which identified DNA, glycogen, oleic acid, and actin as diagnostic signature substances for the disease. Viscous fluids and/or self-assembled monolayers will be placed between the target molecules and SERS probes, simulating interfering materials. Minimum detectable concentration level will be studied for each type of molecules. A mixture of molecules with various mixing ratio will be examined also with a SERS probe and the principal component analysis to assess the accuracy of the method.        Endoscopic probes that induce and detect wavelength change caused by interaction between molecules and nanometric metal surfaces are expected to play significant role in diagnosis and treatment for a considerable patient population. High sensitivity and high specificity are expected from this type of probe that can read the molecular signatures at the surface of organs. This investigation will probe the feasibility of this new approach.

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients.

"Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence Project Summary The lack of accurate and reliable techniques for visualizing and quantifying the delivery and uptake (pharmacokinetics) of small molecules into the skin has been a major challenge in the development of both new and generic topical drugs. This is particularly true in the measurement of bioequivalence, where a generic drug candidate must be compared against a reference brand-label drug. Current methods, which rely on expensive, destructive, and bulk measurements do not provide the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to extract pharmacokinetic profiles to determine equivalence of drugs at the cellular level over time in human skin. New tools, which allow for direct, real-time quantification of pharmacokinetics non-invasively in humans are needed to drive innovation in the topical drug space. Pharmacokinetic Tomography (PKT) is a method of generated three-dimensional, real-time maps of various molecular species such as lipids, water, proteins and drugs in tissue using spectroscopic imaging techniques. These imaging techniques make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrations of drug molecules to track their uptake quantitatively without the need for labels or alterations to molecular structure. This proposal will develop new coherent Raman imaging tools to create a platform for quantifying the behavior of drugs in ex vivo human skin. This PKT-based platform will be able to measure the uptake of drugs such as antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, steroids, retinoids and NSAIDs in the skin with sub-cellular and sub-second time resolution to glean critical pharmacokinetic parameters needed for drug development and bioequivalence measurements. To compare PKT to an FDA-recognized standard, these PKT imaging will be carried out alongside dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM), a skin fluid sampling technique that measures the concentration of drugs over time.

"Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy NIH-R15 “Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy” Project Summary Fluorescence optical microscopy is one of the most important tools available for the study of biological systems at the cellular level. Unfortunately, due to diffraction phenomena the resolution of fluorescence microscopes in the lateral dimension is limited to about 250 nm. As many biological structures within cells are much smaller than this, increasing resolution is of prime importance. Although several methods are now available which are able to extend the resolution of optical microscopes beyond the diffraction limit, imaging live cells with these methods remains a major challenge. Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which can achieve a resolution of approximately 100 nm, is a suitable super-resolution method for imaging live cells. However, adoption of this technique by biologists is hindered by the inflexible equipment and artifact-prone image analysis algorithms which are currently available. The solution to this problem demands innovations in both optical design and in data processing methods which are used in SIM. Another new method, single molecule localization microscopy, achieves much higher resolution. Although live cell imaging has been demonstrated using single molecule localization approaches, applicability of this method in live cell studies is extremely limited due to the need to collect several thousand images to reconstruct a single super-resolution image. One solution to this problem is to greatly increase the density of photoactivated molecules in a given camera frame, but doing so requires more sophisticated computational methods to produce a satisfactory result. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to develop, improve, and utilize super-resolution microscopy with a focus on imaging live cells. In Aim 1 we will develop alternative illumination approaches for SIM using economical components, and we will develop and implement improved SIM reconstruction algorithms which produce higher quality, more reliable results than are available with current methods. In Aim 2, we will improve single molecule localization microscopy, by developing and implementing algorithms for analysis of images with high densities of photoactivated molecules. Using the high density single molecule methods we develop, we expect to be able to accelerate imaging speed by a factor of 50, with a resulting image resolution of approximately 20 nm. In Aim 3, we will use the newly developed methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses. We will use a novel total internal reflection-SIM microscope with polarized excitation to reveal the relationship between cell surface receptors and the morphology of the plasma membrane, in particular membrane regions with high curvature. NIH-R15: Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy Project Narrative Several methods are now available which are able to produce optical fluorescence microscopy images of cells with a resolution that is not limited by diffraction. These methods, known together as super-resolution microscopy, are limited in their capabilities and applications when imaging live cells. This interdisciplinary AREA project, submitted by a team of three investigators, will involve undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs in improving live cell imaging with super-resolution microscopy techniques. We will use the improved methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses, which affect more than 50 million Americans each year.",Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy,9515507,R15GM128166,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Award', 'Basophilic leukemia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Colorado', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'HELLS gene', 'IgE Receptors', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Lateral', 'Lighting', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nobel Prize', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Physics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'allergic response', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'graduate student', 'imaging detector', 'imaging modality', 'immunological synapse formation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'live cell imaging', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R15,2018,432000,0.144598178
"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.  The success of this project will improve the performance of modeling of transition-metal complexes and making the modelings possible for the systems that current algorithms fail.

"Multiscale Simulations on the Mechanism and Inhibition of the AAA Protein p97    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanocoupling of energy stored in triphosphate nucleosides provide the power necessary for many in vivo processes. One major class of enzymes, the AAA family, couples ATP hydrolysis to mechanical motions essential in a variety of cellular pathways including (but not limited to) protein degradation, organelle maintenance, replication and recombination. The protein p97 (also known as valosin-containing protein) is one of the most widely studied members of this family and has therefore become a representative member from which general principles of AAA proteins may be inferred. First discovered in 1990, p97 is highly abundant in the cell (composing nearly 1% of the cytosol), hexamerizes, and forms a stacked-ring shaped complex in solution. p97 is also believed to play a key role in the degradation pathway of IkBa, which results in the down-regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells and explains the observation of increased p97 presence in numerous cancer lines. Structurally, each monomer is composed of two hydrolysis domains (D1 and D2 with only D2 being catalytically active under standard cellular conditions), an N-terminal domain that interacts with effector proteins, a C-terminal domain, and linker regions between them. In this proposal we suggest computational experiments to expand our understanding of the structure and function of p97 in addition to developing small molecule inhibitors that target its active site. Initial in silico work will focus on the conformational structures and motions inherent to the major hydrolysis states through the use of long-times scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition, discrepancies between low and high resolution experimental structures will be addressed. In an attempt to discover small molecules that inhibit p97, virtual screening will then be performed against structures resulting from the MD simulations using docking methods in conjunction with the relaxed complex scheme. Top candidate molecules will then be experimentally tested by our collaborators and their results may then be used in guiding further screening calculations. Molecules identified as top inhibitors will then be refined through lead optimization, which will be assisted through the development of a novel lead optimization methodology. Finally, hydrolysis pathways will be analyzed through free energy calculations with combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics calculations to further our understanding of residues, water molecules, and ions in the active site. Results of simulations will advance our understanding of p97 structure and function on multiple time and length scales while also developing new small molecule inhibitors that target this highly important protein. Additionally, the lead optimization methods developed herein will allow for increased accuracy at a reduced cost in structure based drug design.   Results from simulations proposed here might potentially have a significant impact on public health through advancing our understanding of the structure, function, and hydrolysis mechanism of the highly abundant enzyme p97. The importance to various cellular pathways makes p97 an interesting chemotheraputic target, and one project described here aims to discover high-affinity inhibitors of this target (of which there are currently none) and could potentially lead to drug development targeting cancer cells. Additionally, the development of lead optimizations methods could result in improved  structure based drug design methods for a variety of enzyme targets.",Multiscale Simulations on the Mechanism and Inhibition of the AAA Protein p97,8071516,F32GM093581,"['ATP Hydrolysis', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding', 'C-terminal', 'Catalysis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Cytosol', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Design', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Free Energy', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hydrolysis', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleotides', 'Organelles', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'computer studies', 'cost', 'density', 'drug development', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'member', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'monomer', 'novel', 'nucleoside triphosphate', 'overexpression', 'p97 ATPase', 'professor', 'protein degradation', 'quantum', 'research study', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'theories', 'valosin-containing protein', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2011,36834,0.13683721
"Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing Project Summary Abstract Nymirum will utilize its technology platform to identify and optimize a drug-like, orally available small molecule that binds toxic CUG repeat RNAs to rescue myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) derived mis-splicing and treat the disease. DM1 is a rare genetic disorder that leads to progressive muscle degeneration, cardiovascular disease, severe cognitive disabilities, insulin resistance, and a host of other symptoms. There is no cure for DM1, and the only treatments are palliative. The cause of DM1 is an abnormal CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion (>34 repeats) in the 3′-UTR of DMPK that are transcribed into toxic CUG RNA repeats that accumulate in the nucleus of cells. Toxic CUG repeats sequester Muscleblind Like Splicing Regulator 1 (MBNL1), which is needed for normal splicing of hundreds of key neuromuscular related genes. Studies have shown that small molecules that bind CUG repeats can prevent MBNL1 sequestration and rescue nominal splicing in cells and animal models. However, these small molecules are bulky, very polar, and non-drug-like and therefore suffer from delivery and toxicity issues. Therefore the need remains to identify and optimize drug-like, orally available small molecules that bind CUG repeats and rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in cells. Preliminary data highlights that the Nymirum platform has identified two classes of drug-like small molecules that can bind CUG repeats and can rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in HeLa cells. This proposal seeks to go wider and deeper in order to identify and optimize more potent compounds. In Phase I, >2 billion compounds will be rapidly and accurately screened to identify additional classes of chemically diverse drug-like small molecule CUG binders. Those hits will then be optimized at the atomic level using the dynamic CUG structure to guide targeted medicinal chemistry to increase their potency and efficacy in HeLa cells. Phase II will carry out lead-generation in earnest on the hits identified in Phase I. Ultimately, this proposal will develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic to treat DM1. Project Narrative Nymirum is leveraging its platform to develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic that rescues myotonic dystrophy type 1 derived mis-splicing by binding toxic CUG RNA repeats and preventing them from sequestering a key splicing regulator (MBNL1).",Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing,10135372,R43NS117184,"['Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animal Model', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioavailable', 'Biological Assay', 'CUG repeat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Hela Cells', 'Inherited', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Retardation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Myotonic dystrophy type 1', 'Oral', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Visual impairment', 'cognitive disability', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'interest', 'muscle degeneration', 'neuromuscular', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rare genetic disorder', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'success', 'targeted nucleases', 'three dimensional structure', 'virtual']",NINDS,"NYMIRUM, INC.",R43,2020,299267,0.126817012
"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.123973474
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"Molecular Diagnostics using a Nanopore to Analyze Secretions from Single Cells Project Summary  The proteins secreted from a cell constitute a complex subset of molecules referred to as the secretome. They are key factors mediating cell-cell communication. So, eavesdropping on the secretome informs molecular diagnostics, drug discovery and tissue engineering. The challenge then is to detect the proteins as they are secreted only in minute amounts, and diluted and/or contaminated in culture. Moreover, since tissue is heterogeneous, it is necessary to detect secretions from single cells, which is confounded by bulk-culture analysis. So, sensitivity is paramount.  In response to the Focus Technology Research and Development solicitation, this proposal furnishes a plan to develop a tool that uses a nanopore to interrogate the secretome of single cells with extreme, single molecule sensitivity and high throughput. The blockades that develop in the ionic current through a nanopore, when a secreted, charged molecule is impelled through it by an electric field, measure the molecular volumes occluding the pore. A catalog of the blockades can be used to discriminate between different cellular phenotypes non-destructively, quickly, in real-time, and to interrogate the secretome for specific biomarkers. AIM #1: Single cell secretomics. As it reflects the different molecular constituencies comprising the secretome, the blockade current distributions should reveal distinctive aspects unique to the cell-type. To prove out this hypothesis, three categories of cells will be scrutinized: breast cancer cells; human induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives; and mouse embryonic stem cells and their derivatives. Single cells will be positioned with optical tweezers over a pore embedded in a microfluidic device and the resulting blockades will be classified by the Cramér’s distance, , and the expression of specific biomarkers will be tracked in real-time. AIM #2: Discriminant analysis of the single cell secretomes. To improve on  for discriminating cell-types, a Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM) will be implemented that captures the profile of proteins in a secretome. This model will be fitted to the data with the number of components determined by a Bayesian Information Criterion and classifier will be developed to discriminate cell-types in real-time. The GMM will infer which proteins are up-/down-regulated in a cell, compared to the control, in an unbiased way. AIM #3: Micro/Nanofluidic integrated circuits for improved throughput. To boost throughput, arrays of eight nanopores will be fabricated and tested for concurrent single cell analysis. These arrays will be embedded in a microfluidic device incorporating integrated pneumatic valves to be used to convey cells to each pore, and each pore will be independently addressed by integrated electrodes for detecting blockades and producing di-electrophoretic forces for positioning the cell (instead of optical tweezers). To slash the down- time required to purge the microfluidic between measurements, fouling-resistant surfaces that relieve non- specific binding of protein and prevent cell adhesion to either glass and/or PDMS microfluidics will be tested.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health.

Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,0.109477253
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening.

"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases. Specifically, we pursue questions of how a cell line responds to a single drug and combinatorial therapies, from the perspective of biological networks and small-molecule chemoinformatics. One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases. Our research program will contribute to accelerate the drug discovery process by in silico screening through large amount of potent chemicals.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases).

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense.

This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This supplement to the original RO1 is to purchase a small GPU cluster to enable rapid prototyping of many of the approaches that are proposed in this project outlined in the four aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications.

"New conserved candidate for egg activation and early embryogenesis in Drosophila.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transition from egg to embryo is a critical time in development. Since this process is essential for fertility, a better understanding of its mechanisms is important in developmental biology and will also help to optimize ART procedures. It has thus far been very difficult to identify the critical proteins needed for this transition, in part because it is too rapid to involve changes in gene transcription. Instead, numerous lines of evidence argue that this rapid and comprehensive change in cell state is mostly accomplished by post-translational modification of existing proteins. We are focusing on proteins whose phosphorylation state is modulated during egg activation, reasoning that these proteins constitute an enriched pool of molecules important for the egg-to-embryo transition. We propose to use germline-specific RNAi to screen among 258 conserved proteins that our proteomics screens have found to be phospho-modulated during egg activation in Drosophila. By straightforward phenotypic screening that takes advantage of the latest strains and methods for this model organism, we expect to identify the genes that regulate the transition from a mature oocyte to an ""activated"" egg that can begin development, as well as those genes that initiate its embryogenesis. We will prioritize the order of screening, giving precedence to genes likely to encode upstream regulators of this transition, and to one class of downstream effectors: those likely to regulate the cell cycle as it transitions from meiosis to mitosis. Once we have identified these new players, we will use Western blotting and phosph-proteomics to begin to order their actions. The goal of the proposed research is to discover the critical genes that carry out the important developmental transition from egg to embryo. These genes will permit future studies to dissect in detail the molecular interactions and pathways that carry out egg activation and initiate embryogenesis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To understand fertility, as well as to design optimal methods for infertility treatments such as IVF and ICSI, we need to know the molecules that ""activate"" an egg to develop immediately after fertilization. Few of these molecules are known because of technical difficulties in previous methods to identify proteins that act during this narrow window of time. Taking a new approach, we propose to identify such molecules by screening genetically among a defined set of proteins chosen because their chemical modification state changes when eggs are triggered to activate development in the genetic model system, Drosophila.                ",New conserved candidate for egg activation and early embryogenesis in Drosophila.,8701322,R21HD072714,"['Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Infertility', 'Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injections', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Oocytes', 'Oogenesis', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Poly(A)+ RNA', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Dephosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'egg', 'embryonic protein', 'fly', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'text searching', 'tool']",NICHD,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,187305,0.07626267

It will also be used to compute the ionic conductance through a protein which forms a small ion channel as the amino acid sequence of the protein is changed by site-directed mutagenesis.  The second major project is the development of a computing system for a SUN 160/3 with image processing boards for automatic extraction of cell and fiber outlines from serial section micrographs.

As new hardware becomes available in the second year of the proposed grant, we expect to convert the manual CARTOS system on the LOANER, so that it can carry out automatic nerve tracing and be available to outside users.  n/a",COMPUTER RESOURCE--MOLECULAR MECHANICS AND NEURO-ANATOMY,3103639,P41RR000442,"['artificial intelligence', ' biological models', ' chemical models', ' chemical structure function', ' computer center', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computers', ' conformation', ' crystallization', ' image processing', ' intercellular connection', ' macromolecule', ' membrane channels', ' molecular biology', ' molecular energy level', ' neuroanatomy', ' protein engineering', ' protein structure', ' synapses']",NCRR,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,P41,1988,679860,0.070288637
"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems.

"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,0.059647767
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design A fundamental challenge to translate insights between biomedical researchers, who study biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns, cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization. Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on disease states. In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them; (b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature. We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs, implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources. From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease? To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity, such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing), but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function and disease pathophysiology. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9540181,OT3TR002025,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Probability', 'Processed Genes', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Terminology', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical genetics', 'data integration', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'protein function', 'response', 'small molecule', 'treatment effect']",NCATS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",OT3,2017,651119,0.034603767

"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects.

"In Silico Assesment of Drug Metabolism and Toxicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Failure of molecules in the late stages of drug development are to a large extent attributable to poor ADME/Tox properties. These properties are generally predictable in the earlier, cheaper stages of drug discovery. The goal of this work is to predict metabolism and toxicity using a computational suite called MetaDrug. This integrates human endogenous and xenobiotic metabolic as well as signalling pathways and can also incorporate gene expression, and experimental data. Under phase I, novel algorithms for predicting major CYP-mediated pathways were generated and successfully validated along with rules for predicting metabolites and reactive metabolites formed which are likely to be toxic. This algorithm development enabled the prediction of substrates and metabolites, the affinity and the rate of metabolism as well as interactions with other endogenous, metabolic and signalling pathways. With phase II funding we will develop large comprehensive datasets (>1000 molecules) for in vitro drug-drug interactions with the major CYPs, and use these for generating machine learning algorithms for these human drug metabolizing enzymes. We will also annotate rat and mouse data for drug metabolism and the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes, capturing the kinetic data which can also be used for predictive model building. We will also generate a novel algorithm for the accurate prediction of metabolites using the metabolite rules from phase I to produce a molecular fingerprint for known drugs. The database of molecules with known human metabolites will then be used as an input for a machine learning algorithm. We will combine the predictions from our various QSAR models for enzyme affinity and rate of metabolism, the relative contributions of these enzymes and their tissue distribution, to ultimately predict the clearance of a drug. The proposed work will enable GeneGo to develop a unique tool that will improve the prediction of metabolism and toxicity. These new features and database content will then be marketed to pharmaceutical companies and academia. n/a",In Silico Assesment of Drug Metabolism and Toxicity,6990722,R44GM069124,[' '],NIGMS,"GENEGO, INC.",R44,2005,417880,0.033174429
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. We will first apply this representation to build more powerful computational models that can more accurately predict properties such as bioactivity, ADME/ Tox, and pharmacokinetics across libraries of molecular structures. The ultimate goal is to leverage this repre- sentation to generate novel compounds with better combinations of properties. Both of these capabilities will help scientists to accelerate discovery of new drugs broadly across many therapeutic areas.  Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Some properties (e.g. logP) can now be modeled with such high confidence that the models have replaced the need to perform the assays, but many other critical properties (e.g. solubility, ADME, PK, hERG) remain far from this goal. We expect that our proposed chemically rich vectors will significantly advance the state of the art beyond what can be achieved with conventional descriptors and fingerprints. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  Our central innovation is a novel computational strategy: first develop a deep learning (DL) model optimized to best capture the essential structural and chemical features of molecules, starting from the most natural structural representation; then validate the DL model by applying it to improve QSAR modeling of pharmacological properties; and finally extend it to generate previously unknown molecules that have superior properties – the so-called “inverse QSAR” problem, which is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry. Others have unsuccessfully tried to leap directly to solve the inverse QSAR problem. We propose a more patient and methodical approach that will allow the neural network to perform self-supervised training to learn about chemical structures and properties from readily available, extremely large datasets, then transfer this learning to improve modeling; only after establishing this solid foundation do we intend to apply the models to attempt inverse QSAR. Prior attempts in this area have also relied on neural network architectures designed originally for language processing. We will design a new architecture, more akin to neural network architectures that have proven most successful at image classification, and optimize it to directly process the “molecular graph” that represents the relationship of atoms and bonds in molecules. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,9612249,R43TR002527,"['Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Solubility', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'molecular vector', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149830,0.031365675
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.

"2D NMR SPECTRA, IMAG. RECONSTRUCTION AND PATTERN RECOG. The long term objectives of this project are:  (1) to develop an entirely new computer software approach for making unambiguous spectral assignments in 2-dimensional FT NMR of small to middle-sized proteins and other biomolecules, and (2) to use the same software approach for enhancement of MR images and for automated feature recognition.  These two apparently different project areas are actually closely related technically, as the combined multivariate analysis/logic programming approach to be used is essentially identical (with different rules).  The two project goals each have important biomedical ramifications:  (1) Recognition and isolation of each spin system in a complex 2D NMR spectrum from a small potein will greatly enhance structure studies of these molecules; (2) Application to MRI will improve quality of these experiments, obviate some of many experimental difficulties, and significantly enhance image interpretation where ambiguities are present.  This project has an excellent chance to give rise to a family of software products of major commercial importance in both the biomedical and chemical marketplaces.  n/a","2D NMR SPECTRA, IMAG.
