"DNA Polymerase Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project concerns the design, construction and publication of a comprehensive database on DNA polymerases - DNAPolBase. DNAPolBase will serve as a freely available, high quality resource of DNA polymerase biochemistry, biology, genetics and structure. The worksite for this project will be New England Biolabs, in Ipswich, MA. The corruption of DNA copying is responsible for virtually all genetic disease states and the core machines responsible for this copying process are DNA polymerases. DNA polymerases are also key elements in a variety of diagnostic and molecular biology applications including DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase-based applications frequently involve non-natural substrates and reaction conditions, and engineered enzymes well suited to these applications are increasingly sought. The identification of novel polymerases and entire new super families has spurred renewed interest in these enzymes. This abundance of information makes it increasingly difficult for casual and experienced researchers alike to maintain a comprehensive view of the field. Despite their importance, no single repository for information relevant to the study and use of DNA polymerases currently exists. We will compile the wealth of known polymerase data from public and private records into a searchable database to provide a useful first step in understanding the role of these enzymes in vivo, and to inform their use in and adaptation to numerous applications. As part of the groundwork of database development, key collaborations with scientists willing to seed this database with their own libraries of private and public polymerase data and records have begun. From this auspicious start a database will be organized to serve the informational needs of numerous user groups, including basic and pharmaceutical researchers, application based scientists, instructors, and students. Functions from large-scale comparative studies (desired to advance many aspects of polymerase-based research and applications) to simple queries of polymerase properties or origins will be provided. We anticipate that NEB will benefit in much the same way that the public will by having access to such a resource, namely by advancing our internal DNA polymerase development projects.

"Molecular mechanisms of germline DNA repair and DNA damage response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Failure to activate the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway allows cells with unrepaired DNA to divide and can lead to the formation and proliferation of tumors. Impaired DNA repair can increase the incidence of cancer through the formation of deletions, amplifications, and gross chromosomal rearrangements. A hallmark feature of tumor progression is aneuploidy as a result of aberrant chromosome segregation stemming from impaired DNA damage checkpoint activation and/or DNA repair. Importantly, defects in germline DNA repair and DNA damage response also lead to aneuploidy, and as a result, to miscarriages, birth defects, infertility and tumorigenesis. Despite the relevance of both DDR and DNA repair for human health, these mechanisms are not fully understood at the molecular level. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in maintaining genomic stability at the molecular level in the nematode C. elegans, an ideal model system for germline studies, amenable to molecular, genetic, biochemical, cytological and computational biology approaches. We have recently identified HIM-20, an uncharacterized D111/Gpatch domain containing protein also present in humans. Partial depletion of HIM-20 results in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and a delay in the repair of meiotic double strand breaks. HIM-20 colocalizes and interacts with crossover promoting proteins. We propose that HIM-20 is involved in DNA repair and acts to promote crossover formation. We will determine the mechanism of function of HIM-20 in DNA repair by examining both the progression and output of recombination in him-20 mutants; the response of him-20 mutants to DNA damage; the interdependencies driving the localization pattern of HIM-20; identifying its binding partners; and determining its DNA substrate binding specificities in vitro. These studies will provide critical insight into the procss by which HIM-20 and its human ortholog promote genome stability. Through combined genetic, molecular, cytological and biochemical approaches, we will determine the mechanism of function for ZTF-8, a novel and conserved protein that our studies have shown interacts with a component of the 9-1-1 DDR complex and is required for DDR and DSB repair. These studies will shed new light on our understanding of the DDR and DSB repair pathways in the germline. Finally, we will identify the genetic interaction network required for proper chromosome segregation and apoptosis in the nematode C. elegans. We will test pair-wise combinations of genetic mutations in DNA repair and DDR genes with depletion of germline-enriched genes by RNAi in a high-throughput format designed and proven to detect chromosome missegregation and cells undergoing apoptosis. Hierarchical clustering of genetic interaction profiles associated with each query will order genes to identify those that are functionally related, predict biochemical pathways and protein complexes, assign function to uncharacterized genes, and reveal the large-scale structure of the biological network driving genome stability. Taken together, this application will provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating genome stability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative ! Defects in germline DNA repair and DNA damage response lead to miscarriages, birth defects, infertility and tumor formation. This application takes advantage of the ease of genetic, cytological, molecular, biochemical and computational biology analysis in the worm C. elegans to investigate the molecular mechanisms of function for DNA repair and DNA damage response proteins also present in humans.

"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,0.221882768
"Comprehensive breakpoint analyses for simultaneous quantification of all DNA double strand break repair pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: DNA double strand(DSB) breaks are repaired through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), microhomology- mediated end-joining (MMEJ), or homologous recombination (HR). These pathways are of central importance in the carcinogenesis of HR deficient cancers and in the response to DNA damaging agents. However, the pathways remain challenging to measure directly apart from using specialized cell lines with stably integrated DNA repair reporter cassettes or by indirectly measuring repair through visualization of pathway factors within irradiation induced foci. We have developed a simple system to measure the usage of all three pathways at a single genomic location using Cas9 to create double strand breaks and next generation sequencing to profile and quantify pathway choice in a pool of cells (DSBR-seq). Principal component analyses using experiments in isogenic cell lines deficient in each pathway are used to classify MMEJ genomic scars separately from NHEJ scars. The system can be used in any live cell to which Cas9 can be delivered, obviating the need for reporter cell lines. We have demonstrated that almost all pathway-specific information can be reduced to just a few dominant types of scars that are characteristic to a genomic locus. Thus, the selected dominant reads can be probed with droplet digital PCR (DSBR-ddPCR). The overall objective of this proposal is to further develop this approach for wide usage in basic DSB repair research. There are also important downstream applications in translational science, such as detection of HR deficient cancers and use in DNA repair inhibitor clinical trials. The central hypothesis is that these approaches can replace reporter cassettes as the preferred method to measure DSB repair and allow for measurement of diverse types of genomic scars. In Aim 1, we will maximize applicability of DSBR-seq through advanced development in human and murine cells and validate the approach through comparisons to reporter cassettes using positive and negative controls that perturb each pathway. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate a simpler readout of pathway capacity through DSBR-ddPCR, which can be broadly used in research laboratories without the need for next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. Our quantitative milestones are designed to compare DSBR-seq/DSBR-ddPCR directly against cassette reporter assays. These proposed aims would provide a significant contribution due to the potentially broad applicability of the technologies in basic and preclinical research as the study of DSB repair constitutes a large swath of NCI-sponsored research activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Commonly used cancer treatments create DNA double strand breaks, which a cell must repair using three primary DNA repair pathways in order to survive. Thus, understanding the relative usage and mechanisms of action of these three repair pathways is of paramount importance to public health in oncology.

"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments.

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR RECOMBINANT DNA INVENTION DISCLOSURE The information produced by the Human Genome Project and related research is expected to revolutionize biology and medicine in general and recombinant DNA technology in particular.  At present, however, obtaining patent protection for inventions involving recombinant DNA technology is an acknowledged bottleneck in the development of the U.S. biotechnology industry.  While much attention has been focused on the problems that occur during prosecution of patent applications, little has been focused on the quality of those applications.  This research will assess the technical feasibility of developing a knowledge-based expert system for facilitating the authoring of recombinant DNA invention disclosures.  The purpose of the software is to improve the quality of international and U.S. patent applications for the purpose of reducing the duration of their pendency and associated uncertainty regarding the scope of their claims. International and U.S. invention disclosure requirements will be reviewed to provide a basis for development of a software requirements specification.  object-oriented programming techniques will then be used to prepare high- and low-level software design documentation.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women.

"Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish novel genomics and bioinformatics approaches to model patterns of DNA replication in cells. It is known that the patterns of DNA replication are intimately linked to the cell type. These differences between cell types are relevant to the integrity of the genome during cell type transitions. For example, we recently found that damage during DNA replication is increased during the induced transition from one cell type to another. However, there is a lack of methodology to observe replication patterns in human cells. DNA replication differs between different cell types in the location of initiation, the direction of fork progression, and the timing of initiation and completion. There is currently no method that can comprehensively map the progression of DNA replication to the genome. Because of the importance of DNA replication in cell proliferation, there is need for the development of such methods. To be able to examine the progression of DNA polymerases in human cells, we will develop a novel methodology to map DNA replication genome-wide, by incorporating nucleotide analogs during DNA replication, and sequencing the resulting DNA molecules by Nanopore sequencing and recording the electrical signals. In parallel, we will develop novel bioinformatics approaches to reliably examine the electrical signals and identify bases or regions of DNA replication, for comparison between different cell types, or between healthy and diseased tissues. Successful establishment of this technology will greatly increase our knowledge of replication, genetic stability and cell proliferation, and allow the community to characterize differences in the progression of DNA replication between cell types.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.

"INTEGRATED SOLID-STATE/SOLUTION NMR STUDY OF DNA It is proposed to use a combination of solid-state and solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure and dynamics of DNA and of drugs and other agents bound to DNA.  It has recently been shown that the methods for determining the conformation of the deoxyribose ring in DNA oligomers may be susceptible to errors arising from quantum-mechanical interference between dipolar cross-relaxation and the J coupling.  This J coupling is used, via the Karplus equation, to determine the conformation.  A new mathematical formalism is proposed to allow calculation of these interference effects.  A series of experiments is proposed to evaluate the seriousness of the errors resulting from a neglect of this term; methods for correct extraction of J couplings and cross-relaxation rate constants will be developed.

It has recently been shown that the methods for determining the conformation of the deoxyribose ring in DNA oligomers may be susceptible to errors arising from quantum-mechanical interference between dipolar cross-relaxation and the J coupling.  This J coupling is used, via the Karplus equation, to determine the conformation.  A new mathematical formalism is proposed to allow calculation of these interference effects.  A series of experiments is proposed to evaluate the seriousness of the errors resulting from a neglect of this term; methods for correct extraction of J couplings and cross-relaxation rate constants will be developed.  Solid-state NMR experiments on DNA fibers and model compounds, which originally gave the discrepant results which pointed out the existence of this interference term, will be continued, with an emphasis on observing drug binding to synthetic DNA high polymers of high molecular weight.  n/a",INTEGRATED SOLID-STATE/SOLUTION NMR STUDY OF DNA,3295901,R01GM039071,"['DNA', ' RNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' conformation', ' dipole moment', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' nonwater solvent', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', ' nucleic acid chemical synthesis', ' nucleic acid structure', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' solid state', ' solutions']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R01,1993,129494,0.186423033
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We will use a combination of computer programming and biochemistry to study some interesting questions in molecular biology.  Our nucleic-acid sequence library system will be improved to allow the user the powers of recombinant DNA technology available to the biochemist.  All of our software will be extensively modularized to facilitate program development and transportation, both of which will hasten improvements.  We will continue to expand our collection of programs to analyze sequence-function relationships.  This will include improvements to our program of a pattern recognition algorithm (the ""perceptron"") and adaptations of multiple regression analyses to nucleic-acid sequence problems.  These techniques will be used to make quantitative models for sequence effects on promoter efficiency and mutagenicity.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,0.147733886

"NEW WORD BASED METHODS FOR DNA SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY The growing use of DNA sequence data in research, databases, diagnostic          and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation dramatically                  increases the need to improve the quality of data being used.  This              proposal addresses the problem of assembling a large set of sequenced            DNA fragments into a finished consensus. In order for a sequencing               project to produce high quality finished sequence data, the assembly of          sequence fragments must be correct and accurate both in its large scale          structure and in the fine scale detail of the alignment of individual            base calls. We propose to investigate new algorithms for consensus               estimation and assembly of DNA sequence fragments.  Recent novel word-           based approaches to consensus estimation offer promise as a method for           de novo assembly and for exploring alternative assemblies on the large           scale.  This will be especially important when sequences contain large           exact or approximate repeats.  We propose to develop several main                enhancements to these algorithms.  In particular, we will develop a              global optimization algorithm for determining consensus sequences,               replacing current locally optimizing methods.  Also, we propose to               develop algorithms allowing alternative alignments in regions of                 ambiguity.  This approach will allow us to assess alignment accuracy at          both the large and fine scale level.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses.

The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology.

"Mechanisms of DNA Polymerases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  DNA polymerases are essential for maintaining genomic order during DNA replication and repair and thus for the long-term survival of a species. When DNA damage arising from a variety of exogenous and endogenous sources (e.g. environmental chemicals and radiation, smoking, thermal aberrations) is not accurately repaired, it can lead to human diseases like colon, lung, or skin cancer and premature aging. Thus, understanding polymerase fidelity mechanisms in DNA synthesis represents a fundamental biological and biomedical challenge. The fidelity of DNA polymerases broadly refers to their ability to incorporate correct rather than incorrect nucleotides complementary to the template DNA; such fidelities span a wide range, from 1 to nearly 10(E6) errors per one million nucleotides incorporated. Based on extensive structural and kinetic data as well as theoretical studies for several DNA polymerases, we hypothesize that high fidelity enzymes tightly orchestrate the assembly of the active site prior to nucleotide incorporation, while lower fidelity polymerases have a more flexible active site and thus a distinct assembly process; characteristic differences in the electrostatic environment and plasticity of the binding pocket likely result. Since static crystallographic structures and kinetic experimental studies of DNA polymerases cannot describe complete dynamic and energetic effects of the active site, dynamics simulations are well poised, and critically needed, to complement polymerase experimental results. In our collaborative project between an experimental and theoretical team, we will investigate systematically at atomic resolution how the conformational changes and nucleotide incorporation (chemical) pathways for higher-fidelity (pol beta) and low-fidelity (Dpo4) polymerases dictate different steering mechanisms, and how the template base, incoming nucleotide, key protein residues, and lesion-modified DNA affect the binding pocket electrostatic environment/plasticity and thus fidelity. These aims will be achieved by a combination of long-time molecular dynamics simulations and novel methodologies (transition path sampling, stochastic path approach, principal component analysis, and mixed quantum-classical mechanics methods) and an iterative design between theory and experimentation for testing, validating, and expanding these hypotheses. In particular, by delineating complete reaction profiles (conformational change and chemistry) for correct and incorrect basepairs in pol beta and relating them to experimentally-determined catalytic efficiencies and fidelity values, we will propose the rate-limiting step, orchestration of the active site assembly, and fidelity mechanisms involved and subsequently test them by experiments on mutant systems. Moreover, we will test our hypothesis that subtle conformational changes in Dpo4's thumb and little finger domains are closely associated with Dpo4's low-fidelity and lesion bypassing mechanisms, which are likely distinct than pol beta's. Our long term goals are to bridge macroscopic polymerase structures and kinetic measurements regarding catalytic efficiency, fidelity, and nucleotide binding affinity to better understand fidelity mechanisms of DNA polymerases, including response to oxidative damage and other lesions.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers.

"BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Geospiza Inc. and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are creating a standards based software framework around NCSA's Heirarchical Data Format (HDF5). The envisioned framework will integrate algorithms important in DNA and protein sequence analysis to create scalable high throughput software systems which will be accessed using new graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide researchers with new views of their data to finish sequencing projects in large-scale genome sequencing, microbial genome sequencing, viral epidemiology, polymorphism detection, phylogenetic analysis, multi-locus sequence typing, confirmatory sequencing, and EST analysis.    In our vision, algorithms will be either integrated into the system to directly read and write from HDF5 project files, or they will communicate with project files via filter programs that produce standardized XML formatted data. Through this model, a scalable solution will support different applications of DNA sequencing, fulfilling the many needs and requirements expressed by the medical research community now and into the future. As the first step in this process we will, define requirements for editing and versioning data in DNA sequencing, research and propose data models for the computational phases of DNA sequencing and annotating DNA sequence data using existing standards, create a prototype application for DNA sequencing based SNP discovery, and engage the bioinformatics community for BioHDF adoption.       In the past ten years the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped over 1000 fold and the amount of raw sequence data, entering our national repositories is doubling every 12 months. DNA sequencing is fundamental to biological research activities such as genomics, systems biology, and clinical medicine. Proposals are being sought to decrease sequencing costs by two orders of magnitude through technology refinements with an ultimate vision of developing technology to sequence human genome equivalents for $1000 each. The amount of data that will be produced through these endeavors is unimaginable. However, the $1,000 genome will not advance medical research unless we integrate all phases of the DNA sequencing process and treat the creation, management, finishing, analysis, and sharing of the data as common goals. n/a",BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics,6992995,R41HG003792,"['DNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic mapping', 'genetic polymorphism', 'mathematics', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'virus genetics']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R41,2005,142775,0.141346888
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9483343,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypercellular Bone Marrow', 'Hypermethylation', 'ITGB3 gene', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,389800,0.138389539

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.            ",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,8979977,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypermethylation', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'methylation biomarker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,404125,0.138389539
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9999533,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision drugs', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,525099,0.135398306

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing.

"Genomics: Esophageal Metaplasia-Associated Malignancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Barrett's esophagus is a highly premalignant disease of unknown prevalence, but it predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is increasing at alarming rates in Western countries. The molecular genetics of esophageal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus, has been studied intensively in recent years. However, a better knowledge of the molecular alterations occurring in this setting will yield several benefits. Firstly, the discovery of novel molecular alterations will yield clues to biological pathways underlying Barrett's-associated neoplastic transformation, and these clues may lead to better in vitro and in vivo models of this disease. Secondly, molecular alterations themselves can be used as markers of early detection, disease progression, or ultimate prognosis in patients with Barrett's or cancer. Thirdly, these molecular alterations can be pursued as possible therapeutic targets for intervention, in both the prevention and treatment of this disease. The Aims of the current proposal will be to discover novel molecular alterations in Barrett's metaplasia and neoplasia, and to concentrate on the second of these benefits, i.e., to perform translational research to determine the potential value of these alterations as markers of disease progression. By using the same cDNA microarray platform to determine changes in DNA copy number, methylation status, and gene expression level, we will facilitate the translation of molecular genetic data from the genomic, to the epigenetic, to the transcriptomic, and finally to the protein (biomarker) level. This final level will employ tissue microarrays to test and validate specific candidate genes derived from the first three levels of study. These goals will be implemented by pursuing the following Aims:      Aim 1. To perform global exploration for changes in DNA copy number in the Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence (Barrett's neoplasia), using cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (microarray-CGH). a) Global patterns of DNA amplification and deletion will be identified by microarray-CGH and characterized at each stage of Barrett's neoplasia, using hierarchical clustering, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), and artificial neural networks, b) Specific cDNAs showing the most consistent and/or marked alterations in DNA copy number will be identified, characterized and validated using quantitative real-time PCR, for further study in Aim 4.      Aim 2. To perform global epigenetic profiling at various stages in Barrett's neoplasia, using methylation-specific oligonucleotide microarrays. The genome will be screened for novel targets of DNA hypermethylation in various stages of Barrett's neoplasia, using methylation-specific oligonucleotide microarrays.      Aim 3.  To Using ANNs, to perform analyses of global gene expression data in Barrett's neoplasia. Results of genomic studies in Aims 1 and 2 will be correlated with global expression data in order to identify the genes most significantly different at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels at each stage of Barrett's neoplasia, for further study in Aim 4.       Aim 4.

"THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF DNA SUPERHELICAL EQUILIBRIA This research program will develop accurate theoretical methods for  analyzing secondary structural equilibria in superhelical DNA molecules  of kilobase length and specified sequence, in which all transitions  compete to which the sequence is susceptible.  These include B-Z  transitions, cruciform extrusions, B-H transitions, and strand  separation.  Methods also will be developed for handling local sequence  effects, known to occur in practice, that complicate the energetics of  transitions and the calculation of equilibria.  Examples include chemical  adducts, abasic sites or other disruptions of base pairing, and imperfect  susceptible sequences such as imprecise inverted repeat symmetry or  purine-pyrimidine alternation.  Methods based on Monte Carlo techniques  will be developed for the analysis of superhelical secondary structural  transitions at high temperatures or in extremely long DNA sequences  (approximately 105 base pairs).  Monte Carlo methods also will be  developed to analyze the interplay between transitions and bending  deformations in superhelical  DNA molecules.  Transition state theories  of the kinetics of superhelical transconformation reactions will be  developed and tested against available data.  Collaborations with several  experimental groups will illuminate roles that superhelical DNA  conformational transitions play in normal and pathological processes.  These include projects examining:  1) the role of superhelical strand  separation in the initiation of replication; 2) mechanisms by which  superhelicity enhances DNA sensitivity to single strand breakage by x-  rays, and; 3) superhelical cruciform formation at orthopoxviral telomere  sequences and its role in replication.

"GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION IN AEDES ALBOPICIUS SUBGROUP Aedes albopictus in an important vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fevers.  From its presumed origin in southeast Asia, it has expanded its range from Madagascar to Hawaii.  It was introduced into the continental United States last year and rapidly colonized 12 states posing a serious public health threat.

The specific aims of the proposed project are to evaluate the vector competence for dengue fever of geographic strains of Aedes albopictus from the U.S. and abroad, determine the origin of U.S.  populations and monitor changes in their breeding structure over time, and characterize genetic variation among populations of Aedes albopictus from throughout its range and between five species in the Aedes albopictus subgroup.  The vector competence will be evaluated by cataloging variation in susceptibility to oral infection, disseminated infection and transmission among various strains, determining the degree to which these factors are under genetic control (their heritability), and if the heritability is found to be high, selecting for dengue refractory and susceptible strains of Ae. albopictus in order to determine the genetic basis of vector competency.

"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,9873543,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,504604,0.131862672
"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c.

"TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEQUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES The objective of this proposal is to significantly improve automated determination of DNA sequences.  Practical performance limits of automated DNA sequencers are determined by the separation of oligonucleotides effected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  Designs of contemporary instruments are basically similar.  As oligomers in a DNA sequencing ladder pass the detector(s), multi-component analysis specifies the radioactive or fluorescent label associated with each oligomer.  Under ideal conditions, determination of the sequence of terminal nucleotides is straightforward.  When separations of oligomers or signal levels are not optimal, ambiguities or errors are likely.  These are miscalled bases, extra or missing bases, or unidentified bases in the DNA sequence file, typically at about 1 to 3 errors per 100 bases.  An error rate near 1% is a common target for DNA sequencing performance, since comparison with complementary strand sequence data should then reduce errors to about 1 per 10,000 base pairs.  This is only possible if every mismatch of the sequence and its complement is identified and correctly reconciled.  Even then, error rates from 0.01% to 0.1% approximate the variation among alleles in a gene pool: some such alleles can correlate with severe burdens of inherited pathology.  Small improvements in single strand error rate will have substantial impact on quality of finished sequences from 1/10,000 bp to 1/1,000,000 bp. Improvements are needed if automated systems are to provide longer spans of DNA sequences with fewer errors.  The emphasis of this proposal is on raw data acquisition and new methods for translation of the raw data to finished DNA sequences.  An expert system, rule-based method will be developed to reinforce conventional translation of raw data to DNA sequences.  An independent, pattern-recognition system will also be developed and tested, using techniques for construction and training of neural nets.  We will also evaluate two new approaches to utilize single label, single data channels for more efficient determination of DNA sequences.  Alternative approaches to oligonucleotide separation for sequence analysis will also be investigated.

Alternative approaches to oligonucleotide separation for sequence analysis will also be investigated.  In pursuit of these specific aims we will take advantage of the relative separations and intensities of successive oligomers in DNA sequencing ladders, as independent determinants of DNA sequence-specific data stream patterns.  n/a",TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEQUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES,3333739,R01HG000562,"['DNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' genome', ' human genetic material tag', ' image processing', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,1992,272116,0.12946917
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape.

"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome. !",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10267380,R56HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Ploidies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Thymine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule real time sequencing']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R56,2020,233456,0.118716496
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs.

"Cell line identification with DNA replication timing fingerprints Project Summary Cultured cell lines have been widely used for basic research to study cell function, as models for disease, and for drug screening. Correct identification of the cell lines used is necessary to make the right scientific conclusions and replicate experiments. Cell lines in culture can be contaminated by foreign cells, which may rapidly displace the original cells. The routine verification of the identity of cultured cells should be performed, but a majority of laboratories do not monitor the identity of their cell lines, and many cell lines are misidentified. Analyses of cells submitted to major repositories such as the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) and the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) have found that 15-40% of cell lines submitted by investigators are misidentified. The costs, effort, and time required to confirm the identity of cell lines have been a barrier to adoption of cell line identification as a routine quality control measure. Current technologies for identifying cultured cells are limited, and their cost is a barrier for small scale use. In this SBIR phase I application, we aim to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing (RT) fingerprints, which are RT values at specific genomic regions. In our previous studies, we have discovered that DNA RT was highly specific to different cell lines and cell types and this specificity can be exploited for the purpose of cell line/type identification (PLoS Comp Biol, 2011; Genome Research, 2010; Genome Research 2015). A patent for RT fingerprint identification and use has been issued in 2016. Recently, we have applied this technology to identify common markers between distinct progeroid diseases (PNAS, 2017). A novel segmentation method, called iSeg, for segmenting genomic and epigenomic data has also been developed in our lab (BMC Bioinformatics, In Press), which can be used to further improve the identification of RT fingerprints. We propose to collect a large number of DNA RT profiles for a diverse set of cell lines and cell types and develop RT fingerprints for their identification. A web server will be built to take users’ input of RT data and output the cell line best matched with the input data. The web server can also take data of new cell lines from users to allow continually developing our models and database. RT fingerprints can be measured cost-effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment. Since the total cost for obtaining RT fingerprint for one sample is around $100, which can be further reduced when scaled up, our method makes it possible to routinely check the identity of cultured cells. Project narrative This SBIR phase I application aims to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing fingerprints, which can be measured cost- effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment.

"Identification of Biological Materials of Unknown Origin The applicant's long term goal is to understand and elucidate structure and organization within DNA sequences and uncover their relationship to biological functions. The objective of this application, which is a step toward the attainment of this long term goal, is to develop techniques for elucidating occult structural features in bacterial DNA which can be used for identification and differentiation of microbial organisms, including organisms whose genome has not been completely sequenced, using short fragments of DNA. A parallel goal is to achieve investigative independence as a computational biologist. The latter goal will be accomplished through coursework and training in the laboratories of Dr. S. Hinrichs, M.D. The urgent need for rapid identification tests for biological materials has intensified because of the threat posed by bio- terrorism. Rapid identification of both the fact and the mode of attack is essential for timely therapeutic intervention. The ability to identify bacteria based on short sequences of incomplete or possibly corrupt sequences allows for hazard detection, automation, and low cost distributed sensing capability. The identification techniques will be developed using three tools; the average mutual information (AMI) profile which reflects statistical relationships between bases along the DNA sequence, a cluster analysis technique developed by the applicant and co-workers which identifies genome specific trinucleotide clustering patterns, and a parsing technique for identification of polynucleotide sequences of interest. Components of the AMI profile which possess discriminatory capabilities will be identified by decomposing the profile and analyzing the coefficients using both supervised and unsupervised classification.

"SOLUTION STRUCTURE OF DNA AND DNA-PROTEIN COMPLEXES The three-dimensional structure of DNA is quite dependent on sequence.           This should be intuitively obvious from the sequence specificity required        by many proteins for recognition.  The few available x-ray crystal               structures and NMR solution structures attest to this structural                 flexibility as well.  The location and orientation of potential ligand           binding functions on the DNA such as charges, hydrogen bonding and               hydrophobic sites can be modified substantially from that which one might        expect on the basis of assuming a canonical B-DNA structure.                     Consequently, we intend to continue development of the methodology for           determination of high-resolution nucleic acid structures in solution and         apply this methodology to some oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide              complexes.  This entails methods designed to improve the accuracy and            resolution of the structures determined.  Improved structures can be             obtained with more accurate and more numerous experimental distance and          torsion angle constraints, as well as improvements in calculating                structure from these constraints.  Enhancements will result from                 improvements in our iterative complete relaxation matrix program                 MARDIGRAS, development of a more encompassing density matrix approach for        analysis of spectra derived from any pulse sequences (even those not yet         invented), development of tailored excitation pulses, inclusion of               experimental molecular motion information, and development of alternative        methods of reducing experimental structural constraint data to                   structures.  The latter includes (a) for restrained molecular dynamics           simulations, use of improved force fields, empirical development of              improved force fields, and use of constraint terms permitting a more             realistic picture of conformational flexibility, and (b) development of          an alternative restrained Monte Carlo method in torsion angle and helical        parameter space, which is quite promising especially for structure               refinement directly against NOE intensities.

"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins.

"PREDICTIVE TOOLS FOR DNA STRUCTURE AND REGULATORY SITES In the genome sequencing era, findings genes and their regulatory regions        is fundamental to our basic understanding of biology, and also to the            progress of future medical technologies such as gene therapy. recent             results suggest that DNA 3D structure plays an essential role in gene            regulation. The long term objective of this project is to develop a              versatile data mining software application for the visualization of DNA          structure, the efficient prediction of regulatory sites, especially              promoters, and the discovery of relationships between DNA structure and          functional elements. The specific aims are: (1) to integrate DNA                 structural scales, such as bendability or propeller twist angle, with our        current machine-learning software environment (Hidden Markov models,             Neural Networks); (2) to train expert modules to discover structural             signatures from primary sequence information; (3) to develop and implement       and efficient promoter prediction/classification tool. The novelty in this       approach is the combination of DNA structural information with machine-          learning techniques to automatically extract and visualize relevant              information from large amounts of raw data. The computational tools are          constructed using an object-oriented foundation designed to scale up with        data expansion and complexity.                                                                                                                                    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                 The proposed research will generate bioinformatics tools for the                 visualization of DNA structure and the detection of regulatory regions. In       particular, the prediction and understanding of promoter regions                 constitute and important component of a complete gene finding solution and       a necessary step towards gene therapy. All biotechnology companies are           strong potential users of such tools.                                             n/a",PREDICTIVE TOOLS FOR DNA STRUCTURE AND REGULATORY SITES,2793647,R43GM059002,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' genetic promoter element', ' genetic regulation', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' informatics', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' nucleic acid structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,"NET-ID, INC.",R43,1999,95795,0.097236951
"GENETIC DATABASES--APPLICATIONS FOR MACHINE LEARNING Recent advances in neural network theory, in which the present authors have played a significant role, have resulted in machine learning algorithms of great power.  In an initial investigation, the authors have applied these algorithms to detecting and exploiting pattern regularities in DNA and also in amino acid sequences.  In the two situations considered thus far (determination of whether or not a fragment of DNA codes for a protein, and predicting protein secondary structure given amino acid sequence) the results of the neural net analysis technique equals or exceeds results of conventional methods.  We propose to intensively investigate these two problems with the goal of verifying and expanding our initial results, particularly to DNA sequences of other species, especially humans.  We plan to expand our investigations to include pattern recognition searches for promoter/terminator sequences, intron/exon splice junctions, and other regulatory signals.  Methods for the sequence to structure problem will be extended to include new results in energy minimization techniques for analogue models that contain numerous local minima.  Different network architectures and different representations for the data will be investigated.  When a neural net method exceeds a conventional method in accuracy we plan to analyze the network connections with the goal of understanding what rules the network developed (by virtue of the learning algorithm) that yielded the increased accuracy.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad. NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

The method will combine Dr. Myers' new algorithm for the very fast identification of matches to a pattern allowing some number of mismatches, with improvements to an analysis and display method previously developed by the PI and Dr. Ehrenfeucht.  We expect that the method will give quantitative, graphical information about repeated patterns (allowing for some differences between instances of the patterns) that can be used to identify important features in the sequences that are typical of known functional domains of DNA and proteins.  n/a",AUTOMATED FEATURE DETECTION FOR BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCES,3374179,R01LM005094,"['artificial intelligence', ' mathematics', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,1989,76816,0.085178413
"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.   n/a",Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification,6555484,R43AI052944,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' communicable disease diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' microorganism', ' nucleic acid denaturation', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' phase change', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NIAID,IDAHO TECHNOLOGY,R43,2002,100000,0.078636905
"Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities, evidenced by their short healthy life expectancy and high all-cause and cancer mortality rates. Reasons for NatHW’s health disparities likely involve a combination of causes, including genetic susceptibility, individual and contextual socioeconomic status (SES), obesity and related lifestyle factors, smoking, healthcare access and quality, and the environment. The multifactorial basis of disparities requires an array of information and integrative approaches in research. Herein, we propose to use epigenetic biomarkers, known to reflect and mediate the combined effects of some of the genetic and environmental stressors, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of NatHW’s disparities in key carcinogenic metabolic traits. We will base the study in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), which is following the largest number of otherwise understudied Native Hawaiians (~7,850 women, ~6,120 men), as well as >201,000 older adults of mainly four other ethnicities (African American, Japanese American, Latino, white) since 1993-1996 with comprehensive characterization. Research to date indicates that there are significant sex and racial/ethnic differences in the human DNA methylome and in DNA methylation age (DNAm-age) acceleration. Thus, to enable an initial study in the MEC of leukocyte DNA methylation as a likely mediator of NatHW’s health disparities, we request a supplement to the MEC grant (U01 CA164973) in response to NOT-OD-20-048. We will analyze the archived leukocyte DNA samples in the Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS), which is a cross-sectional subset of the MEC, using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC bead chips. This will allow us to compare genome-wide methylation patterns and DNAm-age parameters in 140 NatHW and 140 white women, aged 60-77 years at the time of blood collection. We plan to (Aim 1) compare the DNA methylation patterns by constructing a DNA methylation score (DNAm- score) for NatHW vs. white women using penalized logistic regression of ethnicity on methylation at CpGs, adjusted for % Native Hawaiian genetic ancestry. Based on the selected differentially methylated genes, we will infer the biological functions in pathway analysis. We hypothesize that we will discover a DNA methylation signature and accelerated DNAm-age for NatHW vs. white women. We will then (Aim 2) quantify the proportion of the excess metabolic risk in NatHW compared to white women, namely higher insulin, triglycerides, visceral fat, and liver fat, respectively, mediated through the DNA methylome, based on the DNAm-score and DNAm- age. Finally, we will (Aim 3) identify behavioral and environmental determinants of the DNAm-score or DNAm- age among the wealth of data in the MEC-APS (adulthood weight gain, total body fat, lifetime smoking, diet quality, alcohol and meat intake, physical in/activity, sleep hours, and individual and neighborhood SES). This study addresses the goal of the U3 supplement and the MEC U01 grant and may yield important insight into the mechanisms of the disparities in NatHW. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities. We propose to compare blood epigenetics, the external changes to DNA induced by both genetic and environmental influences, in NatHW and white women. This analysis nested in a large, long-term follow-up study will allow us to understand better which lifestyle and environmental risk factors, to what extent and for which physiologic functions increase the disease-causing metabolic risk in NatHW through epigenetics.",Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement,10091327,U01CA164973,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '21 year old', 'Aborigine', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hepatocarcinogenesis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'Japanese American', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Latino', 'Leukocytes', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polynesian', 'Processed Meats', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visceral', 'Visceral fat', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'aged', 'base', 'bead chip', 'carcinogenicity', 'chronic liver disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'environmental stressor', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'human DNA', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'liver function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'response', 'sex', 'trait']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U01,2020,232505,0.078105002
"Neoplastic Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predisposes to the development of colorectal carcinoma. The molecular basis of this predisposition has been studied for many years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, we know that unique global gene expression patterns occur early in IBD-associated neoplasias (IBDNs), and that hypermethylation of certain promoter regions is a mechanism of gene inactivation in these lesions. But at which neoplastic stage do these alterations occur during IBD-associated carcinogenesis? Can individual genes be identified from global genomic screens of expression, methylation, or change in copy number? Which global patterns or individual gene alterations predict early neoplastic transformation or progression? The current proposal will answer these questions by developing the following unifying hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the study of IBDNs at all stages of evolution will benefit from global, comprehensive genomic approaches that will illuminate molecular genetic carcinogenetic pathways while simultaneously discovering clinically valuable neoplastic progression biomarkers. This hypothesis will be developed by pursuing the following Aims: 1.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.  n/a",NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS,3497686,R43GM036235,"['DNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' biological polymorphism', ' computer data analysis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnostic tests', ' gel electrophoresis', ' gene mutation', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic markers', ' human population genetics', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' point mutation']",NIGMS,"GENETICS INSTITUTE, INC.",R43,1986,50000,0.07573568
"TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES The primary objective of this research is to improve automated analysis of  gel-based DNA sequencing ladders, through pattern recognition-based  translation of raw instrument data to DNA sequences. We emphasize neural  networks, adapted to particular sequencing conditions and instruments. The  performances of pattern recognition and conventional basecalling software  will be evaluated: (1) as experimental errors challenge description of the  natural allelic diversity of human adenoviral genomes; (2) for detection  and specification of heterozygous loci in diploid template experiments;  (3) for primer selection and assembly operations of large scale sequencing  projects. Distributions of basecalling errors will be analyzed in the  contexts of neighboring nucleotide identities and as results of different  sequencing strategies.    Three principal advantages are expected from pattern recognition  basecalling software: (1) analysis of contextual arrays of oligomer traces  improves basecalling accuracy; (2) specifically tasked, neural network and  algorithmic processors support on-line signal conditioning and basecalling  in real time; and (3) the signal conditioning and pattern recognition  modules support objective measures of confidence for each basecall.    This project will significantly and positively impact progress towards the  stated goals of the human genome initiative. No incremental costs for  hardware or strategic modifications are required. Cost savings can be  realized through automation of labor intensive review and editing of  primary data. Real-time basecalling supports higher throughput  instruments, exploiting faster separation of larger parallel arrays of  sequencing ladders. Objective basecall confidence parameters support  overlap assignment during sequence assembly, and should facilitate  sequence - match searches through expanding databases.  n/a",TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES,2208900,R01HG000562,"['DNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' genome', ' human genetic material tag', ' image processing', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,1995,267443,0.072815204

"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder.

"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9776011,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2019,1098375,0.068814334
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community.

"The UCSC Genome Browser This proposal describes plans to maintain and extend the UCSC Genome Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/ and its related web pages, databases, and computer programs. The web-based Genome Browser tool has been used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers who seek to understand the human genome and those of other animals, particularly vertebrates and model organisms. The browser aggregates the research results of hundreds of biomedical labs – including a wide range of biochemical assays, genetic studies, curational efforts, sequencing projects, computer analyses, and text-mining of scientific literature – into a series of tracks aligned to the underlying DNA sequence. The genome provides a natural integration framework for these diverse data sources, which the browser exploits to its fullest at a variety of display scales ranging from the single base to individual genes, entire chromosomes, and ultimately to the genome as a whole.

"COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF GENETIC INFORMATION Computerized DNA sequence analysis is currently accomplished through the use of a large set of tools, ranging from generic regular expression search algorithms for pattern-matching on large sequence databases, to specialized similarity algorithms for discovering longer sets of sequences with potential evolutionary relatedness, to sophisticated ad hoc programs for search and analysis based on higher-order properties of DNA sequences.  The proposed work would attempt to consolidate the wide range of approaches to such activities, by undertaking to treat the genome as language, bringing to bear the tools of computational linguistics to established a formal basis for describing genetic information.  This will be done using the formalism of logic grammars (or Definite Clause Grammars), and extensible, Prolog- based system for specifying languages of greater than context- free power.  This will extend DNA search capabilities well beyond the known limitations of current regular expression search programs, and should in addition subsume many specialized programs, because of the increased linguistic power available. The unified conceptual framework provided by such a system would provide a clear, hierarchical presentation of varying levels of abstraction on the genome, presenting the opportunity for (1) specifying searches for more sophisticated genetic elements over large sequence databases (such as those likely to be produced by the Human Genome Sequencing Project); (2) an interactive system for adjusting definitions of such elements to account for data; and (3) the foundation for an experiment-planning system based on a procedural interpretation of the declarative grammar.  To achieve these goals, it will be necessary to address issues of computational efficiency and systematic extensions in linguistic power, making use of current approaches to parsing and natural language processing.  n/a",COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF GENETIC INFORMATION,3431546,R03RR004522,"['DNA', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' genome', ' information retrieval']",NCRR,UNISYS,R03,1988,53391,0.063734758

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.

"High-dimensional unsupervised learning, with applications to genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical methodology for the analysis of large- scale genomic data, such as gene expression, DNA copy number, and DNA sequencing data. In genomic studies, the goal is often to identify signal in the data in an unsupervised way. For instance, given the gene expression measurements for a set of patients with lung cancer, one might wish to discover previously unknown lung cancer subtypes that are characterized by distinct gene expression signatures and that might differ with respect to prognosis or response to therapy. However, the search for signal in genomic data is made difficult by the fact that the number of variables (e.g. genes) is generally orders of magnitude greater than the number of observations (e.g. lung cancer patients). As a result, principled methods must be developed to discover signal without overfitting. Furthermore, there is a need for objective ways to assess the validity of results obtained. This proposal has four specific aims, each of which involves the development of a new statistical method for solving a problem that arises in the analysis of genomic data. Aim 1: A method to learn multiple related genomic networks at once. For instance, one might expect that the gene expression networks for cancer and normal tissues will look similar to each other, with certain specific differences. The current proposal will provide a way to learn both networks simultaneously, in order to identify gene pathways that are perturbed in cancer. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the Gaussian graphical model formulation for network estimation. Aim 2: A principled approach for simultaneously clustering the rows and columns of a data matrix (e.g. patients and genes). The standard approach for discovering signal in genomic data involves clustering rows and columns independently, but the proposed approach will have increased power to discover biologically relevant clusters. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the matrix-variate normal distribution. Aim 3: A tool for the integrative analysis of multiple genomic data types collected on a single set of patient samples. For instance, if gene expression data, copy number data, and methylation data are collected for a single set of samples, then this will allow for the discovery of subsets of patients that are characterized by particular signatures of gene expression, copy number variation, and methylation. This could lead to the discovery of clinically relevant subtypes of cancer and other diseases. The proposed approach is an extension of the approach described in Aim 2. Aim 4: A flexible framework for the validation of clusters discovered in structured genomic data, such as DNA copy number and single nucleotide polymorphism data, in order to determine whether clusters discovered reflect signal or simply noise. The proposed approach is related to cross-validation, and will be extended to develop a method for the validation of other unsupervised statistical tools, such as those described in Aims 1-3 above. The statistical tools that result from the proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major goal of research in genomics is the development of personalized medicine - treatments for cancer and other diseases that are tailored to an individual based on his or her DNA sequence or other genetic information. Though some advances towards this goal have been made, overall progress has been disappointingly slow due to the difficulty in mining through extremely large genomic data sets in order to discover disease-related information. This project addresses this difficulty via the development of new statistical methods for making sense of genomic data.           A major goal of research in genomics is the development of personalized medicine - treatments for cancer and other diseases that are tailored to an individual based on his or her DNA sequence or other genetic information.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.              The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective.

"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D. The performance and accessibility of such technology will transform the understanding and application of genomics and epigenomics, the associated clinical practices, that ability to provide precision clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making for improved public healthcare and wellbeing.",The Enzymatic Reader,9677956,R43HG010427,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Church', 'Complex', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA polymerase A', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptomics', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanopore', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2019,247611,0.045831532
"Computational Prediction of Prokaryotic Phase Variation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathogenic bacteria exhibit a remarkable degree of genetic plasticity in order to adapt to a wide array of host environments. Mechanisms of this programmed process include phase variation by DNA repeats, gene polymorphism, site-specific DNA rearrangements, and differential methylation. This variation at the DNA level translates into phenotypic changes, most often in proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions, allowing the pathogen to evade host defenses and thrive under stressful conditions. Phase variation is a particularly attractive starting point for studying this inherent genetic instability because quite an extensive database has been compiled of its occurrence. Because phase variability is an inherently dynamic process that involves mutability of the DNA sequence itself, phase variation in N. gonorrhoeae will be studied through proteomics, a field whose aim is to capture the in vivo state of the cell. Specifically, the problem of linking mass spectrometry data directly to uninterpreted genome will be addressed by introducing a novel approach that combines peptide mass fingerprint and intact protein mass spectroscopy data with a simple gene finding approach. Once protein is linked to genome, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method will be developed to predict the nature of DNA repeat that produced a given phase variable protein. This work will provide the first computational model, ultimately generalizable across species, of an important determinant of virulence. n/a",Computational Prediction of Prokaryotic Phase Variation,6787676,F32GM069094,"['Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'life cycle', 'mass spectrometry', 'mathematical model', 'microorganism genetics', 'model design /development', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'phenotype', 'prokaryote', 'proteomics', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F32,2004,47296,0.045108027

"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10041649,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,161500,0.043961554

"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression. Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression.,9861881,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,21455,0.042346911
"Biomolecular folding by ultrafast spectroscopy and high performance computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed collaborative research is to articulate a microscopic basis for biomolecular folding codes. Recent tantalizing data from ultrafast T-jump experiments reported on proteins and DNA demonstrate the importance of separating events on the ultrashort time scale for solvation and folding. Data from ultrafast spectroscopy and multiple large-scale explicit water simulations will be interpreted with principal component analysis to provide a fresh perspective to the field. Our interest is in the relationship between water configurations and biomolecular structural change that occurs in less than the 100 picosecond regime. The immediate objective, however, is to examine the role of water in early folding events that may guide (slave) hydrophobic collapse to the native structure of proteins and DMA. Specific Aim 1: Initial water events for the folding of chicken villin headpiece subdomain. The fastest known ultrafast folding sequence, chicken villin headpiece subdomain (35-residues, VHS), will be studied using ultrafast experiments and computational all-atom simulations to provide a microscopic interpretation of folding. We propose to pay particular attention to the effects of solvent. Despite the extensive experimental and theoretical work reported on VHS, critical issues surrounding a microscopic understanding remain unanswered. Specific Aim 2: Construct a microscopic understanding of DNA folding and melting of a hairpin structure. The folding and melting kinetics of a 25 residue oligonucleotide hairpin structure has been reported using an ultrafast T-jump method. Three real-time events have been observed to include the timescales of water heating (<20 ps), double-strand destacking (700 ps to 2 ns), and loss of hairpin structure (greater than or equal to us). This experimental data has motivated us to pursue a microscopic interpretation to the role of water and ions on the three-state picture of melting and folding proposed by experiment.       Public Statement: Advances in understanding how biological structures ""fold"" or attain their biochemical functional form will allow scientists and medical doctors cure diseases never considered possible before.          n/a",Biomolecular folding by ultrafast spectroscopy and high performance computing,7409385,F33GM083576,"['Affect', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Base Pairing', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'California', 'Charge', 'Chickens', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Coumarins', 'DNA', 'DNA Folding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Dyes', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Helix (Snails)', 'High Performance Computing', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Intention', 'Ions', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Leucine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phenylalanine', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slave', 'Solvents', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Universities', 'Water', 'Work', 'alpha benzopyrone', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'ear helix', 'experience', 'field study', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'melting', 'molecular dynamics', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'stem', 'villin']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F33,2008,54961,0.042017613
"Molecular Epidemiology of DNA Repair in Head and Neck Cancer Project Summary/Abstract  Tobacco and alcohol use and genetic susceptibility are major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Identification of susceptible individuals can effectively prevent this disease by avoiding tobacco and alcohol use. Tobacco carcinogens cause a variety of DNA damage in the target cells, which may lead to uncontrolled cell growth, but the cells evolve to have the mechanism of programmed cell death or apoptosis that helps eliminate cells with excessive damage to DNA and thus reduce risk of cancer. There are at least two known apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic, that lead to cell death in response to excessive DNA damage. Many genes participate in these two apoptotic pathways, and there is an established flow cytometry method to detect the apoptosis phenotype. In this new grant application, we propose to perform the phenotypic apoptosis and genotyping assays in 600 newly recruited cases and 600 controls and to perform genotyping assays with stored DNA samples from previously recruited 1,000 SCCHN cases and 1,000 controls. For the genotyping, we propose to focus on the common, possibly functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that either cause amino acid changes or sequence variation in the regulatory regions that may alter gene expression or are reportedly associated with risk of smoking-related cancers. A total of 88 possibly functional SNPs in 45 apoptosis-related genes will be genotyped by the Taqman genotyping method using genomic DNA from 1,600 SCCHN cases (600 prospective and 1,000 retrospective) and 1,600 cancer- free controls (also 600 prospective and 1,000 retrospective). Our specific aims are: AIM 1: To determine the association between the apoptotic phenotype of lymphocytes and risk of SCCHN in 600 prospectively identified cases and 600 hospital-based controls frequency matched by age, sex, ethnicity/race and residence. We will test the hypothesis that lower levels of apoptotic capacity are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. AIM 2: To determine the functional relevance of selected common variants in apoptotic pathways in the 600 cases and 600 controls by identifying genotypes that predict the phenotype. We will test the hypothesis that possibly functional genetic variants of selected apoptotic genes have an effect on the apoptotic phenotype. AIM 3: To determine the association between common variant genotypes of the selected apoptosis-related genes and risk of SCCHN. We will test the hypothesis that adverse genotypes of selected apoptosis-related genes are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. This proposed association study is highly hypothesis-driven, expanding our preliminary data on the findings of a novel p53-PHB-PIG3 apoptosis mechanism. This study will identify genetic factors that predict the apoptotic phenotype and risk of SCCHN and thus will advance our knowledge in the etiology of SCCHN. The long-term goal of this study is to identify effective biomarkers for risk assessment and to identify at-risk individuals who can be targeted for primary prevention and early detection of SCCHN in the general population. Project Narrative  This proposed study is to investigate the roles of genetic factors, as well as their interactions with tobacco and alcohol use, in the etiology of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx (SCCHN), expanding our findings of a novel apoptosis mechanism that has not been described before. Therefore, this study will help understand the underlying mechanisms of the correlation between apoptosis genotypes and phenotypes to be measured and the roles they may play in the etiology of SCCHN. The long- term goal of this study is to identify effective biomarkers that can be used to identify at-risk individuals who will be targeted for primary prevention and early detection of SCCHN in the general population. n/a",Molecular Epidemiology of DNA Repair in Head and Neck Cancer,8231996,R01ES011740,"['Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Applications Grants', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Core Protein', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'ERCC1 gene', 'ERCC3 gene', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Stability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycols', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Associated Carcinogen', 'Transfection', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'XPA gene', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer based statistical methods', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'residence', 'response', 'sex', 'tumor', 'uncontrolled cell growth']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2012,513356,0.039400017

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR RECOMBINANT DNA INVENTION DISCLOSURE The information produced by the Human Genome Project and related research        is expected to revolutionize medicine in general and recombinant DNA             biotechnology in particular. At present, however, obtaining patent               protection for novel, useful, and unobvious inventions involving the             human genome is a recognized bottleneck in the development of a globally-        competitive U.S. biotechnology industry. While much attention has been           focused on problems that occur during prosecution of patent applications,        little has centered on the quality of the input to this process: the             invention disclosure. This research will investigate whether a knowledge-        based expert system can help scientists/inventors produce better                 collaboratively-authored recombinant DNA invention disclosures in                partnership with their technology managers and patent attorneys. The             system will help scientists/inventors better understand how an                   intellectual property technology portfolio is created and managed,               resulting in better communication among the inventor, technology manager         and patent attorney. The specific objectives of this research are to: (I)        expand the project team's understanding of the communication and                 information needs of the scientist/inventor, technology manager and              patent attorney system users, (2) iteratively develop a Phase 11 system          prototype using an object-oriented programming approach, and (3) conduct         a field test of the prototype to evaluates its impact on invention               disclosure quality.

"Computational framework for analysis of microarray gene expression data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of transcripts that are differentially regulated in response to studied experimental conditions is one of critical steps in analysis of DNA microarray data. Currently employed statistical approaches become particularly ineffective for experiments with small number of biological replicates, which are prevalent in the differential expression studies. We propose to develop and validate a novel numerical framework for identification of differentially expressed transcripts, with emphasis on analysis of experiments with small number of replicates and genes with moderate levels of expression. The proposed approach is based on a novel, non-parametric method for assessment of noise distributions in microarray data, which are derived directly from the analyzed data set.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function.

"Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kevin Squire is a PhD in Electrical Engineering and former Computer Science professor with a strong interest in bioinformatics and human genetics. To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools. Through his coursework and research, Kevin will attain the necessary skills to become an independent researcher in bioinformatics and genetics.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in DNA and other genetic changes which affect how cells work. The work in this proposal uses and enhances new sequencing technology to help accurately determine exactly what changes are occurring in tumor DNA and RNA, which in turn affect protein production and the health of the cell. While much of the work is broadly applicable, the research will be evaluated in glioblastoma, the most common and most deadly form of brain cancer, and will help determine the best course of treatment for patients with this disease.           Cancer is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in DNA and other genetic changes which affect how cells work.

"High-dimensional unsupervised learning, with applications to genomics  PROJECT SUMMARY. This project involves the development of statistical methodology for the analysis of large- scale genomic data, such as gene expression, DNA copy number, and DNA sequencing data. In genomic studies, the goal is often to identify signal in the data in an unsupervised way. For instance, given the gene expression measurements for a set of patients with lung cancer, one might wish to discover previously unknown lung cancer subtypes that are characterized by distinct gene expression signatures and that might differ with respect to prognosis or response to therapy. However, the search for signal in genomic data is made difficult by the fact that the number of variables (e.g. genes) is generally orders of magnitude greater than the number of observations (e.g. lung cancer patients). As a result, principled methods must be developed to discover signal without overfitting. Furthermore, there is a need for objective ways to assess the validity of results obtained.  This proposal has four specific aims, each of which involves the development of a new statistical method for solving a problem that arises in the analysis of genomic data. Aim 1: A method to learn multiple related genomic networks at once. For instance, one might expect that the gene expression networks for cancer and normal tissues will look similar to each other, with certain specific differences. The current proposal will provide a way to learn both networks simultaneously, in order to identify gene pathways that are perturbed in cancer. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the Gaussian graphical model formulation for network estimation. Aim 2: A principled approach for simultaneously clustering the rows and columns of a data matrix (e.g. patients and genes). The standard approach for discovering signal in genomic data involves clustering rows and columns independently, but the proposed approach will have increased power to discover biologically relevant clusters. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the matrix-variate normal distribution. Aim 3: A tool for the integrative analysis of multiple genomic data types collected on a single set of patient samples. For instance, if gene expression data, copy number data, and methylation data are collected for a single set of samples, then this will allow for the discovery of subsets of patients that are characterized by particular signatures of gene expression, copy number variation, and methylation. This could lead to the discovery of clinically relevant subtypes of cancer and other diseases. The proposed approach is an extension of the approach described in Aim 2. Aim 4: A flexible framework for the validation of clusters discovered in structured genomic data, such as DNA copy number and single nucleotide polymorphism data, in order to determine whether clusters discovered reflect signal or simply noise. The proposed approach is related to cross-validation, and will be extended to develop a method for the validation of other unsupervised statistical tools, such as those described in Aims 1-3 above.  The statistical tools that result from the proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.  Project Narrative A major goal of research in genomics is the development of personalized medicine - treatments for cancer and other diseases that are tailored to an individual based on his or her DNA sequence or other genetic information. Though some advances towards this goal have been made, overall progress has been disappointingly slow due to the difficulty in mining through extremely large genomic data sets in order to discover disease-related information.

"High-dimensional unsupervised learning, with applications to genomics  PROJECT SUMMARY. This project involves the development of statistical methodology for the analysis of large- scale genomic data, such as gene expression, DNA copy number, and DNA sequencing data. In genomic studies, the goal is often to identify signal in the data in an unsupervised way. For instance, given the gene expression measurements for a set of patients with lung cancer, one might wish to discover previously unknown lung cancer subtypes that are characterized by distinct gene expression signatures and that might differ with respect to prognosis or response to therapy. However, the search for signal in genomic data is made difficult by the fact that the number of variables (e.g. genes) is generally orders of magnitude greater than the number of observations (e.g. lung cancer patients). As a result, principled methods must be developed to discover signal without overfitting. Furthermore, there is a need for objective ways to assess the validity of results obtained.  This proposal has four specific aims, each of which involves the development of a new statistical method for solving a problem that arises in the analysis of genomic data. Aim 1: A method to learn multiple related genomic networks at once. For instance, one might expect that the gene expression networks for cancer and normal tissues will look similar to each other, with certain specific differences. The current proposal will provide a way to learn both networks simultaneously, in order to identify gene pathways that are perturbed in cancer. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the Gaussian graphical model formulation for network estimation. Aim 2: A principled approach for simultaneously clustering the rows and columns of a data matrix (e.g. patients and genes). The standard approach for discovering signal in genomic data involves clustering rows and columns independently, but the proposed approach will have increased power to discover biologically relevant clusters. The proposed approach involves applying shrinkage penalties to the matrix-variate normal distribution. Aim 3: A tool for the integrative analysis of multiple genomic data types collected on a single set of patient samples. For instance, if gene expression data, copy number data, and methylation data are collected for a single set of samples, then this will allow for the discovery of subsets of patients that are characterized by particular signatures of gene expression, copy number variation, and methylation. This could lead to the discovery of clinically relevant subtypes of cancer and other diseases. The proposed approach is an extension of the approach described in Aim 2. Aim 4: A flexible framework for the validation of clusters discovered in structured genomic data, such as DNA copy number and single nucleotide polymorphism data, in order to determine whether clusters discovered reflect signal or simply noise. The proposed approach is related to cross-validation, and will be extended to develop a method for the validation of other unsupervised statistical tools, such as those described in Aims 1-3 above.  The statistical tools that result from the proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6949187,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinoma', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'methylation', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'molecular pathology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'patient oriented research', 'stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2005,148500,0.031029473

"Antibiotics Around Us: Improving metagenome mining for the discovery of novel natural products from microbial communities. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, small molecule metabolites produced by bacteria have been a major source of lead compounds in the development of clinically used antibiotics - representing more than 60% of the FDA approved anti-infective agents currently on the market. Many of these clinically useful antibiotics are the metabolites of cultured bacteria bu the majority of environmental bacteria cannot be explored for antibiotic production using traditional laboratory techniques. It is possible to access the untapped biosynthetic potential of this uncultured majority of environmental bacteria by isolating and directly cloning their high molecular weight DNA from the environment (eDNA) and expressing the DNA in heterologous bacterial hosts. Cosmid libraries constructed from eDNA typically contain tens of millions of clones, a number that ensures the capture of the genomes of the majority of previously inaccessible bacteria but which presents a financial and logistical challenge to those wishing to screen these libraries for the production of metabolites.  This proposal will address these aforementioned issues by developing and improving sequence-targeting tools to allow for the rapid exploration of environmental DNA for novel antibiotic production. As a proof of concept, these new approaches will be evaluated for their ability to identify new derivatives with potentially improved antibiosis activity for the recently discovered antibiotic, teixobactin. New methods will also be developed and employed in the discovery of structurally novel antibiotics linked only to teixobactin by the biosynthesis of its rare non-proteinogenic amino acid, enduracididine. For Aim 1 of this proposal, the trainee will first sequence and clone a diverse set eDNA samples identified to be rich in the target gene clusters. In Aim 2, the trainee will screen and annotate the metagenomic libraries for teixobactin-like NRPS genes and enduracididine biosynthesis genes and the recovery of gene clusters containing these genes. In Aim 3, the trainee will heterologous express the recovered and reassembled gene clusters and complete the functional analysis of antibiotics encoded by these clusters. All together, these endeavors will not only result in innovative tools to fully explore the environment for novel and otherwise inaccessible antibiotics, but will also tangibly generate new natural teixobactin derivatives and medically significant enduracididine-containing molecules.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial natural products have led to the development of more than 60% of the FDA approved anti-infective agents, but only about 1% of environmental bacteria can be cultured in the laboratory setting. It is possible to access the untapped biosynthetic potential of this uncultured majority of environmental bacteria by isolating and cloning their DNA into an amenable host strain for heterologous expression. This proposal will develop and improve metagenomic screening tools to allow for the rapid exploration of environmental DNA for novel antibiotic production.        ",Antibiotics Around Us: Improving metagenome mining for the discovery of novel natural products from microbial communities.,9120628,F32AI124479,"['Address', 'Anabolism', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiosis', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Chemistry', 'Cloning', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cosmids', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic state', 'Growth', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular Weight', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Element', 'Sampling', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Variant', 'aminoacid biosynthesis', 'analog', 'base', 'citizen science', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'soil sampling', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIAID,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,33400,0.029807241

First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations.

"AC IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY FOR HIV DNA DETECTION DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) This project                proposes a biosensor for the detection of DNA fragments specific to HIV.         The sensing element will be an interdigitated array (IDA) having single          stranded DNA immobilized between the array's digits. Immobilized DNA             strands will be complimentary to a conserved sequence in the HIV target          thus allowing selective detection. Electronics capable of measuring              impedance changes will be the detection of the hybridization of                  complementary DNA strands. Impedance spectroscopy, i.e., multiple                frequency impedance measurements, will be used to completely characterize        the sensor's response. The resulting impedance spectrum will be treated          by Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to isolate the hybridized DNA response          from non-specifically adsorbed species and other matrix effects. The             technological innovations which will result from the project include a           sensitive and specific HIV DNA detection scheme which would be applicable        to any DNA assay.                                                                 n/a",AC IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY FOR HIV DNA DETECTION,2005782,R41AI041251,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' electrical impedance', ' electrochemistry', ' electrodes', ' human immunodeficiency virus', ' interferometry', ' nucleic acid hybridization', ' spectrometry', ' virus DNA']",NIAID,"ELTRON RESEARCH, INC.",R41,1997,99999,0.025834454

Surprisingly, however, there has not yet been a detailed examination, at a genome-wide level, of how NFAT transcription factors bind cis-regulatory DNA elements and change the transcriptional profiles of cells. In this application, we address this point for CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ cytolytic T cells (CTL). A striking feature of NFAT proteins is their ability to form tight complexes with unrelated transcription factors such as AP-1 (Fos-Jun) on ""composite"" elements in DNA. We have shown that NFAT in the absence of its partner AP-1 induces a negative regulatory programme of gene expression (T cell 'anergy' or 'exhaustion') that is distinct from the programme of T cell activation induced by NFAT: AP-1 complexes. Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that in the absence of AP-1, NFAT potentially functions as a 'master regulator' of CD8+ T cell exhaustion, a hypothesis that will be tested here. In Aim 1 of the application, we will examine the binding of the three immune-related NFAT proteins - NFAT1, NFAT2 and NFAT4 - to regulatory regions in genomic DNA of Th1 cells and CTL, under conditions of cooperation or lack of cooperation with AP-1. We will perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and a variant procedure known as ChIP-exo that more closely defines the binding sites for these transcription factors in DNA. We will also define the gene expression patterns regulated by these wild type and mutant NFAT proteins, by performing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) for steady-state or 'nascent' (chromatin-associated) RNA-sequencing on cells expressing the proteins. In Aim 2, we will repeat these experiments in human T cells. In Aim 3, we will implement a novel high-throughput screen to identify compounds that block the NFAT: AP-1 interaction without affecting the binding of NFAT to DNA or the formation of NFAT complexes with other partners such as FOXP3. In Aim 4, we will relate the patterns of gene expression defined in vitro in Aims 1 and 2 to the patterns obtained during immune responses in vivo, and ask whether T cells expressing mutant NFAT proteins that cannot cooperate with AP-1 induce a more profound phenotype of T cell anergy/ exhaustion during viral infections. From a clinical perspective, our project is very relevant to cancer immunotherapy and the treatment of viral infections, since CD8+ T cell exhaustion limits T cell responses in tumour-infiltrating CTL and during chronic viral infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we will investigate the functions of a protein known as NFAT, which is present in all cells including those of the brain, heart, muscle and immune system, and controls a huge diversity of cellular functions. When calcium enters cells, NFAT enters the nucleus, binds to DNA, and turns on genes important for the proper functioning of the cell. Here we propose to use cutting-edge approaches, including next- generation sequencing, to investigate the role of NFAT in T cells of the immune system. We will ask which regions of DNA are bound by NFAT and which genes it turns on during different phases of the T cell immune response. We expect to identify new regulatory mechanisms that will provide novel therapies for autoimmunity and other immune diseases.","bZIP proteins, NFAT, and lymphocyte gene induction",9527732,R01AI109842,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CD28 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcineurin inhibitor', 'Calcium', 'Calmodulin', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cyclosporine', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'FK506', 'FOXP2 gene', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic DNA', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'IRF4 gene', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Interleukin-2', 'Ionophores', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Light', 'Lymphocyte', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Myocardium', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbol Esters', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'RNA interference screen', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Skin', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'T cell anergy', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Th1 Cells', 'Time', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Transformed Cell Line', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'bone', 'calcineurin phosphatase', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'chemokine receptor', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical efficacy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'dimer', 'embryonic stem cell', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'gene induction', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'member', 'muscular system', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 2 protein', 'nuclear factors of activated T-cells', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'text searching', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor NF-AT c3', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R01,2018,732684,0.023724874

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to work in the development and application of mathematical,           statistical, and computational methods for the analysis of nucleic acid          and amino acid sequence data.

"The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A wide variety of biological processes and signals are mediated by patterns detectable at the sequence level in proteins, DNA and RNA. For example, one facet of transcriptional regulation of genes involves proteins (transcription factors) recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequence patterns. Other examples of important biological sequence patterns include protein structural domains, microRNAs and the protein target sequences of kinases. The MEME suite of bioinformatics software tools provide biologists with powerful methods for discovering, analyzing and interpreting biological sequence patterns of many types, including those mentioned above. The suite includes one tool - MEME -- that biologists use to discover novel sequence patterns (motifs), and three tools -- Meta-MEME, MCAST and MAST -- that biologists use to search sequence databases for matches to motif-based sequence models. This grant will enable us to dramatically improve the scientific value of the suite to the thousands of biologists who already use it. These improvements will be visible to the biologist using the suite as increased availability, better support, better user-interface and documentation, more powerful algorithms, better interoperability, and faster release cycles. We will achieve these goals via a combination of three specific aims: (1) improved software engineering, (2) ongoing support and (3) continued software development of the suite. n/a",The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools,6907504,R01RR021692,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'mathematical model', 'microRNAs', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure', 'transcription factor']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,307663,0.018602107
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs.

"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence.

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle.

The proposed research will tackle a unique problem, i.e., epigenetic alteration, now being considered as important as genetic mutations in cancer.  This phenomenon can be defined as a heritable change that modulates chromatin organization and gene expression without altering nucleotide sequences.  Bringing together experimental and computational biologists, our overall goals of this ICBP are 1) to increase our understanding of complex epigenetic interactions in neoplasms and 2) to use high-end information for improved prognosis, intervention, and treatment of human female cancers.  Experimental biologists will use novel microarray platforms to interrogate DNA methylation, histone modifications, loss of heterozygosity, and transcription factor binding in cancer cell lines and neoplastic epithelium and the surrounding stroma.  Computational biologists will use these experimental data for model building and refinement.  Empirical Bayesian models will be used to predict how repressors, histone deacetylases, and DMA methyltransferases are recruited to establish epigenetic gene silencing (Project 1).  Phylogenetic clustering algorithms will be developed to recapitulate genetic and epigenetic pathways in cancer stroma as they relate to tumor progression (Project 2).  LASSO logistic regression and neural network approaches will be used to model the synergistic DNA-protein interactions and the resulting change of chromatin landscape in cancer cells (Project 3).  Pattern recognition and supervised learning techniques will be used to select genes that contain the characteristics of methylation-prone sequences in drug-resistant cancer cells (Project 4).

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Computational Models of the Human Cell Cycle to Reveal Disease Mechanism and Inform Treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to develop computational models that predict how the human cell cycle responds to clinically-relevant perturbations such as radiotherapy, targeted therapy, oncogenic mutation, and directed differentiation. These models will fill a significant void in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation, progression, and treatment of diseases that involve abnormal cell proliferation. Our approach is to use quantitative single-cell imaging to measure the molecular states of proliferating cells and to integrate these data into predictive modeling frameworks. We have assembled a cross-institutional team comprising a computational biologist, two cell biologists, and a physician scientist with specialization in radiation oncology. The team has a strong and productive history of collaboration with six joint publications to date. Aim 1 investigates the mechanism by which retinal epithelial cells respond to radiation-induced DNA damage during S phase to execute G2 arrest. Time-lapse imaging and deterministic modeling will predict: how the response to DNA damage is delayed until the S/G2 transition; how a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA repair—currently involved in clinical trial—intensifies the arrest response; and how loss of the tumor suppressor p53 renders cells refractory to combination therapy. Aim 2 asks how pancreatic epithelial cells with mutations in KRAS escape permanent cell cycle arrest. We will use high-content imaging to profile multiple signaling activities in single cells expressing oncogenic KRAS. These data will be used to construct a manifold representation of cell cycle progression that spans a two-week time course of oncogenic KRAS-mediated transformation. Computational analysis of the manifold’s geometry will identify molecular branching points in G1 that govern the proliferation/arrest decision in pancreatic cells, and we will validate these predictions through small molecules and genetic manipulation. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that human embryonic stem cells inherit cell-cycle-specific gene products (specifically, G1 regulators) from the previous G2 phase to promote pluripotency in daughter cells. We will combine mitosis-specific chromatin profiling with convolutional neural network-based image analysis to identify the mechanisms by which stem cells sustain rapid proliferation and pluripotency over multiple cell-cycle generations. Each aim yields both basic and applied knowledge, providing fundamental insights into cell cycle progression under perturbation and generating specific, molecular predictions to inform new treatment schemes. With an eye toward the future, predictive models of the human cell cycle will enable patient-specific treatments for diseases that are driven by abnormal cell proliferation. NARRATIVE Many human diseases involve abnormalities in the cell cycle—the process by which cells duplicate their DNA to form two daughter cells. This project will develop computational models that can predict how the human cell cycle responds to radiation and targeted therapy; a mutation commonly observed in pancreatic cancer; and treatments used to regenerate epithelial tissues from human stem cells. Successful completion of these aims will advance our basic understanding of the human cell cycle and inform our ability to treat disease by altering cell cycle progression.",Computational Models of the Human Cell Cycle to Reveal Disease Mechanism and Inform Treatment,10033514,R01GM138834,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Activity Cycles', 'Behavior', 'CCNE1 gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Inhibition', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoderm', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Future', 'G2 Phase', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor Receptors', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Organ', 'PI3K/AKT', 'Pancreas', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'RAS Family Gene', 'RAS genes', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Induced DNA Damage', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'S Phase', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'daughter cell', 'design', 'epithelium regeneration', 'expectation', 'extracellular', 'gene product', 'genetic manipulation', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'individualized medicine', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'paracrine', 'pluripotency', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem cells', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic DNA', 'transmission process', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,307051,-0.018082406
