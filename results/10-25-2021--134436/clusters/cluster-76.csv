The candidate's career development plan includes a combination of didactic       training and research that apply computer-based patient simulations and          neural network strategies to the domain of childhood asthma.  Didactic work      will include basic programming, data basis, networks, and statistics.                                                                                             The proposed research plan has three specific aims.  In the first aim, the       candidate proposes to build on an existing set of computer-based clinical        problem solving cases to construct a comprehensive set of cases that can be      used to determine the comprehension of childhood asthma across a broad set       of audiences.  The second aim is to employ artificial neural networks to         evaluate performance on the computerized cases.  The third aim involves          implementing the computer-based cases and the neural network performance         model in three settings:  physicians in training, nursing and nurse              practitioner students, and asthma patients in the community.  To a lesser        extent physician experts will be evaluated with the system.  To achieve          these aims the candidate has garnered the help of faculty in the School of       Nursing, the Department of Medicine, and prominent members of the                educational community in Los Angeles.

"A validated asthma questionnaire for healthcare workers   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Occupational asthma (OA) is currently the       most frequently reported diagnosis of work-related respiratory disease in            developed nations. Healthcare workers (HCWs), a sector representing                  approximately 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, are among some of the                 occupational groups at risk of development of OA, with reports of increased          occurrence of asthma in nurses, animal handlers, respiratory therapists,             physicians, and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, among others. Relatively few       studies have been published with information on formal validation of asthma          questionnaires, and validation to date has largely focused on the ability of         questionnaire items to predict asthma in populations. In order to use                questionnaires to study associations between asthma and occupational and             non-occupational exposures, it is also essential that the information obtained       on these exposures be reliable and valid. Although several questionnaires exist      for the evaluation of asthma in the workplace, very few have undergone formal,       in-depth validation. Given the increasing importance of asthma as an                 occupational disease, there is a clear need for better and more reliable,            standardized survey instruments that allow the detection of asthma in different      working populations, and its characterization in relation to potential               etiologic agents and triggers. We propose to develop, validate and field test a      new survey instrument for work-related asthma among HCWs, which permits the          assessment of occupational and non-occupational exposures that may result in         the development of work-related asthma. This 3-year study will be conducted in       two phases. The specific aim of Phase I will be to develop and validate a new        survey instrument of work- related asthma, for use in healthcare settings. The       questionnaire will be validated by administering it to a convenience sample of       100 HCWs (both with and without asthma), and comparing results to ""gold              standards"" for asthma (methacholine bronchial challenge test) and                    non-occupational exposures risk factors (RAST IgE-specific antibody panel            against common environmental aeroallergens and latex). Occupational exposures        will be determined by two separate methods: a) a job-exposure matrix (JEM)           previously developed by NIOSH for use in healthcare settings, and modified to        focus specifically on asthmagens, and b) self-reported exposures, compared to        and supplemented by expert industrial hygienist review. The apriori developed        JEM will be validated and updated through a series of workplace visits to area       hospitals. The specific aims of Phase 2 will be to: 1) cross-validate and field      test the new survey instrument in a population-based sample of four                  occupational groups (nl400 per group) of HCWs (nurses, physicians, respiratory       therapists, and occupational therapists), identified through their respective        licensing boards in Texas; 2) estimate and compare the prevalence of                 work-related asthma among these four occupational groups,3) analyze                  associations between occupational and non-occupational exposures among HCWs          with and without asthma in this nonulation and 4) estimate the occunational          burden of asthma in these four occupational groups.                                                                                                                       n/a",A validated asthma questionnaire for healthcare workers,6666633,R01OH003945,"['airborne allergen', ' asthma', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' environmental exposure', ' health care personnel', ' health surveys', ' human subject', ' immunologic skin test', ' methacholine', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' questionnaires', ' respiratory disorder epidemiology', ' respiratory pharmacology']",NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2003,148500,0.48960119564969495

Healthcare workers (HCWs), a sector representing                  approximately 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, are among some of the                 occupational groups at risk of development of OA, with reports of increased          occurrence of asthma in nurses, animal handlers, respiratory therapists,             physicians, and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, among others. Relatively few       studies have been published with information on formal validation of asthma          questionnaires, and validation to date has largely focused on the ability of         questionnaire items to predict asthma in populations. In order to use                questionnaires to study associations between asthma and occupational and             non-occupational exposures, it is also essential that the information obtained       on these exposures be reliable and valid. Although several questionnaires exist      for the evaluation of asthma in the workplace, very few have undergone formal,       in-depth validation. Given the increasing importance of asthma as an                 occupational disease, there is a clear need for better and more reliable,            standardized survey instruments that allow the detection of asthma in different      working populations, and its characterization in relation to potential               etiologic agents and triggers. We propose to develop, validate and field test a      new survey instrument for work-related asthma among HCWs, which permits the          assessment of occupational and non-occupational exposures that may result in         the development of work-related asthma. This 3-year study will be conducted in       two phases. The specific aim of Phase I will be to develop and validate a new        survey instrument of work- related asthma, for use in healthcare settings. The       questionnaire will be validated by administering it to a convenience sample of       100 HCWs (both with and without asthma), and comparing results to ""gold              standards"" for asthma (methacholine bronchial challenge test) and                    non-occupational exposures risk factors (RAST IgE-specific antibody panel            against common environmental aeroallergens and latex). Occupational exposures        will be determined by two separate methods: a) a job-exposure matrix (JEM)           previously developed by NIOSH for use in healthcare settings, and modified to        focus specifically on asthmagens, and b) self-reported exposures, compared to        and supplemented by expert industrial hygienist review. The apriori developed        JEM will be validated and updated through a series of workplace visits to area       hospitals. The specific aims of Phase 2 will be to: 1) cross-validate and field      test the new survey instrument in a population-based sample of four                  occupational groups (nl400 per group) of HCWs (nurses, physicians, respiratory       therapists, and occupational therapists), identified through their respective        licensing boards in Texas; 2) estimate and compare the prevalence of                 work-related asthma among these four occupational groups,3) analyze                  associations between occupational and non-occupational exposures among HCWs          with and without asthma in this nonulation and 4) estimate the occunational          burden of asthma in these four occupational groups.                                                                                                                       n/a",A validated asthma questionnaire for healthcare workers,6370666,R01OH003945,"['airborne allergen', ' asthma', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' environmental exposure', ' health care personnel', ' health surveys', ' human subject', ' immunologic skin test', ' methacholine', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' questionnaires', ' respiratory disorder epidemiology', ' respiratory pharmacology']",NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2001,205595,0.48960119564969495
"Ambient Particulate Matter and Epithelial Cells   DESCRIPTION: (Adopted from the Applicant's Abstract): Significant questions          remain about the mechanisms by which pollutants, specifically particulate            matter (PM), elicit adverse respiratory health effects. Airway epithelial cells      are one of the first targets of ambient PM and are therefore an important model      with which to investigate PM toxicity. Granulocyte-macrophage                        colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is one cytokine released by bronchial             epithelial cells with a critical role in acute inflammation and immune               regulation. GM-CSF has an important role in asthma and elevated levels of            GM-CSF have been demonstrated in the airway of subjects with asthma. Murine          models with epithelial cell transgene expression of GM-CSF also demonstrate          allergic sensitization and the airway recruitment of eosinophils and dendritic       cells (DC). Our laboratory has demonstrated GM-CSF production in association         with upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in             primary culture human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Moreover, we now           report that the fine/ultrafine (UF) fraction of urban ambient PM upregulates         GM-CSF release by HBECs. These finding provoke basic questions about the             intracellular signals by which GM-CSF in induced that PM effects in allergic         asthma are mediated by the stimulated release of GM-CSF from bronchial               epithelial cells and the creation of local cytokine environment that supports        the recruitment and maturation of airway dendritic cells, leading to the             initiation and perpetuation of an immune response to inhaled allergen. We now        propose to address this hypothesis by three approaches: 1) Having previously         demonstrated the release of GM-CSF by HBECs in response to the fine/UF fraction      of urban ambient PM, we will now test the hypothesis that upregulation of            GM-CSF in response to fine/UF PM requires activation of Raf isoforms and MAPK        pathways that can be modified by the cytokine micro-environment (IL-4, IL-13,        IL-5, TNF-alpha). 2) We will test the hypothesis that upregulation of GM-CSF         expression in human bronchial epithelial cells is associated with specific           chemical properties of the fine/UF fraction of ambient PM and will perform           X-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography for principal component analysis. 3)       We will test the hypothesis that inhalation of fine/UF ambient PM induces a          GM-CSF-dependent recruitment and maturation of pulmonary DC in a murine model        of cockroach Ag-induced airway sensitization.                                                                                                                             n/a",Ambient Particulate Matter and Epithelial Cells,6900350,R01ES010187,"['cellular pathology', 'clinical research', 'colony stimulating factor', 'dendritic cells', 'fluorescent dye /probe', 'human subject', 'ion exchange chromatography', 'laboratory mouse', 'mitogen activated protein kinase', 'particle', 'pollution related respiratory disorder', 'respiratory epithelium', 'respiratory hypersensitivity', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIEHS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2005,330000,0.25144108061164033

"Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  To address the large discrepancy between consensus quality standards and healthcare services actually delivered to those eligible, the Institute of Medicine has called for new quality initiatives and has identified asthma as one if its priority areas. Each year, thousands of preventable deaths are attributed to asthma. The asthma-related health burden is especially pronounced in vulnerable populations. Opportunities to improve asthma care quality hinge on the capacity to comprehensively and routinely assess the care that is actually delivered to asthma patients. Current quality measurement studies require extensive clinical chart review and are not cost-effective on a public health scale. Healthcare information technology (Health IT) could have a big impact by enabling automated quality assessments. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture clinical information that could make comprehensive, cost effective quality assessment possible. However, much relevant information (and perhaps 50% or more of the necessary data) resides in free-text clinical notes, which presents a significant challenge to automated quality assessment. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient asthma care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7498546,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2008,395816,0.4869919052815476

This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7355952,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2007,421424,0.4869919052815476
"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.

"OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic pediatric disease in the United States, affecting 6.2 million or 1 in 12 children. Despite advances in the management of childhood asthma, asthma exacerbation results in approximately 550,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 80,000 hospitalizations, and hundreds of premature deaths each year. Early symptoms of asthma exacerbation, especially in children, are nonspecific and are unfortunately often not recognized by parents as asthma until the child demonstrates more severe symptoms, enough to require emergent care. The long-term goal of this STTR initiative is to empower parents to initiate timely therapy for acute asthma by supplementing their subjective assessment with an objective measure of acute asthma severity. The mobile technology we propose to develop, test and deploy toward this goal will use digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) to determine three distinct severity zones (corresponding to the green, yellow and red zones on the asthma action plan) allowing parents to follow asthma action plans accurately. The resulting improved and timely home-based management of childhood asthma should reduce current excessive ED utilization and unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality. The proposed technology is inspired by and based on the pediatric asthma severity score (PASS). PASS is used in many pediatric EDs for objective assessment of acute asthma severity to aid management of acute asthma and critical discharge and hospitalization decisions. The components of PASS are five well-studied and validated clinical parameters. Our goal in the proposed project is to develop new technology that enables parents to make similar measurements in the home setting and map those to the 3 color-coded zones for easier execution of asthma action plans. The 2 specific aims of the project are to 1) build a pediatric asthma database with ground-truth clinical findings, and 2) develop and validate DSP and ML algorithms for automated assessment of acute asthma severity. The successful completion of these aims will result in a validated technology suitable for objective, home-based assessment of acute asthma severity. Such assessment is currently possible but only in medical facilities by trained medical staff. Our Phase II goals will be to (a) further improve and deploy the technology in homes and (b) conduct a prospective trial measuring its feasibility, utilization and effectiveness in controlling asthma emergencies and costs. In Phase II, we will also pursue the necessary regulatory approvals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children associated with high rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. These problems exist because families find it difficult to recognize the symptoms of asthma. The goal of this project is to develop novel technology suitable for home use that will make recognizing the symptoms of asthma easier, leading to timely administration of medication and avoidance of serious complications.",OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING,10010457,R41NR019735,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auscultation', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergent care', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oxygen', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speech', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wheezing', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work of Breathing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic patient', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'digital', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication administration', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'premature', 'prospective', 'respiratory']",NINR,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R41,2020,257878,0.4903118017747282
"Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (DSCIC) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population. To address the critical need to create a central data and software resource for integrating and facilitating access, analysis, and dissemination of data and software generated within the PRISMS program, we are proposing the University of Southern California PRISMS Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (USC PRISMS DSCIC). Our team will work closely with the other two arms of PRISMS to coordinate and integrate outputs from the program's informatics platform centers that collect, analyze and present data from pediatric sensor-based health monitoring systems with an initial focus on pediatric asthma. We will ultimately address significant data science and tool development challenges associated with integrated monitoring systems datasets to enable important advances in our understanding of environmental determinants of pediatric asthma. Our proposal is structured around the four main research objectives specified in the RFA: 1) Integrated Knowledge Environment; 2) Data Integration; 3) Collaborative Environments and Technologies; and 4) Unified Access to PRISMS PTC Resources. The team is led by Co-PIs Drs. Jose Luis Ambite and Frank Gilliland at USC. Outdoor air pollution at levels occurring in many urban areas around the world has substantial adverse effects on health. Children in general, and children with asthma in particular, are sensitive to the adverse effects of outdoor air pollutants, includin ozone, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matter. The prevalence of asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010, while children aged 0-17 years had asthma prevalence of 9.5%, compared to adults aged 18 and over at 7.7%, for the period 2008-2010. Consistent with the increased vulnerability of children, a large and growing number of studies show that children living near traffic or high levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM have increased risks of adverse respiratory effects, such as new-onset asthma, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, school absences, and asthma-related hospitalizations. Ongoing studies also show that genetic variations in antioxidant and inflammatory genes play a role in ozone susceptibility. New methods in big data science are providing powerful tools for confronting critical research questions in asthma, in a range of areas from genomics to health informatics to environmental research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research.

"AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TELEPHONIC MGMT OF ASTHMA Asthma is a highly prevalent disease with a significant morbidity                leading to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and absenteeism from          work and school. Two major factors contributing to asthma morbidity (and         mortality) are failure to detect asthma decompensation and use of                inappropriate treatment strategies. Asthma severity can be assessed by           clinical symptoms and peak flow measurements. There are internationally          accepted guidelines for asthma management. However, rapid translation            of asthma symptoms into a change in therapy is frequently impeded by the         patient's inability to understand self management, reluctance to contact         the health care provider, or delays in feedback from the provider to the         patient. The objective of the proposal is to develop and clinically              evaluate a new Automated System for Telephonic Home Management of                Asthma.                                                                                                                                                           We describe the design and alpha testing of a dynamic relational                 database (DRdb) suitable for use either in a isolated PC or in a                 distributed computer system to support daily reporting and facilitate            all provider monitoring. The resulting DRdb accepts information about            the patient, their specific diagnoses and treatment regimens. Each DRdb          is accessible on-line, linked through LAN or WAN and captures the                patient's symptoms and measurements at the moment when they are                  reported. Because the patient's history is electronically available, the         DRdb can dynamically support the health professional to relay                    instructions immediately. Generally these instructions are pre-defined           by the patient's doctor for the reported symptom set. Automation of              these procedures may be possible.

Automation of              these procedures may be possible.                                                                                                                                 Specifically, we are developing a custom telephone interface, conducting         a clinical trial in both adult and pediatric populations in which asthma         management is under constant physician direction and where asthma                intervention is (I) computer-assisted, (II) computer-mediated, or (III)          according to conventional methods (Control Group).

"AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TELEPHONE HOME MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA Asthma is a highly prevalent disease with a significant morbidity leading        to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and absenteeism from work and         school. Two major factors contributing to asthma morbidity (and mortality)       are failure to detect asthma decompensation and use of inappropriate             treatment strategies. Asthma severity can be assessed by clinical symptoms       and peak flow measurements. There are internationally accepted guidelines        for asthma management. However, rapid translation of asthma symptoms into        a change in therapy is frequently impeded by the patient's inability to          understand self management, reluctance to contact the health care                provider, or delays in feedback from the provider to the patient. The            objective of this proposal is to develop a prototype Automated System for        Telephonic Home Management of Asthma (ASTHMA) in analogy to an existing          and successful on-line management system for diabetes.                                                                                                            Specifically, we will transform the algorithms for asthma management into        a format suitable for computer implementation, develop a computer platform       for the testing of these algorithms, and conduct off-line clinical tests         to establish the technical merit and feasibility of a prototype system.          This will be accomplished in 200-250 ambulatory children and adults with         asthma who are served in three clinics at the University of Miami School         of Medicine. A comparison between the ""mock recommendations"" of the              prototype system with the physicians' actual interventions will test the         feasibility of the computerized system. The goals of the ASTHMA system           described in this proposal are to save time (efficiency), decrease               morbidity (efficacy), and increase patient and health care provider              satisfaction (attractiveness).

"POCKET EXPERT SYSTEM FOR ASTHMA SELF-CARE Asthma is a high prevalence, costly disease. Peak expiratory flow monitoring (PFM) is an inexpensive objective measure of airway obstruction, widely used for self-monitoring of moderate to severe asthma. Along with symptoms, PFM measures drive the asthma ""action plan"". BREATH is a pocket-sized, easy to use electronic information appliance designed for use by children with asthma. It contains a digital asthma diary and dynamic action plan engine, using embedded statistical process control (SPC) logic. SPC algorithms will analyze the ""noise"" variations inherent in PFM values, creating more sensitive and specific action points. A clinic- based BREATH server uploads, stores, and analyzes data from a population of BREATH client users. Hypothesis: 1) BREATH will be accepted by children with asthma, improving record-keeping ad treatment adherence; 2) knowledge derived from SPC-analyzed PFM data will prove superior to raw PFM data in driving asthma action plans, 3) asthmatic children will experience outcome and treatment satisfaction improvements as a result. Phase I research focuses on laboratory and clinical acceptance testing with asthmatic children and expert clinicians. Phase II would refine BREATH, incorporating a peak flow meter based on new flow sensor technology, and conduct a multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial focused on outcomes and cost effectiveness. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The market for self-management aids in the health arena is growing rapidly. U.S. health policy, as reflected in Healthy People 2000, emphasizes a shift toward self-care of chronic diseases like asthma. We are targeting BREATH toward a marketplace driven by concerns for both quality care and cost with projections for a final product selling for under $250. We believe that the commercial potential for this product is large.  n/a",POCKET EXPERT SYSTEM FOR ASTHMA SELF-CARE,2868102,R43HL062813,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' asthma', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computer system hardware', ' human subject', ' medical records', ' middle childhood (6-11)', ' patient monitoring device', ' personal log /diary', ' portable biomedical equipment', ' respiratory airflow measurement', ' self care', ' statistics /biometry']",NHLBI,SOFTCARE CLINICAL INFORMATICS,R43,1999,99776,0.41274202588090886
"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8688300,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2014,1919404,0.46799843012578707

"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology.

"Phenomics: Joint Clustering to Associate Changes in Allergy and Asthma Over Time     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Pattern analyses are central in applications seeking for general guidelines. Cluster analysis is one type of pattern analysis. This application aims to develop and apply novel model-based clustering methods to a longitudinal data set from a birth cohort established in 1989 to 1990 on the Isle of Wight (IOW), UK. The proposed methods aim to jointly cluster subjects and interdependent variables aiming to improved cluster homogeneity. The word ""joint"" refers to the ability of clustering subjects and clustering of variables along with the incorporation of dependence between the two clustering processes. At the meantime, we allow the existence of non-clustered subjects/variables. We will apply the methods to identify clusters of allergic sensitizations to different allergens (ASDA) and subjects belonging to each cluster of ASDA by searching for consistent temporal trend in subsets of ASDA. Through the inferred cluster profiles, we evaluate the association between two temporal patterns: asthma/wheeze status and allergic sensitizations over time with co-morbidities considered.  Existing clustering methods (parametric or non-parametric) cannot achieve the goal stated above. These methods either cannot explain the contribution from external variables such as time (external variable) effect in allergic sensitizations (variables of interest), or overook the interdependence between different variables (e.g. allergic sensitizations to different allergens). Recent findings support dynamic allergic patterns. However, it is largely unknown (1) whether there exist a group (or groups) of allergens to which sensitizations share a similar temporal trend (natural history) such as periods of high or inert system responsive, and (2) whether dynamic allergic patterns are associated with asthma/wheeze persistence, remission, or new onset (phenomic association). This application attempts to fill these gaps, which will potentially lead us closer to the understanding of natural history of asthma, and provide strong potential to move forward the asthma prevention agenda.  The birth cohort on the IOW in U.K. comprises 1,456 children examined at birth, age 1, 2, 4, 10, and 18 years with retention >90%. The cohort has extensive phenotype data at different ages and records of environmental factors such as allergen and pollutant levels. The main variables in our study include longitudinal allergic sensitization measures and asthma/wheeze status. The proposed methods are not limited to this data set, and can be applied to any data with continuous measures on a certain number of variables, e.g. high throughput gene expression data or methylation data. Our team has a long track record of successful collaboration with biostatistical (Zhang) and epidemiological (Karmaus) knowledge at the University of South Carolina, and clinical experts (Arshad and Roberts) at the University of Southampton and David Hide Asthma & Allergy Research Center on IOW. Dr. Zhang has rich experience in statistical modeling [1R03HL095429, Zhang (MPI)]. Several projects by this group are supported by NIH including 1R01AI091905 [Principal Investigator: Karmaus] and 1R01HL082925 [Principal Investigator: Arshad]; on both projects Dr. Zhang is a key investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early prevention of asthma is essential to reduce the burden of this high-impact and avoidable disease. The novel statistical methods are able to identify clusters of individuals with consistent temporal trend of allergic sensitization against a group of allergens, which consequently enables us to assess phenomic associations (association between collections of phenotypes) between asthma and allergic sensitization. The findings will improve our understanding to natural history of allergy and asthma, and by intervening in the temporal trend of allergic sensitization, the projects have strong potential to critically impact or ability to prevent new onset of asthma.            ",Phenomics: Joint Clustering to Associate Changes in Allergy and Asthma Over Time,8610876,R21AI099367,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Method', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'South Carolina', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support Groups', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wheezing', 'asthma prevention', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'trend']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R21,2014,196290,0.35181069863819514

"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies.

"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies. Lymphoblastic cell lines will also established.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Using signatures of T-helper cell inflammation to phenotype human asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common disease characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. There is growing recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity in asthma, including in severity and response to medication. It is likely that these differences are driven by distinct underlying molecular phenotypes, the discovery of which would inform the development of targeted therapies. In prior studies using well-characterized patients with asthma, differences in gene expression from human airway epithelial cells identified two major groups of patients, one in which gene expression is strongly driven by the inflammatory the T-helper cell (Th2) cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which has been called Th2 ""high"" asthma, and another in which IL-13 driven genes are not significantly expressed above that level found in healthy controls, or ""Th2 low"" asthma. This work demonstrated that compared to Th2-low asthmatics, Th2-high subjects a better response to inhaled corticosteroids. Based on published data and our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that Th1 and Th17 pathways of inflammation define additional molecular phenotypes of human asthma. Our aims are to test this hypothesis, associate phenotypes to clinical characteristics including response to corticosteroids, and develop diagnostic tools for molecular phenotyping of human subjects based on Th1, Th2 and Th17 signatures. Th1, Th2, and Th17 signatures will be developed from microarray- based whole genome expression-profiling of cytokine-stimulated epithelial cell lines. These signatures will be used to cluster research asthma subjects into T helper subset phenotypes based on the gene expression profiles of their own airway epithelial cells obtained. The most informative epithelial cell genes will be used to develop a PCR-based test. A non-invasive test for these molecular phenotypes will be developed through the use of machine learning algorithms to find patterns in the whole genome expression profiles of subjects' peripheral blood samples. The identification of molecular phenotypes, and the availability of reliable tests to assign Th2, Th1, or Th17 phenotypes non-invasively would provide the potential to predict which medication will work best for an individual while avoiding unnecessary side effects form ineffective therapies, and to inform the development of therapies targeted to specific phenotypes by providing biomarkers during clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications. Asthma has many forms with varying triggers, long-term outcomes and responses to medications. The goals of this work are to 1) apply technological advances in human genomics to discover distinct classes of asthma, and 2) develop tests based on these classes to predict which individuals will respond to a specific therapy, leading to more efficient care and less side effects from ineffective medicines.              Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications.

"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.

"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time.

"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma.

"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life.

"Effects of Anti-Inflammatory Diet on Pulmonary Function in Pediatric Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma affects nearly 10% of American children, resulting in treatment costs alone in excess of $3 billion annually. Asthma is highly correlated with obesity and quality of nutritional in multiple cross-sectional studies, although the mechanism of this association remains speculative. Limited interventional studies in adults with asthma, relying on behavioral modification, report improvements in asthma control with caloric restriction and diets enriched with antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Low glycemic index and high fiber diets may decrease systemic inflammation, according to observational analyses and feeding studies, but this dietary strategy has not been investigated in this population. A diet harnessing the anti-inflammatory properties of multiple foods may improve pulmonary function, yet this strategy remains largely untested, especially in children. The specific aim of this projec is to evaluate the effects of a diet that is low in glycemic load and abundant in fiber, fruits, vegetables, legumes and omega-3 fatty acids (identified in this proposal as the ""anti-inflammatory diet"") on pulmonary function in lean and overweight pediatric patients with asthma. The primary endpoint will be change in forced expiratory volume in one second in response to the diet intervention. Secondary outcomes will include additional spirometry measures, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, and assessment of symptomatic asthma control. In addition, we will identify potential physiological mechanisms relating diet with lung function, including changes in systemic and adipose-specific inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and intestinal microbiome composition. Forty patients, age 10-18 years, with moderate to severe persistent asthma will be randomized to receive an anti-inflammatory diet versus habitual diet for 6 weeks, with crossover to the opposite diet for an additional 6 weeks. Both diets will be isocaloric and weight maintaining, to isolate the effects of the dietary composition from the known beneficial effects of weight loss. During the intervention period, meals will be delivered directly to subjects' homes through a novel collaboration with LYFE Kitchen (Chicago, IL), maintaining careful control of macro- and micronutrient content. During the habitual diet, participants will consume self-prepared meals. If successful, this study will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of asthma, and could inform the development of a novel, safe and easily translatable approach to asthma management. Future studies would 1) confirm the results in larger and more heterogeneous populations; 2) translate findings into sustainable interventions and 3) further explore the underlying mechanisms relating dietary intervention to lung function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a disease of airway inflammation that may be influenced by nutrition. We hypothesize that an anti- inflammatory diet will improve lung function in pediatric patients with asthma.

"Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma, the most common chronic disease among children, is one of the five most burdensome diseases in the US. While current care and research efforts focus on symptom control and exacerbation risk, children with asthma may suffer from infectious and inflammatory diseases, ie, asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) (eg, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, appendicitis, and celiac disease). Although AIICs pose serious threats to children with asthma, they are largely under-recognized, as evidenced by diabetes mellitus being widely recognized but a less common chronic illness with a magnitude similar to that for asthma. Presently, the mechanisms underlying AIICs are unknown. We postulate immunosenescence might be related, as AIICs coincide with cardinal immunosenescence features. AIICs are not clinically defined and a suitable tool has not been developed to identify children with AIICs. Thus, no strategies mitigating AIICs risks and outcomes exist. Addressing these knowledge gaps depends upon two key questions: (1) “How can asthmatic children subgroups with increased AIICs risk be identified at a population level using electronic medical records?” and (2) “What immune parameters characterize such children?” Answering these is this proposal's primary goal. To this end, our current R01 study successfully developed, validated, and implemented natural language processing (NLP)- empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for two existing criteria for childhood asthma (Predetermined Asthma Criteria, PAC and Asthma Predictive Index, API). NLP-empowered algorithm application to the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort (OCBC) enabled us to profile a subgroup of children with asthma at increased AIICs risk, disproportionately represented by children who met both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. Our new pilot data suggest asthma potentially accelerates immunosenescence leading to AIICs in a subgroup of asthmatic children. In this renewal proposal, we target this subgroup who meet both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. We will develop and apply NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for AIICs to identify such children at a population level, then characterize their immune parameters measuring immunosenescence. In Aim 1, we will develop new NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for recognized and unrecognized AIICs (NLP-AIIC) for children enrolled in Mayo Clinic `s 1997-2016 OCBC, then assess portability of NLP-AIIC at Sanford Children's Hospital, Sioux Falls, SD . In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize children with AIICs through new NLP-AIIC and NLP algorithms for asthma status, by utilizing clinical and immune parameters to measure immunosenescence. In Aim 3, we will assess changes (eg, waning adaptive immunity) over time in immune parameters measuring immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization. This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although asthma is the most common chronic disease among children in the United States, its impact on the risk of serious infections and inflammatory diseases is under-recognized.

"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes.

"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive.

"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses.

"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma.

"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist.

"Examining the effects of genes and metabolism on inflammation in asthma by leveraging an isolated founder population. Asthma is a common, chronic disease that affects millions of people of all ages globally, and the prevalence of asthma has increased markedly in recent years. Similar to other complex, chronic diseases that are also major health burdens, one of the key drivers in asthma pathogenesis is inflammation. A deeper understanding of metabolic pathways that play a critical role in inflammation, the genetic variation that underpin these pathways, and how these factors relate to asthma, is warranted. Both environmental exposures and genetic factors influence asthma susceptibility, severity and disease progression. Metabolites are also influenced by both genetic variation and environmental factors, and metabolomics is a powerful new `omics' tool for elucidating disease pathogenesis. Although inflammatory processes represent one of the key pathways associated with asthma risk to date, metabolomic studies on asthma have been limited in terms of sample size and number. Furthermore, the integration of genomics and metabolomics has the potential to clarify causal disease mechanisms. Genes encode enzymes, and the downstream effect of genetic variation on enzymatic activity is also captured by metabolomics. Genetic variants that are associated with metabolite variation are referred to as metabolite quantitative trait loci (mtQTLs). The intersection of genotype-metabolite and genotype-phenotype associations can deliver new insights into complex disease.  Between 1993-2001, our team performed a whole population ascertainment of Tangier Island, Virginia, an isolated European-ancestry population in the Chesapeake Bay. We characterized the full extended pedigree tracing back to three founders in 1722, and collected biospecimens and clinical phenotype measurements of cardiovascular and allergic disease (including asthma), on all eligible, consenting participants. This cohort also has a homogenous dietary environment typical of modern Western diets, which is itself a risk factor for inflammatory disease. Here, we propose using the Tangier Island biobank to generate a metabolomics and genomics data resource to characterize the underpinnings of asthma. Specifically, we aim to: 1A) Identify perturbations between asthma cases and controls of molecules and pathways previously known to be associated with lung inflammation; 1B) Identify sets of correlated metabolites most closely associated with asthma and its associated trait, total serum IgE (tIgE), and identify biological pathways enriched for these metabolite sets; 2) Estimate metabolite heritability to elucidate the genetic vs. environmental contribution to metabolite variation; 3) Perform mtQTL mapping and use these results to identify genetic variants contributing to the relative abundance of metabolites affecting asthma. Findings from these aims will provide critical data for a future R01 application to refine and pinpoint causal mechanisms in inflammation and asthma, and will provide an invaluable integrative omics resource to the scientific community. Inflammatory processes play an important role in a number of complex, chronic diseases, including asthma and allergic disease. In this study, we propose a closer examination of the metabolites that underlie inflammation and that are associated with asthma and associated phenotypes, and the genetic variation that in turn underpins enzymes involved in these inflammatory processes.

"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients.

"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network.

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients.

"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training.

"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts.

"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts.

"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,9824678,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2020,181719,0.35008188070223173

The work related to this NIH STTR is anticipated to begin April 2020. Prior to submitting our NIH STTR application, significant work was completed to test the viability of collecting lung function using our wearable technology. We tested on over 20 patients in the hospital, and in this study we found a positive correlation between our measurements and those of spirometry. Our NIH STTR work will build upon this. Technical, administrative, or commercial challenges and how they’ve been addressed During our customer discovery so far, we have learned about the complexities of achieving reimbursement, even if we have identified applicable CPT codes. Realizing this challenge, we selected an initial customer that will not require reimbursement. Our initial customer will be respiratory clinical trials. From our interviews, we have learned that they have a strong unmet need, they are willing to pay a large amount, and we will be able to serve them earlier than other customer types.

"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability Project Summary/Abstract The application's broad, long-term objective is to develop, evaluate and commercialize a device for continuous monitoring of a child's asthma components (symptoms, lung function variability, nighttime awakenings, etc.) over a few weeks. Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic condition in the US. It affects 6 million children, causes 0.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, 0.13 million hospitalizations and $18 billion annually in healthcare costs. To reduce the burden of uncontrolled asthma, NHLBI evidence-based guidelines require periodic assessment of the child's asthma risk/impairment, and corresponding adjustments to treatment, until asthma control has been established. When assessing asthma impairment, pediatricians depend heavily on the self-report, which is unfortunately unreliable. This leads to underestimation of asthma impairment, undertreatment, and long paths to achieving control. To efficiently and effectively establish asthma control, a wearable device could be used to provide pediatricians an accurate, recent history of asthma components. Currently, no practical solutions exist for weeks-long monitoring of symptom frequency and lung function variability, both of which are critical components for assesing asthma impairment. Via the following Specific Aims, this application will use advances in embedded systems and machine learning to develop a small, wearable device for monitoring asthma symptoms that is (1) acceptable to patients; (2) able to robustly detect cough and wheeze symptoms; and (3) able to passively measure lung function variability. Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough epsiode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Project Narrative Uncontrolled pediatric asthma is a serious public health concern. There are proven therapies and management guidelines to achieve asthma control in most patients, but poor patient self-report of asthma daily symptoms and components has made this an elusive goal in practice. This project will develop and evaluate a wearable device that provides physicians with an accurate report of their patient's recent asthma symptoms and pulmonary function variability.",An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability,9774468,R41HL146027,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'New England', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spirometry', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Vital capacity', 'Wheezing', 'asthmatic patient', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'follow-up', 'monitoring device', 'off-patent', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatrician', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"CLAIRWAYS, LLC",R41,2019,204205,0.45062029153452016
"Determining the Role of the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiota as Drivers of Concomitant Inflammatory Responses in patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma 123 456 789 1101 1123 1145 1167 1189 2201 2223 2245 2267 2289 ABSTRACT Despite growing efforts to understand the role of the microbiota in airway disease, mechanisms that link microbial community dysbiosis to chronic inflammation remain elusive. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a significant health problem in the United States, costing up to $65 billion each year and affecting up to 16% of the US population. CRS patients frequently present with pulmonary comorbidities suggesting that there are common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to upper and lower airway inflammation, known as the unified airways concept. In this proposal, we aim to understand the role of the upper and lower airway microbiota in driving concurrent immune responses in patients with CRS and asthma. Asthma is a common pulmonary disease that has strong clinical and epidemiological associations with CRS: Between 20%- 60% of CRS patients with nasal polyps have asthma. Dysbiotic microbial communities have been reported in sinuses of CRS patients and in the lungs of asthmatics, however, the microbiome or host immune response of these sites have not been examined in parallel. The goal of this proposal is to establish the existence of an upper-lower airway axis by sequencing the bacterial and fungal microbiome, profiling the host immune response, and through in vitro experiments that aim to identify bacterial metabolites in mixed-species culture that drive type-2 inflammation. Supporting the concept of a unified airway, our preliminary data show dysbiotic microbial communities in the upper and lower airways of CRS patients with asthma and concurrent type-2 inflammation shared across the airway sites. To expand these studies, we will use an integrated multi-omics approach to investigate the fundamental basis of microbiome structure and function in the context of the immune response of patient-matched upper and lower airway samples from CRS patients (with or without asthma) and healthy individuals that we have banked over the past four years. From these analyses, we will be able to infer the ecological relationships that contribute to chronic inflammation in concurrent upper and lower airway disease. In the second aim, we will determine whether and how pathogenic microbial communities drive or exacerbate airway inflammatory responses in vitro. We will characterize the metabolome in CRS/Asthma- patients and confirm these metabolites are of microbial origin in mixed species biofilm culture. To determine interaction with the host, we will sensitize peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs) with CRS-Asthma associated metabolites, then co-culture DCs with naïve T cells and quantify T cell differentiation. This study will contribute to our understanding of the upper-lower airway axis in unified airway disease and will ultimately lead to therapeutics aimed a manipulating the upper airway microbiome for treating concurrent sinus and lung disease. 1234 567  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma are significant public health problem, accounting for over 5% of the  total healthcare costs in the United States each year. Dysbiosis of the sinonasal microbiome has been  proposed as a significant driver of airway inflammation, however the composition or activities of these complex 89  microbial assemblages are not well understood. The studies proposed here will provide a high-resolution  characterization of the airway bacterial microbiome and metabolome CRS patients with asthma. Mechanistic in  vitro studies of CRS/asthma associated metabolites will uncover specific microbial mechanisms that  exacerbate host inflammatory responses in the upper and lower airways.

"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10009430,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170640,0.5473257996769146

We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,9804142,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170640,0.5473257996769146
"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma Candidate: Dr. Soyeon Kim obtained her Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Rice University. For her doctoral research, she developed statistical machine learning methods to identify biomarkers for precision medicine approaches to treating lung cancer. She is currently a post-doctoral fellow at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) and supported by a T32 grant awarded to one of her mentors, Dr. Juan C. Celedón. The goal of her research is to understand the pathogenesis of diseases by developing statistical methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. She is an author and co-author of eight manuscripts, including ones in high-profile journals such as Nature Genetics. Environment: CHP, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, is a leading pediatric center for clinical care, research, and educational excellence. Dr. Kim works in the Rangos Research Center, comprised of nine floors of state-of-the-art laboratories, offices, and conference facilities. In addition to superb mentoring by Drs. Wei Chen, Juan C. Celedón and George Tseng, she will use the Pittsburgh supercomputing center (PSC), an excellent source of computing powers for intensive bioinformatics work. Research: Although both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation play important roles in regulating gene expression, the associations between SNPs/DNA methylation and expression of disease genes in childhood asthma are mostly unknown. Due to the multiple-testing problem, most studies focus on identifying the regulation of gene expression by cis- (nearby) DNA features, rather than a combination of cis- and trans (far from genes) regulation. To overcome the major multiple-testing problem, we will develop a novel statistical machine learning method that can handle a large number of variables of omics data without multiple- testing correction issues. In Aim 1, I will identify cis and trans genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) factors that regulate gene expression in the nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. Through this analysis, I will uncover novel SNPs and methylation CpGs that may have not been found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). In Aim 2, I will estimate the genetic and epigenetic contributions to the expressions of genes that are associated with atopic asthma. This study also will classify genes that are affected the most by genetic factors and genes that are affected mostly by epigenetic factors, which include environmental factors. In Aim 3, I will develop statistical methods to identify SNPs that indirectly regulate gene expression through methylation in nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. The outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the abnormal molecular and cellular mechanisms through which asthma develops, and the application of this knowledge to help to produce new therapies for asthma. Project Narrative 6 million children in the US suffer from asthma, and the likelihood that any child will develop asthma depends heavily on their genetic and epigenetic regulations. My statistical machine learning models will identify new genetic and epigenetic risk factors that are associated with childhood asthma by regulating the expression of disease-causing or disease-preventing genes. This knowledge will help to advance precision medicine approaches to treating childhood asthma.",Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma,10038897,K01HL153792,"['Affect', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CISH gene', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Floor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supercomputing', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Work', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'differential expression', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'genome wide association study', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,141178,0.3521644267002726
"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10041169,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,178200,0.49466713313994837
