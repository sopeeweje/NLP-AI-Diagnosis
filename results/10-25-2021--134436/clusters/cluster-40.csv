"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",10018507,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,192195,0.245190257

"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,0.232068507
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9661259,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,894544,0.230499923

"Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer prevention processes are rapidly transforming. Changes in guidelines, and resulting changes in practice, stem from breakthroughs in basic research on cervical cancer and technological advances in testing, diagnosis, and prevention. For example discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has led to         development of HPV vaccines and recommendations for their use in the general public. As cervical cancer prevention practices change, we face widening gaps in our knowledge about the impact of these changes on women's health, that is, the balance of risk and harms affected by newly recommended screening intervals, and how this balance differs for vaccinated and unvaccinated women. We also need more information about barriers to screening uptake and adherence to guidelines screening intervals. To address these gaps, we propose supplementing our Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS) PROSPR Research Center with a Cervical Cancer Unit that will collect population-based data and work with the PROSPR network to guide studies of the cervical cancer screening process. Our study team, located at Group Health Research Institute, has access to extensive data from Group Health, a health care and coverage system in Washington State. Multilevel data are available from patients (e.g., characteristics, screening dates, cancer outcomes), providers (e.g., specialty), and facilities that include both health system owned-and-operated clinics and contracted community affiliates. Group Health members represent a diverse population of patients who receive care under a range of insurance coverage programs available in the US, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to new plans offered beginning January 1, 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Our study team is well positioned to carry out this proposed work. We are already closely linked to Group Health clinical providers, and have a breadth and depth of experience in cervical cancer screening research that includes knowledge of Group Health data systems and methods for extracting information from these systems, and up-to-date methodology including study design and analysis of complex data.         Public Health Relevance:  Cervical cancer screening recommendations have undergone dramatic changes, shifting from annual Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to 2- to 3-year rescreening intervals, and incorporating HPV DNA testing. This supplement to our PROSPR Research Center will enable our team to provide population-level data to improve our understanding of the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening as practiced.                ",Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS),8791225,U54CA163261,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Commit', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cytopathology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Northwestern United States', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'anticancer research', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'care delivery', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized data processing', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'stem', 'uptake']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,649872,0.22920068
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7340158,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,121564,0.226112295

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9237818,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,738377,0.222440143

"Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR project, we present EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of- care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device comprising of a smartphone-attachable retinal imaging camera and validated software application enabling fully-automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is the leading cause of new-onset blindness in working-age adults in the industrialized world today. Studies show that in 90% of the cases vision loss can be prevented if DR is diagnosed at an early stage.  Recommended annual screening is expected to significantly improve outcome for diabetic patients, but even in the developed world, majority of the diabetics do not regularly have the annual screening due to several limiting factors. To make things worse, the current cost of screening all diabetics to detect those with early DR is very high because: (a) most patients will have normal exams (thus, causing inefficient use of specialist's time), (b) retinal imaging equipment is very expensive, and (c) trained technicians must operate the imaging equipment. In this project we address these critical limitations by employing cellphone retinal camera attachment, the Ocular CellScope, developed by our collaborators at UCB/UCSF, which simply attaches to an iPhone, doesn't need a trained technician to operate, will obtain wide-field images, and will cost several orders of mag- nitude less than the current tabletop retinal imaging cameras. Diabetic patients can attach the camera to their smartphones and with some assistance (untrained friend, spouse, or nurse) obtain retinal video for each eye using an app residing on the same phone. This app guides the image capture to ensure that best quality frames are obtained, and also ensure all areas of the eye are imaged enabling wide-field imaging. EyeApp's validated algorithms output a near-instant DR screening recommendation score. EyeApp is con- ceptualized as a culmination of over three years of research and development at Eyenuk (on computerized DR screening) and at UCB/UCSF (on smartphone retinal camera) that has already produced functional prototypes of critical technology modules. This phase I project focusses on seamless integration of these proven modules (the camera hardware and the diagnostic software) via several novel ideas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of-care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device, will truly enable diabetic retinopathy screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent - since the world diabetic population is estimated to be a staggering 371 million, and is projected to grow to over half a billion by 2030. EyeApp will operate in and end-to-end fashion, from retinal imaging to diagnostic screening, all without needing a trained operator. It will cost orders of magnitude less than conventional retinal cameras, and will simply attach to a smartphone, thus greatly reducing the cost and expanding the availability of screening to vast underserved population in the US and the world.            ",Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera,8782362,R43EY024848,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Chairperson', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'screening', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2014,217002,0.214946693
"Oral Cancer Screening via Spectral Cytopathology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Application is submitted in response to PA-09-238 ""Exfoliated Cells and Circulating DNA in Cancer Detection and Diagnosis"" under the R21 funding mechanism. The work proposed in this application is aimed at developing automatic screening methods for oral and nasopharyngeal cancer, based on Spectral Cytopathology (SCP) which is a new diagnostic method based on a spectroscopic measurement of individual cells coupled to computer-based analysis. Proof-of-principle for detecting abnormal cells from the oral cavity via SCP was achieved, and identification of abnormal cells was found to be possible even before morphological changes occur in the cells. This proposal emphasizes the clinical significance of oral cancer screening by spectral methods; furthermore, it will extend the study to other parts of the head-and-neck (H&N) region, and collect datasets of sufficient size to attract other funding mechanisms to take this research to a commercial product. Oral and H&N cancer screening was selected for a target because such screening is not being carried out at this point, although cancers of the oral cavity are a major health problem, with a mean 5- year survival rate less than that of cancers which are more in the public's view, such Hodgkin's lymphoma, testicular cancer, or malignant melanoma. As in all epithelial cancers, early detection and treatment will increase the survival rate from H&N cancers, which presently are detected often after they have penetrated deeply into the surrounding tissue, or have formed metastases. SCP-based oral and H&N cancer screening can be carried out as easily as cervical cancer screening, and will reduce the complications and mortality from this disease.  Project Narrative Cancers of the oral cavity and the head-and-neck (H&N) region are very dangerous, with a 5-year survival rate of only a little over 50 %. This is partially due to the fact that they are asymptomatic, and consequently, often are detected too late for complete cure. Furthermore, these tumours have high rates of recurrences, for reasons that are not fully understood. Thus, routine screening for these diseases during dental examinations will allow an earlier treatment regiment, and will decrease to morbidity drastically. Routine cytological screening for cervical cancer has similarly reduced the morbidity since it was first introduced in the late 1940's. The work proposed here will utilize a methodology known as Spectral Cytopathology (SCP), established by the PI, to assess its efficacy in a clinical setting established with Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Dentistry. The proposed work will refine the methodology for the application of SCP to H&N cancers, including those of the oral cavity, and produce sufficiently large datasets to initiate pre- clinical and clinical trials.",Oral Cancer Screening via Spectral Cytopathology,8088196,R21CA153148,"['Abbreviations', 'Abnormal Cell', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Boston', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collecting Cell', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Coupled', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Cytopathology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Epithelial', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fixatives', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gender', 'Gene Structure', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Part', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes Simplex Infections', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of nasopharynx', 'Malignant neoplasm of testis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neck', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nicotine', 'Normal Cell', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Dentistry', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'tissue fixing', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2011,164034,0.210346637
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment.

"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry.

"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,0.204348597
"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite large increases in screening in the past two decades, colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Our research has shown that 60% of these deaths could be prevented by better use of available screening interventions. In this proposal, we use microsimulation modeling to evaluate and help prioritize interventions to further reduce the burden of colorectal cancer.",Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control,10069899,U01CA253913,"['Address', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1252212,0.20226694
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9751381,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient screening', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9236094,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aged', 'base', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,9943464,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,800637,0.167392405
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health. The tools proposed in this research may provide a low-cost, scalable method to improve detection of cognitive decline.",A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings,10091002,R61AG069729,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Appointment', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Health system', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'care providers', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'patient health information', 'patient screening', 'population health', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R61,2020,564218,0.159928284
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment. Larger patient populations could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing mortality.","Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients",10033192,R01CA252216,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Boston', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Endoscopic Biopsy', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal mucous membrane', 'Esophagus', 'Family suidae', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'advanced disease', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'capsule', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'navigation aid', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,336293,0.149252637
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,9881199,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,137488,0.148479798
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time.

"Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite their potential to reduce cancer burden through early detection, the effectiveness of screening programs is often undermined by systems-based factors and human factors. The broad aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a computer-based technology called TRACS to monitor the process of cancer screening in individual patients and intervene as necessary to ensure that the screening is conducted reliably and effectively. Interventions in TRACS consist of reliable notifications to clinicians and/or patients. However, unlike many other reminder systems, TRACS continues to monitor the care of the patient subsequent to the notification.       In this phase of the application, TRACS will be used to address the reliability of follow up of abnormal or equivocal results from screening mammography for breast cancer. A knowledge module will be created in TRACS knowledge base for the monitoring of the follow up of abnormal screening mammograms. A knowledge module comprises the process definition that specifies the appropriate course of actions for a clinical scenario and logical rules for making decisions within the process. In the next phase, additional knowledge modules will be included for comprehensive support for screening of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colon cancer.       An important feature of TRACS will be the ability to extract information from clinical text documents using a natural language processing engine called HITex. Reports of several cancer screening tests, such as mammography, cervical smear, and colonoscopy, are in the form of text documents. Thus it is important to be able to extract relevant information from these documents for use by TRACS. HITex will be customized to extract the recommendations of the radiologist from screening mammogram reports. Specifically, it will extract whether the radiologist recommends a non-routine follow up. If that is the case, HITex will extract the recommended follow up (e.g., diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or needle biopsy).       TRACS will be deployed and evaluated at the New England Medical Center (NEMC), a large urban medical center in Boston. The first step in the evaluation will be to confirm that information from screening mammogram reports from NEMC can be extracted accurately by HITex. During this phase, the TRACS software and the abnormal mammography follow up knowledge module will be tested in a simulated setting at NEMC. The tests will be conducted using records of patients who had previously undergone screening mammography at NEMC. The behavior of TRACS for these cases will be rated by a panel of experts from NEMC. In the next phase, TRACS will be deployed operationally at NEMC. Project Narrative The software proposed to being developed under this project aims to improve the early identification of a number of commonly occurring cancers. It will do so by following up reliably on the management of those patients that have abnormal results in cancer screening tests.          n/a",Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System,7481710,R43CA134042,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Boston', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Closure', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mammography', 'Medical center', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Puncture biopsy', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Schedule', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Simulate', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer generated', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCI,U.S. CARELINK,R43,2008,122518,0.146542125
"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the         United States today.  In an effort to reduce mortality, Congress                 recently included a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to              support screening colonoscopy as a means for early detection and removal         of colorectal polyps, the precursors to cancer.  In this country alone,          more than 68 million people are eligible for colorectal screening, but           the majority are unlikely to comply with screening recommendations               because of the costs, risks, discomfort, and inconvenience associated            with traditional endoscopy.  Furthermore, even if a small fraction of            eligible persons are examined, the number of available                           gastroenterologists would be insufficient to perform so many procedures.                                                                                          We have developed a new technique, called virtual colonoscopy (VC), as           an alternative to screening diagnostic colonoscopy (DC). The procedure           consists of cleansing a patient's colon, inflating the colon with air,           scanning the abdomen with helical computed tomography (CT), and                  generating a rapid sequence of three-dimensional (3D) images of the              colon by means of virtual reality computer technology.  Although VC              makes possible the visualization of 3D images of the colon in a manner           similar to that of DC, a correct diagnosis depends upon a physician's            ability to identify small and sometimes subtle polyps within hundreds            of 3D images.  The absence of visual cues that normally occur with DC            makes VC interpretation tedious and susceptible to error.                                                                                                         With support from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we have             developed a computer-assisted polyp detection (CAPD) system that                 calculates areas of abnormal colon wall thickness in helical CT image            data in order to highlight potential polyps in the 3D images.  A                 physician ultimately determines if each detected lesion represents a             true abnormality.  Although we have found CAPD to be sensitive for               finding subtle abnormalities, poor specificity can be attributed to              several obstacles, including imprecise image segmentation, limited               feature analysis, and suboptimal bowel preparation prior to helical CT           scanning.  With these challenges in mind, we propose research to perfect         CAPD. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To develop an image                   segmentation algorithm that accurately isolates the colon from helical           CT image data; 2. To improve our polyp detection algorithm with expanded         feature analysis and artificial intelligence methods; 3. To optimize             bowel preparation with digital subtraction of opacified feces and                controlled gas distention; and 4. To validate the accuracy of VC, with           the modifications achieved in the stated aims, by comparing the results          of VC and DC in 200 patients undergoing usual-care colonoscopy.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications  Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of in- surance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image pro- cessing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic dia- betic population.

"CERVICAL CANCER DETECTION AND SCREENING (PHASE II) The objective of this research is to develop new and improved diagnostic instrumentation for cervical cancer detection and screening.  The techniques employed are based upon high-resolution digital imaging technology.  A 5-year study just completed has clarified and quantified, for the purposes of cytology automation, the concepts exploited in traditional human cervical cytology screening, i.e., the detection requirements of the Pap smear screening ""system"", the cell detection capabilities of trained cytotechnologists, and the interrelationship of these factors.  In addition, these studies proved that state-of-the-art image processing detection of suspicious and abnormal cells is as good as, or better than, highly trained cytotechnologists.  The research and development, herein (Phase II), is to further specific aspects of the computer software design and to develop the conceptual design of a feasible diagnostic instrument.  The expected results from the Phase II development would be completed software algorithms and other system parameters in a specific design.  The potential commercial application of this research is in the area of clinical laboratory instrumentation and testing.  The public health benefits include:  (1)\a potential increase in accuracy and reproducibility in the routine performance of the Pap test; (2)\a possibility of standardization from one screening laboratory to another; and (3)\the potential capability of a more ready availability of this test to the general public.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,0.129036779
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10050712,R61AG068947,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccination', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'cancer health disparity', 'clinical care', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'design', 'discounting', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness testing', 'end of life', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention cost', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'racial and ethnic', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening disparities', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,329875,0.126370403
"Computerized Detection of Polyps in CT Colonography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented if precursor colonic polyps are detected and removed. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to advance the early detection of colon cancer. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has been proposed as a promising technique for colon cancer screening, but for CTC to be a practical screening tool, many images must be interpreted rapidly and accurately. To this end, the short-term goal of the project is to develop a high-performance computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for the automated detection of polyps in CTC to assist radiologists in detecting polyps quickly and accurately, by providing them with a ""second opinion"" regarding the locations of suspicious polyps. We hypothesize that a CAD scheme can significantly reduce radiologists' interpretation time and improve their performance in detecting colonic polyps in CTC. To explore this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Establish a large CTC database of polyps to develop and evaluate a CAD scheme: (1) Collect new CTC cases of polyps retrospectively and prospectively. Specific Aim 2. Develop methods for the detection of polyp candidates: (1) Generate isotropic volumetric data from axial CT images; (2) Develop methods for automated extraction of the colon based on apriori knowledge of the abdominal anatomy; (3) Develop methods for extraction of polyp candidates based on geometric features. Specific Aim 3. Develop methods for the reduction of false positives: (1) Develop methods of clustering of polyp candidates to merge polyp candidates and to remove false positives due to noise; (2) Develop methods based on 3-dimensional volumetric features that differentiate polyps from false positives due to normal anatomic structures; (3) Use diseriminant analysis, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms to merge volumetric features for the reduction of false positives. Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the performance and benefit of the overall CAD scheme: (1) Evaluate the performance of the CAD scheme in the detection of polyps in CTC. (2) Evaluate the benefit of the CAD scheme in reducing radiologists' interpretation time and improving diagnostic performance in the detection of polyps by means of an observer study.

Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has been proposed as a promising technique for colon cancer screening, but for CTC to be a practical screening tool, many images must be interpreted rapidly and accurately. To this end, the short-term goal of the project is to develop a high-performance computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for the automated detection of polyps in CTC to assist radiologists in detecting polyps quickly and accurately, by providing them with a ""second opinion"" regarding the locations of suspicious polyps. We hypothesize that a CAD scheme can significantly reduce radiologists' interpretation time and improve their performance in detecting colonic polyps in CTC. To explore this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Establish a large CTC database of polyps to develop and evaluate a CAD scheme: (1) Collect new CTC cases of polyps retrospectively and prospectively. Specific Aim 2. Develop methods for the detection of polyp candidates: (1) Generate isotropic volumetric data from axial CT images; (2) Develop methods for automated extraction of the colon based on apriori knowledge of the abdominal anatomy; (3) Develop methods for extraction of polyp candidates based on geometric features. Specific Aim 3. Develop methods for the reduction of false positives: (1) Develop methods of clustering of polyp candidates to merge polyp candidates and to remove false positives due to noise; (2) Develop methods based on 3-dimensional volumetric features that differentiate polyps from false positives due to normal anatomic structures; (3) Use diseriminant analysis, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms to merge volumetric features for the reduction of false positives. Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the performance and benefit of the overall CAD scheme: (1) Evaluate the performance of the CAD scheme in the detection of polyps in CTC. (2) Evaluate the benefit of the CAD scheme in reducing radiologists' interpretation time and improving diagnostic performance in the detection of polyps by means of an observer study. Successful development of such a CAD scheme will advance the clinical implementation of CT-based colon cancer screening, promote early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reduce mortality due to colon cancer. n/a",Computerized Detection of Polyps in CT Colonography,6908181,R01CA095279,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'colon', 'colon polyp', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer data analysis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'early diagnosis', 'endoscopy', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'health care personnel performance', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'mass screening', 'mathematical model', 'neoplasm /cancer radiodiagnosis', 'patient oriented research']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2005,389375,0.113281986

"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,0.104313548
"Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Bladder cancer is the fifth cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Often the cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage after the patients have developed symptoms, explaining their high mortality rates. Since most colon cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated. Unfortunately most people do not follow this recommendation. A similar situation exists for bladder tumor staging. The health relatedness of this project is to dramatically increase the number of people willing to participate in screening programs by offering a convenient, nearly risk-free procedure. Virtual colonoscopy (VCon) and virtual cystoscopy (VCys), as new procedures in which computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images of the patient's abdomen are taken and a computer visualization system is used to virtually navigate within a constructed 3D model of the colon or bladder, has demonstrated the potential for colon cancer screening and bladder tumor evaluation. We have been contributing the VCon and VCys development for several years. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop 3D texture-based computer aided detection (txCAD) techniques to facilitate VCon and VCys as accurate, cost-effective, non-invasive, comfortable techniques to screen large segments of the population. The Phase I specific aims are: (1) To develop tissue-mixture image segmentation mitigating the partial volume effect. (2) To extract the mucosa layer and cleanse the lumen space of the hollow organs from the segmentation. (3) To identify suspicious patches in the mucosa layer with high sensitivity and reasonable false negatives. (4) To obtain the entire volume of each suspicious patch. The Phase II aims are: (5) To extract 3D geometrical, morphological and texture information from each suspicious volume. (6) To classify the extracted features using learning machine to eliminate false positives. (7) To evaluate the performance of the proposed txCAD on a patient database of over 200 cases.

"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes.

This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes.

The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9373907,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,208522,0.100733063
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening.

"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner.

"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.

"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,0.09597308

"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes.

Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries.

"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,0.09410376
"BETTER CANCER SCREENING BY COMPUTERIZING MEDICAL RECORDS This project will provide a computer product linked to patient data that alerts Famly Medicine physicians to when a patient needs cancer screening.  The product, VoiceFM, creates a patient record as the physician speaks into a microphone connected to a 386 IBM-compatible personal computer.  Software converts single words into text, which the program uses as current data when it checks past patient data, in ""real- time."" If a cancer screen is needed, the physician can recommend it with a single command.  VoiceFM derives from VoiceEM, a successful products that builds an Emergency Medicine record with voice commands.  VoiceFM has a database management program, ChartFM, that serves as an electronic chart.  Once physicians become adapt at this new techmology, we will add advice resources such as PDQ.  Phase I will refine VoiceFM and ChartFM to promote use at the Family Medicine department in San Bernardino.  Then we will activate cancer screening prompts.  Phase II will apprainse the effect of prompts on the rates of appropriate recommendations for women over 50 due for either a pap smear or a mammogram.  We will compare the rate on randomly chosen days when the prompts are on, to the rate on days when they are off.  n/a",BETTER CANCER SCREENING BY COMPUTERIZING MEDICAL RECORDS,3492608,R43CA053022,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated medical record system', ' cancer information system', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mammography', ' mass screening', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' personal computers', ' physicians', ' voice']",NCI,"MEDICAL HORIZONS, INC.",R43,1991,50000,0.087260438
"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patient’s SUD risk level.",SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care,9897003,R43DA050218,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Assessment tool', 'Blinded', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'reduced substance use', 'referral services', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2020,229810,0.086600237
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors. The proposed tools will also enable quick turnaround time for screening, thus further helping prevent blindness due to diabetes complications.              Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors.

"Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer ABSTRACT Cervical cancer affects the lives of half a million women worldwide each year. Over half of these women die, even though cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination or early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical pre-cancer. Cervical cancer prevention consists of three visits in the U.S.: 1) screening using the Papanicolaou smear; 2) colposcopy followed by biopsy of cervical abnormalities for women with positive screening results; 3) treatment by excising the lesion using a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) for women with cervical pre-cancer. This three-visit model is not practical for use in medically underserved regions due to the technologies and expertise needed and patient attrition between clinic visits. Our team has already developed a novel Pocket colposcope and machine learning algorithms that when combined provide high-quality, magnified visualization and automated diagnosis with comparable performance to standard-of-care colposcopy. However, screening and diagnosis alone will not lead to decreases in cervical cancer mortality if access to point-of-care treatment is limited. Recently, the thermocoagulator has gained acceptance for ablation of cervical pre-cancer lesions as it does not require consumables (continuous supply of pressurized liquid nitrogen for cryotherapy) or a stable power supply (for LEEP). However, low-cost thermocoagulators have frequent failures based on reports of field-testing and the more reliable versions cost more than $10k. To address these well-documented shortcomings, our group is working to establish a low-cost ablative therapy using a ubiquitous agent, ethanol to treat cervical pre-cancer. While ethanol ablation has a long history of clinical use, its direct injection into tissue leads to non-uniform distribution and hence low efficacy in the region of interest. We propose a new formulation of ethanol using a polymer called ethyl cellulose (generally regarded as safe by the FDA), which will act as a slow release gel without off target toxicity, and an automated injector to control delivery of ethanol-ethyl cellulose (EEC) into the region of interest. The goal of this Phase I SBIR grant is to establish controlled delivery of EEC for cervical pre-cancer treatment using a combination of tissue surrogates and ex vivo and in vivo models of the swine cervix to induce a zone of necrosis that is consistent with thermocoagulation, a commonly used ablation method. In Aim 1, an automated needle injector will be designed for reproducible EEC delivery in tissue surrogates by maximizing the ratio of distributed to injected volume and minimizing back flow and crack formation. In Aim 2, the automated needle injector will be tested in ex vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution of the agent within the defined region of interest and also to determine the number of injections needed to achieve optimal coverage. In Aim 3, the injector safety and efficacy will be tested in in vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution volume and zone of necrosis caused by EEC. The results from the Phase I SBIR will set the foundation for development of alpha and beta versions of the automated needle injector, quality control assessment and packaging of the EEC injectate, and submission of an IND for EEC to the FDA. The goal of this SBIR is for PIs from academic and small business institutions to work in partnership to develop a technological strategy that will transform treatment of cervical pre-cancer in low-resource communities. The proposed research is significantly relevant to public health, as the developed technologies will contribute to the improvement of cervical cancer prevention, and thus a reduction in the mortality rate of this imminently preventable disease.",Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer,10140866,R43CA257303,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cellulose', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cold Therapy', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Ethanol', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Field Reports', 'Fluorescein', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Needles', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Power Sources', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stains', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Vaccination', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'cervical biopsy', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cost', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'field study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preclinical study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'screening', 'standard of care']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R43,2020,300000,0.082778153
NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia requiring treatment            and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  The ability         to develop and prescribe new treatments for atrial fibrillation depends          on the availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple and               inexpensive enough to support their use for screening large numbers of           patients.                                                                                                                                                         Recent evidence demonstrates that the electrophysiologic state of the            atrium is a primary determinant of both the history of atrial                    fibrillation and its response to therapy. This provides a strong                 rationale for developing techniques for assessing atrial                         electrophysiology during fibrillation.                                                                                                                            The Creare team proposes to develop a noninvasive technique for                  assessing and classifying atrial fibrillation based on the surface               electrocardiogram.  This technique will assist clinicians in determining         treatment strategies for patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION                                                  Creare's technique for noninvasive assessment of atrial fibrillation             will provide the clinician with a powerful new tool for optimizing               patient treatment.

"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone).

"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,0.06646077
"Early Detection of Bladder Cancer Using a Waveguide Array Biosensor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) represents a major health problem throughout the world. It is estimated that in the United States, 73,510 men and women were diagnosed with BC and 14,880 died of the disease in 2012. Often, early diagnosis of cancer enhances survival rates and enables optimal risk assessment. One major problem for the diagnosis of BC is the lack of distinct symptoms associated with the disease, so it is necessary to rely on medical testing. To address this problem, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a Waveguide Array Biosensor (WABS) for early diagnosis of bladder cancer. The WABS system is based on a long period grating (LPG) array built on an integrated optical chip (IOC), which is coated with capture antibodies corresponding to a panel of urinary biomarkers of bladder cancer. WABS is a hybrid construction with an optical chip mounted onto a silicon substrate. The biosensor is fabricated using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The sensor will provide a rapid and accurate assessment of the presence of multiple urinary protein biomarkers of bladder cancer in urine samples. WABS consists of optical waveguides, edge-mounted laser diodes (LDs), and photodetectors (PDs). The optical waveguides, fabricated on a LiNbO3 chip, will be bonded to the silicon on top of strain-relieved posts micromachined onto silicon. We will embed an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm in the electronics, which will significantly increase the accuracy of biomarker detection. The WABS system will be a label-free, one-step, point-of-care screening tool for the early detection of bladder cancer and will provide an attractive alternative to invasive diagnostic methods such as cystoscopy. In Phase I, the WABS system will be designed for optimal sensitivity and limit of detection. The system will be assembled with a microfluidic module for handling very low sample volumes (<10 mL). POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the WABS system by fabricating components, assembling a prototype, and demonstrating its capability for label-free identification and quantitation of multiple BC biomarkers such as NMP22, Lewis X, BTA, UPK3A, and BLCA-4 spiked in artificial urine samples. In Phase II, the WABS system will be expanded to achieve multiplex detection of several cancer biomarkers and tested using clinical samples. The system will also be optimized to offer rapid detection, automatic data analysis, and low manufacturing cost aimed at the potential for mass production. This Phase I study will lead to the development of an instrument that can be used for cancer staging, assessing a patient's response to anticancer therapy, and subsequent monitoring.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed WABS system will offer a very sensitive, inexpensive, one-step, point-of-care screening tool for the early diagnosis of bladder cancer. This system can be used for cancer screening tests, cancer staging, monitoring of disease recurrence, and assessment of a patient's response to anticancer therapy. WABS can be used in hospitals, physicians' offices, clinical settings, laboratories, and households.              ",Early Detection of Bladder Cancer Using a Waveguide Array Biosensor,8713208,R43CA192394,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biosensor', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cytology', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematuria', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Severity of illness', 'Silicon', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'lithium niobate', 'men', 'multiplex detection', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'photonics', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'urinary']",NCI,PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION,R43,2014,149999,0.064761769
"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house.

"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization.

"ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the US. For most patients, the disease is first diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the 5-year survival rate is low (< 30%). Despite incremental improvement in chemotherapy, the cure rate has not improved significantly in the past decades, The dramatic difference in long-term survival between patients with local disease (80-90%) and those with distant metastases (5-20%) suggests the need for a non-invasive, yet effective test applicable to at-risk population groups to detect ovarian cancer in early stages. Building upon prior research in differentiating malignant from benign ovarian masses, this project seeks to apply artificial neural network (ANN) technology to the problem of screening for early-stage ovarian cancer based on a variety of serum markers and other clinical inputs. The recently completed Phase I pilot project validated the feasibility by (1) assembling existing data from collaborating Organizations, (2) analyzing the predictive value of relevant biomarkers, (3) developing a preliminary ANN, and (4) validating the ANN using independent test data. The successful completion of Phase I now facilitates the commencement of Phase II activities to develop a production version of the screening system and to initiate broad-scale validation through multiple clinical studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ANN software capable of detecting early-stage ovarian cancer with sufficient improvement in specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value over alternative techniques would have clear commercial value in screening high-risk populations. Horns presently offers as a commercial product an Internet-based clinical information processing service, called ProstAsure, developed using ANN technology, for the detection of prostate cancer.  n/a",ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER,6211886,R44CA080459,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' ovary neoplasms']",NCI,"HORUS GLOBAL HEALTHNET, INC.",R44,2000,585610,0.051093634
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images.

"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields.

"Rational Design of High-Affinity Peptide Drug Candidates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The R&D of new drugs is a protracted and expensive process. The typical drug discovery process evolves from target identification to preclinical development and marketing. Several studies estimate the average cost of development of a single new drug in excess of $800 million. A large portion of this expense is attributed to abandoned lead candidates initially obtained from screening vast random combinatorial libraries of compounds for activity against the target but which fail for various reasons. Recent vast strides in the unraveling of the human interactive have allowed the mapping of a large numbers of protein-protein interactions, several of which are key to the pathology of disease. The identification of modulators of protein function and the process of transforming these into high-content lead series are key activities in modern drug discovery. A rapid methodology to identify high-affinity peptide drug candidates able to modulate key protein interactions, and having high potential for success as drug leads, will have huge benefits. Short high-affinity peptide ligands are highly desirable drug candidates because they are robust, easily synthesized in large quantities, and readily purified. Several short peptides have demonstrated significant ability to modulate protein-protein interactions - e.g. octreotide (SSTR2) and RGD peptides (1v23 integrins), and several others have led to the development of highly potent peptidomimetics. In preliminary studies, Lynntech has demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-affinity peptide ligands to target proteins based on their known amino acid sequence alone using a modular approach that combined computational biology and bioinformatics tools with a unique, advanced, high-density peptide microarray for high throughput screening of candidate ligands. Several high-affinity peptide ligands (20-30 nM affinity) were obtained after a single array screening, with the potential to refine the affinity further using iterative arrays. The methodology used conveys itself readily for automation. This study proposes the creation of a new bioinformatics engine for High-Affinity Ligand Optimization (HALO) that will enable the rapid, automated, and customized generation, screening, and identification of high affinity peptide ligands to any protein-protein interaction integral to disease pathology. HALO is a highly potent tool that will be useful for rapid hit-to-lead peptide drug candidate generation and is expected to revolutionize and expedite the process of drug discovery.            PROJECT NARRATIVE The high cost of drug discovery can be mitigated by a rapid and reliable method of creating valid lead drug candidates for further refinement of drug like properties. Lynntech's proposed bioinformatics engine incorporates advanced datamining methods along with a high-throughput peptide microarray technology that can be used to customize, array, and screen several thousands of peptide ligand candidates for their affinity to key proteins involved in disease-related pathways. These high-affinity ligands will serves as useful hit-to-lead candidates for more economical drug development.",Rational Design of High-Affinity Peptide Drug Candidates,7671034,R41GM087803,"['ANXA5 gene', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Annexin A1', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Integrins', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Octreotide', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Deregulation', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RGD (sequence)', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'SSTR2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Homology', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectrin', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'annexin A5', 'base', 'cell growth', 'combinatorial', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'density', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lead series', 'migration', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'optimism', 'peptidomimetics', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein function', 'protein phosphatase inhibitor-2', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'stereochemistry', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R41,2009,277479,0.050523538
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test.

This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.            ",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8714587,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2014,796039,0.048051368
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9507401,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'base', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2018,86000,0.048013858

"ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION O Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the US. For most patients, the disease is first diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the 5-year survival rate is low (<30%). Despite incremental improvement in chemotherapy, the cure rate has not improved significantly in the past decades. The dramatic difference in long-term survival between patients with local disease (80-90%) and those with distant metastases (5- 20%) suggests the need for a non-invasive, yet effective test applicable to at-risk population groups to detect ovarian cancer in early stages. Building upon prior research in differentiating malignant from benign ovarian masses, this project seeks to apply artificial neural network (ANN) technology to the problem of screening for early-stage ovarian cancer based a variety of serum markers and other clinical inputs. Phase I will constitute a pilot project that assesses feasibility by (l) assembling existing data from collaborating organizations, (2) analyzing the predictive value of relevant biomarkers, (3) developing a preliminary ANN, and (4) validating the ANN using independent test data. If successful in Phase I, Phase II activities will be proposed to develop a production version of the screening system and initiate broad-scale validation through multiple clinical studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ANN software capable of detecting early-stage ovarian cancer with sufficient improvement in specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value over alternative techniques would have clear commercial value in screening high-risk populations. Horus presently offers as a commercial product an Internet based clinical information processing service, called ProstAsure, developed using ANN technology, for the detection of prostate cancer.  n/a",ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION O,2784815,R43CA080459,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' ovary neoplasms']",NCI,"HORUS GLOBAL HEALTHNET, INC.",R43,1999,93401,0.047896967
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors. The proposed tools will also enable quick turnaround time for screening, thus further helping prevent blindness due to diabetes complications.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8466969,R43EB013585,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Awareness', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'County', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Dictionary', 'Disadvantaged', 'Economic Factors', 'Ensure', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Lesion', 'Localized Lesion', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Microaneurysm', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometry', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Computing', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cotton wool spots', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'image processing', 'neovascularization', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2013,199466,0.041936158
"ICON-BASED COURSEWARE FOR ALCOHOLISM ASSESSMENT TRAINING The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has identified the need for education materials which facilitate the training of health professionals and paraprofessionals in the use of various alcoholism assessment techniques and instruments. In response to this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia (ARCOVA) proposes the development of icon-based courseware for alcoholism appraisal training and instruction. Specific aims of the research include selection of alcoholism assessment methodologies which are practical screening instruments in medical settings, development of effective presentation strategies for a diverse target audience, integration of the presentation strategies with an icon-based graphical user interface, implementation of a database management system and expert system director for system control, and formative evaluation of system effectiveness. Successful completion of these research aims will result in a user-friendly alcoholism screening training tool for physicians, nurses and psychologists. The significance of this effort is the innovative use of computer-assisted instruction techniques for development of an alcoholism appraisal learning environment. Since computer-based training has been shown to be more effective than other media of instruction (human interaction, text, audio- visual), ARCOVA will demonstrate a proof-of-concept system for alcoholism assessment education which is superior to present methods.  n/a",ICON-BASED COURSEWARE FOR ALCOHOLISM ASSESSMENT TRAINING,3487410,R43AA009572,"['alcoholism /alcohol abuse', ' alcoholism /alcohol abuse education', ' artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health care personnel education', ' human subject', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' physicians', ' training aid']",NIAAA,AMERICAN RESEARCH CORP OF VIRGINIA,R43,1993,50000,0.032997836
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines.

"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,0.030491511
"Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones PROJECT SUMMARY Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries; many of its complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home. PROJECT NARRATIVE Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries affecting over 1.23 billion people in 2013 and can lead to complications such as hearing loss, developmental delay, meningitis, mastoiditis, and death. Many of these complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. However, the absence of an accurate and accessible method to detect middle ear fluid has led to high misdiagnosis rates. The consequence is associated hearing and speech impairment rates greater than any other pediatric condition and growing microbial resistance as a result of antibiotic over-prescription. Currently, the technique of choice for detecting middle ear fluid by primary care providers is visual otoscopy, which has a diagnostic accuracy as low as 51%. Although more accurate methods like tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy exist, they require significant expertise and referral to a specialist. Commercial acoustic reflectometers and smartphone-mounted otoscopes require specialized hardware. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for an accurate, rapid and easily accessible method for resource-limited healthcare providers and caregivers to detect middle ear fluid. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using the speakers and microphones on existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. Our proposed system would operate by (i) sending a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detecting reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employing a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status. No additional attachments would be required beyond a paper funnel, which acts as a speculum to reduce waveform variability and can be constructed with printer paper, scissors, and tape. This technique is the first software-based screening tool for middle ear fluid detection that uses off-the-shelf smartphones which does not require hardware attachments or visual interpretation. Using data from our existing preliminary clinical study we aim to develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to optimize sensitivity and specificity. We plan to develop a bench testing technique that enables previously unsupported smartphones to to run our test and prospectively validate our optimized algorithm clinically in parallel testing with an acoustic reflectometer. Further we aim to develop a user interface and improved funnel design. These new designs will undergo usability testing in physician and parent populations.

"Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis Abstract  In this SBIR project, we propose EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated retinal im- age capture and analysis system, comprising a self-driven, robotic fundus camera plat- form for automated image capture and a deep learning-based image analysis engine for generation of automated screening outcome. With the large, growing, and aging popula- tion and the increased prevalence of diabetes, a large number of people are at risk for vision loss due to several eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Although eye screening is effective in re- ducing vision loss, there are not enough clinical personnel and eye-care experts for pop- ulation-wide eye screening. Recent advances with automated image analysis are helping alleviate the situation, but they are still limited by the need for good quality images of the patients captured by trained technicians or expensive retinal cameras equipped for auto- mated capture. EyeScreenBot will be developed to provide a truly end-to-end screening solution that is cost-effective and suitable for deployment in primary care clinics or op- tometrist sites, addressing both automated capture and subsequent automated analysis, all without the need for trained technicians or eye experts at the point of care. When deployed and commercialized, this device will rapidly aid scaling of eye screening for the masses, thereby having an enormous impact in improving the quality and accessibility of eye care and helping reduce preventable vision loss. Narrative EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated screening system with intelligent image capture and analysis, will truly enable eye screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent since the population at risk for preventable vision loss due to retinal diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) is growing at a staggering rate. Triaging and identification of at-risk patients will allow for timely intervention to prevent, slow, or even reverse the disease progression and loss of vision.",Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis,9847891,R43EY029652,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'aging population', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'retinal imaging', 'robot interface', 'robotic system', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2019,218618,0.02931619
"Microarrays of Intermediate Endpoints of Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection causes gastric adenocarcinoma, the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Screening and treatment of H. pylori could be a cost-effective way of preventing cancer, but whether H. pylori eradication can stop progression of gastric carcinogenesis remains unknown. Several studies have been completed that indicate incomplete regression of gastric preneoplastic conditions with H. pylori eradication. Using preneoplastic conditions as surrogate markers, however, is problematic in that regressions of surrogates may not signify regressions in cancer risk. To know the meaning of microscopic regression, one must look at the molecular underpinnings of the observed phenotypic changes.      We hypothesize that the histologic regression observed with H. pylori eradication reflects molecular changes. To determine if this is the case we will dissect the role that H. pylori plays in molecular pathways of gastric preneoplasia. cDNA microarray will be used to assess gene expression profiles of archived tissues from a randomized placebo-control trial of H. pylori eradication conducted in Mexico. A total of 90 subjects (45 from the treatment arm and 45 from the placebo arm) with preneoplastic conditions (gastritis, atrophy, and metaplasia) will be selected from the original trial. For each of the 90 subjects, a pair of pre- and post-treatment gastric tissues will be used for cDNA microarray. The resulting gene expression data will be analyzed by hierarchical clustering and Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). In addition to the data on patients with preneoplastic lesions, we also have access to gene expression profiles of 90 gastric cancer tissues and 22 normal gastric tissues from investigators at our institution. Our data can then bridge the gap between different carcinogenetic stages between normal and cancer. In summary, the primary aims of this study are: 1) to assess the changes of global gene expression patterns associated with H. pylori eradication and identify reversible, molecular ""intermediate biomarkers"" for gastric cancer, 2) to compare the results from gene expression studies to those from pathologic diagnoses, and 3) to compare the results from gene expression studies in normal, preneoplastic, and malignant tissues.      This proposed study will not only help elucidate the poorly understood molecular mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis, but also help delineate the role of H. pylori infection in this process. Despite National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines to the contrary, H. pylori screening and eradication therapy is being widely used by primary care practitioners in the hope that it will prevent cancer in high-risk populations.

"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10033377,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542483,0.024995674
"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,0.023848799
"RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening Project Summary Over the past two decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of adult blindness in the US, affecting 40% of all diabetic patients and resulting in $500 million a year in direct medical costs. Vision loss due to DR is largely preventable and can be reduced by up to 90% with appropriate eye screening. However, in the US, less than 50% of diabetic patients receive a recommended yearly eye exam due to many factors that include lack of access to eye care professionals. Distributed tele-ophthalmic screening thru primary care clinics can potentially provide all diabetic patients cost- effective, yearly evaluations to detect DR and prevent vision loss. However, gold-standard sensitive detection of DR using standard retinal photography is complex and cumbersome process requiring up to 7 images per eye. This screening process cannot for all practical purposes be achieved without having highly trained ophthalmic photographers. RetiVue proposes to develop the RetiVue DR in collaboration with Olympus, to create the first handheld, non- mydriatic, 160 field of view, widefield DR screening camera. It will allow single photo capture of an area up to ten times greater than conventional fundus cameras, allowing sensitive detection of DR at its earliest time points. Full integration of RetiVue and Olympus hardware will enable the most advanced and highest image quality handheld retina camera on the market. Use of automated alignment, auto laser focus, and auto image capture will allow complex imaging of the retina to be performed simply by positioning the iris, requiring no user knowledge of retinal anatomy. We have established clinical proof of concept with our patented technology, but require several additional innovations in optical design, automated image recognition, and retinal image processing to enable a commercial device. We will for this proposal optimize our alignment system and laser based focusing system for widefield imaging, allowing automated alignment and focus to image the retina before eye movement occurs. We will develop a new method of widefield, non-mydriatic peripheral retinal imaging using multiple LED slit-beam projectors to allow rapid, segmental, sequential image capture of 90°, 120°, and 160° FOV on diabetic patients. Finally, we will create the most advanced retinal image processing algorithms to remove Purkinje haze which prevents conventional cameras from imaging beyond 45° FOV and enable seamless stitching of segmental peripheral retina images into a single widefield image. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a blinding eye disease that affects millions of people with diabetes and costs the US $500 million a year in medical costs. Loss of vision can be prevented if diabetic patients undergo yearly eye screening that examines the retina to detect this disease, but currently less than 50% of diabetics do so. At Re- tiVue LLC, we are designing the first easy to use handheld eye camera to allow primary care doctors to take DSLR quality pictures of the eye to look for diabetic retinopathy. Our eye camera will see 5 times more of the retina than any other handheld camera, ensuring that we find diabetic retinopathy when it first occurs. Earlier detection of diabetic retinopathy will give diabetic patients the best chance to keep their vision long term, and avoid unnecessary blindness.","RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening",9564677,R44EY028484,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNFRSF10B gene', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'lens', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'sensor', 'success']",NEI,RETIVUE,R44,2018,847697,0.023052539
"SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer affecting the retina, optic nerve, and brain. Accounting for 6% of all cancers in children under the age of five, it is the world's most common primary intraocular childhood malignancy. While survival rates in the U.S. are high, early detection is pivotal to preserving vision: by the time symptoms present, enucleation is often the only option. This proposal seeks to develop IRIS-R, an Intelligent Retinal Imaging Solution to enable earlier detection of Retinoblastoma. This inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool will leverage recent advances in deep learning to detect the tell-tale signs of retinal tumors in near real-time. The models will be integrated with a handheld non-mydriatic fundus imager, providing a reliable, inexpensive, hardware backbone for the screening tool. IRIS-R will be developed with help from retinal specialists, practicing ophthalmologists, and pediatricians to guarantee maximum diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness. n/a","SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269835,5N91020C00047,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fundus', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Nerve', 'Phase', 'Retina', 'Retinal Neoplasms', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fundus imaging', 'imager', 'pediatrician', 'preservation', 'retinal imaging']",NCI,BABEL ANALYTICS LLC,N43,2020,398149,0.020657714
"Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to enable accurate acquisition of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements in relatively high noise environments for use in hearing evaluations and screening. DPOAE measurements have been shown to be an effective and efficient method for screening infant, children, and adult hearing. Environmental noise, however, has been shown to adversely affect the ability to successfully obtain DPOAE measurements, especially at frequencies below 1500 Hz.  We will achieve our aim by developing a narrow-band, adaptive active noise reduction system that will seamlessly augment existing DPOAE measurement protocols. Our innovation will supplement existing DPOAE measurement systems with both low-cost acoustic hardware and advanced signal processing techniques. By reducing background noise levels in a narrow frequency band near the DPOAE test frequencies, we will enable higher signal-to-noise ratio DPOAE measurement sequences. The increased SNR will result in the ability to obtain DPOAE measurements in relatively high noise environments such as the newborn intensive care unit and nursery, offices of pediatricians, schools without special audiology facilities, field hospitals, and remote or mobile clinics. n/a",Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement,6485483,R43DC005112,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' hearing tests', ' human subject', ' measurement', ' noise', ' otoacoustic emission', ' sound frequency']",NIDCD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2002,103954,0.018388447
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,9989245,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.01528846
"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix.

"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As a result, genetic counseling and testing is increasingly recommended for AYAs with new cancer diagnoses so that screening for new cancers can take place; however, no AYA-specific models for cancer risk communication and decision-making have been developed. The proposed study will develop and test a novel, patient- and family-centered model for cancer risk communication and decision-making to meet the unique needs of AYAs.",The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes,9848695,U01CA243688,"['Access to Information', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Attention', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychology', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Counseling', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Screening for cancer', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'chatbot', 'child bearing', 'computer program', 'design', 'education resources', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient portal', 'programs', 'psychological distress', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2019,3543148,0.009977423
"Finding combinatorial drug repositioning therapy for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias PROJECT SUMMARY AD/ADRD are highly complex diseases characterized by distinct molecular pathways and neuropathological phenotypes. Unfortunately, the treatment remains at best modestly effective and no new drugs have been approved since 2003. Combinatorial drug therapy for AD/ADRD treatment has not been intensively studied but it is highly promising. We hypothesize that finding repositioned drug combinations through innovative exploration of big data may uncover effective AD/ADRD treatments, with implicit advantages in overcoming drug resistance and targeting multiple biomarkers. We will combine big biomedical data from complementary sources, novel and advanced informatics models, clinical domain expertise, as well as biology knowledge and validation into a coherent framework to tackle AD/ADRD with potential combinatorial drug therapies. In an exponentially larger and more challenging space of combinatorial drug therapy, opportunities are also exponentially larger when compared with traditional single-drug models but many computational challenges need to be carefully handled. We will develop multiple computational models under two philosophical umbrellas, with focuses on quantifiable screening and biological understanding. Our findings will be validated with biological experiments from cell to mouse. If successful, we will significantly advance AD/ADRD research and benefit patients with safe and effective treatment. NARRATIVE The project aims at identifying novel drug combination therapies for AD/ADRD prevention and treatment using advanced informatics methods. We propose multiple strategies focusing on quantifiable screening and biological understanding using large healthcare databases and biology/pharmacogenomics knowledgebases.

"Development of a human hepatocyte predictive pharmacology and toxicology system.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug efficacy and toxicity screening and testing through the development of human hepatocyte (liver) in vitro culture systems that more effectively mimic the human in vivo environment. HemoShear is a biotechnology research company that utilizes patented methodologies to restore in vivo responsiveness to human primary cells in vitro. Under Phase I SBIR R43DK091104, we developed a predictive rat primary hepatocyte system that restores morphology, function, transport, metabolism and respond to drugs and growth factors at nearer to in vivo levels. The principles to develop the rat system, translated to human primary hepatocytes, restoring morphology, function, metabolism and drug response at in vivo drug levels achieved in humans. To our knowledge, there are no commercially available systems that can achieve this level of hepatobiology and in vivo responsiveness in human primary hepatocytes ex vivo. The purpose of Phase II SBIR R44DK091104 is to further develop and validate a predictive primary human hepatocyte system for use in investigative toxicology, safety assessment and drug discovery with our commercial partners.

"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening in Non-Adherent Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S. about 23 million women aged 50-74 are overdue for recommended biennial screening mammography. Repeated annual screening is considered optimal by some experts and even more women would be overdue by this standard. The reduction in breast cancer mortality expected from screening mammography requires repeated mammogram use, so women who do not have a mammogram every 1-2 years are at risk for developing advanced stage or incurable breast cancers. NHIS 2005 data show a significant drop in mammograms gotten in the prior 24 months. Between 2000 and 2005, rates dropped for women aged 50-64 from 78.6 to 71.8% and for those >65, from 68 to 63.8%. Those most affected had higher incomes, private insurance and a usual source of care. Despite strong evidence that mail and telephone outreach to women can increase mammography rates, few health care delivery organizations have adopted comprehensive outreach programs, especially ones including a telephone component. Reasons for this include: 1) uncertainty about the optimum outreach strategy and long-term effectiveness; 2) absence of feasible, replicable models for use in large organizations; and 3) cost and cost-effectiveness data to guide the decisions on implementation. To address these concerns this study aims to identify the most effective and cost effective of the outreach strategies that studies have been shown to be effective or promising. We propose to randomize all women age 51-84 enrolled in a large group model HMO (n=23,000) to 1 of 3 intervention arms. We will continue to enroll new HMO members and to deliver the interventions over a 4-year period to assess long-term outcomes. The interventions are: 1) a reminder letter only (RL) (usual care for this HMO); 2) a reminder letter followed by a reminder phone call to nonresponders (RL-RC) that includes an opportunity to schedule a mammogram; and 3) a reminder letter followed by an enhanced, tailored telephone counseling (ETTC) to nonresponders (RL-ETTC) that includes motivational interviewing, barrier-specific counseling, and an opportunity to schedule a mammogram. Our aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the 3 interventions in increasing adherence to screening mammography guidelines (mammogram every 1-2 years) each year for 4 years; 2) Identify ways to improve the efficiency and sequencing of the interventions by identifying patient factors and intervention mechanisms associated with increased intervention effectiveness; and 3) to determine the incremental cost per unit increase in on-time mammography utilization of the 2 telephone counseling arms compared to the mailed reminder only intervention. We hypothesize that ETTC intervention will be associated with a higher prevalence of mammography within 24 months than the brief telephone reminder intervention, and both telephone interventions will be more effective than the mailed reminder alone for each for the 4 intervention years and that the effectiveness of the intensive telephone intervention will increase each year due to the cumulative effect of the education and motivation it provides. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research has shown that mailing reminders and calling women who are due for a screening mammogram can increase the chances that these women will get a mammogram. Research is needed to identify the most effective and cost-effective type of telephone intervention before widespread adoption of reminder and counseling systems can occur.

"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening in Non-Adherent Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S. about 23 million women aged 50-74 are overdue for recommended biennial screening mammography. Repeated annual screening is considered optimal by some experts and even more women would be overdue by this standard. The reduction in breast cancer mortality expected from screening mammography requires repeated mammogram use, so women who do not have a mammogram every 1-2 years are at risk for developing advanced stage or incurable breast cancers. NHIS 2005 data show a significant drop in mammograms gotten in the prior 24 months. Between 2000 and 2005, rates dropped for women aged 50-64 from 78.6 to 71.8% and for those >65, from 68 to 63.8%. Those most affected had higher incomes, private insurance and a usual source of care. Despite strong evidence that mail and telephone outreach to women can increase mammography rates, few health care delivery organizations have adopted comprehensive outreach programs, especially ones including a telephone component. Reasons for this include: 1) uncertainty about the optimum outreach strategy and long-term effectiveness; 2) absence of feasible, replicable models for use in large organizations; and 3) cost and cost-effectiveness data to guide the decisions on implementation. To address these concerns this study aims to identify the most effective and cost effective of the outreach strategies that studies have been shown to be effective or promising. We propose to randomize all women age 51-84 enrolled in a large group model HMO (n=23,000) to 1 of 3 intervention arms. We will continue to enroll new HMO members and to deliver the interventions over a 4-year period to assess long-term outcomes. The interventions are: 1) a reminder letter only (RL) (usual care for this HMO); 2) a reminder letter followed by a reminder phone call to nonresponders (RL-RC) that includes an opportunity to schedule a mammogram; and 3) a reminder letter followed by an enhanced, tailored telephone counseling (ETTC) to nonresponders (RL-ETTC) that includes motivational interviewing, barrier-specific counseling, and an opportunity to schedule a mammogram. Our aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the 3 interventions in increasing adherence to screening mammography guidelines (mammogram every 1-2 years) each year for 4 years; 2) Identify ways to improve the efficiency and sequencing of the interventions by identifying patient factors and intervention mechanisms associated with increased intervention effectiveness; and 3) to determine the incremental cost per unit increase in on-time mammography utilization of the 2 telephone counseling arms compared to the mailed reminder only intervention. We hypothesize that ETTC intervention will be associated with a higher prevalence of mammography within 24 months than the brief telephone reminder intervention, and both telephone interventions will be more effective than the mailed reminder alone for each for the 4 intervention years and that the effectiveness of the intensive telephone intervention will increase each year due to the cumulative effect of the education and motivation it provides.

"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                  Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high.

"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery.

Despite strong evidence that mail and telephone outreach to women can increase mammography rates, few health care delivery organizations have adopted comprehensive outreach programs, especially ones including a telephone component. Reasons for this include: 1) uncertainty about the optimum outreach strategy and long-term effectiveness; 2) absence of feasible, replicable models for use in large organizations; and 3) cost and cost-effectiveness data to guide the decisions on implementation. To address these concerns this study aims to identify the most effective and cost effective of the outreach strategies that studies have been shown to be effective or promising. We propose to randomize all women age 51-84 enrolled in a large group model HMO (n=23,000) to 1 of 3 intervention arms. We will continue to enroll new HMO members and to deliver the interventions over a 4-year period to assess long-term outcomes. The interventions are: 1) a reminder letter only (RL) (usual care for this HMO); 2) a reminder letter followed by a reminder phone call to nonresponders (RL-RC) that includes an opportunity to schedule a mammogram; and 3) a reminder letter followed by an enhanced, tailored telephone counseling (ETTC) to nonresponders (RL-ETTC) that includes motivational interviewing, barrier-specific counseling, and an opportunity to schedule a mammogram. Our aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the 3 interventions in increasing adherence to screening mammography guidelines (mammogram every 1-2 years) each year for 4 years; 2) Identify ways to improve the efficiency and sequencing of the interventions by identifying patient factors and intervention mechanisms associated with increased intervention effectiveness; and 3) to determine the incremental cost per unit increase in on-time mammography utilization of the 2 telephone counseling arms compared to the mailed reminder only intervention. We hypothesize that ETTC intervention will be associated with a higher prevalence of mammography within 24 months than the brief telephone reminder intervention, and both telephone interventions will be more effective than the mailed reminder alone for each for the 4 intervention years and that the effectiveness of the intensive telephone intervention will increase each year due to the cumulative effect of the education and motivation it provides.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research has shown that mailing reminders and calling women who are due for a screening mammogram can increase the chances that these women will get a mammogram. Research is needed to identify the most effective and cost-effective type of telephone intervention before widespread adoption of reminder and counseling systems can occur. We propose to compare a low intensity and a high intensity reminder/counseling protocol to a mailed reminder alone in a large closed panel HMO. The HMO is committed to incorporating the most study's successful interventions.

"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening.

"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,9885223,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,447500,-0.029249234
"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",9912472,R37CA240403,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Community Practice', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'long short term memory', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2020,547285,-0.052114104
