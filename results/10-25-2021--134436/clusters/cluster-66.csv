"Integrated SNP, gene expression and proteomic analysis This project will see development of a software suite (Genetrix) comprised of tools for data management, visualization, machine learning, statistical analysis and biologic interpretation of data from the large-scale biological platforms (gene expression, SNP and proteomics), in conjunction with ancillary clinical, demographic, epidemiological, laboratory and outcome data.

"Population Genetic Inferences From Dense Genotype Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The shift in attention toward rare alleles and the concomitant need for DNA sequence data from large samples drawn from human populations has driven the need to accurately describe the patterns of human DNA sequence variation and to understand the forces that impact it. At the same time, SNP genotyping platforms are expanding in SNP density at the same time unprecedented sample sizes are accumulating from GWAS studies. In order to foster rigorous inferences about human variation and past human evolution from these data, we propose a series of investigations that center around four aims. First, we will develop novel statistical methods for population genetic inference from next-generation DNA sequence data. Starting from alignments of sequence reads from multiple individuals, we will develop methods of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing that integrate over likelihoods of genotypes conditional on the data. Optimal balance of sample size vs. sequencing coverage will be analyzed for several distinct experimental problems. The methods will be thoroughly tested and applied to several resequencing data sets to which we have access. Second, we will develop and extend methods for ancestry inference from SNP and genome sequence data of admixed individuals and employ them to infer past demographic history, including migration. Our method of ancestry inference based on Principal Components Analysis will be extended to accommodate data uncertainty and ascertainment bias. We will model a range of admixture scenarios from single-pulse to continuous influx in order to determine whether genetic data allows more refined inference of the past history of mixing of two ancestral populations. Third, we will develop methods for estimation of joint IBD relationships across multiple individuals. Existing methods take discrete genotype calls as a starting point, and do not accommodate platform-specific error. There is significant need to develop methods for inference of shared IBD regions genome-wide across multiple individuals in large population samples. Through a combination of heuristic approaches and graph- theory based computational algorithms, we will develop and test such methods. Finally, we will use IBD sharing inferred across individuals in a sample to estimate population genetic parameters in models of demography and selection. Just as demographic changes impact the site frequency spectrum of SNPs, so too will they impact the pattern of IBD sharing in a sample. Turning this problem around, we will develop approaches for inference of population genetic parameters, such as demography, rates of inbreeding, levels of purifying and positive selection, admixture and migration based only on the patterns of IBD sharing. These will be contrasted to approaches that use phased haplotype information for demography inference.           This project aims to understand the population-level forces at play on the human genome by analysis of genome-wide SNP data and next-generation sequences using newly developed statistical methods. Estimation of model parameters from alignments of next-generation sequence reads will be done so as to accommodate base-calling uncertainty, and segment-wise inference of ancestry in admixed genomes will be applied to understand past admixture history. Identity-by-descent methods will be pursued to allow the most reliable inferences about demography, natural selection and other population forces acting on human genetic variation.

"Methods for Genome-wide Association Studies in Admixed Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common genetic variants contributing to disease risk. However, nearly all of these studies have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. It is important to include other populations, because GWAS in Europeans are unlikely to detect risk variants that are common only in non-European populations. In the United States, the majority of individuals of non-European ancestry belong to admixed populations (e.g. African Americans or Latinos) that inherit ancestry from more than one continental population. Existing GWAS methods for admixed populations are inadequate, because they do not incorporate both SNP association and admixture association signals. Thus, if existing methods are applied, analyses will not be fully powered and important variants will be missed. For diseases with known population differences-such as cardiovascular disease in African Americans and asthma in Latinos-the need to develop methods that combine these signals is particularly pressing, because admixture association signals are likely to be particularly important. Here, we propose to develop a complete set of methods and software to combine SNP and admixture association signals in GWAS in admixed populations, while addressing questions such as imputation and choosing SNPs for replication. Our goal is to make fully powered association studies in populations of mixed ancestry as practical as studies in populations of homogeneous ancestry. In addition to African Americans, we will also develop methods for complex admixed populations (e.g. Latinos) that inherit ancestry from three or more continental populations, and for related individuals from admixed populations. Our methods research will be driven by empirical data, including over 10,000 African American samples and 2,400 Latino samples that will be genome-scanned by the CARe consortium, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Our work will be applicable not only to GWAS in admixed populations, but also to meta-analyses of European and admixed populations, as well as future resequencing-based studies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), an approach in which the genomes of both diseased and healthy individuals are scanned to identify genes affecting disease risk, have thus far been primarily restricted to populations of European ancestry. It is important to extend these studies to other populations, such as admixed populations (African Americans and Latinos) that inherit ancestry from multiple continental groups, but existing statistical methods for conducting GWAS in admixed populations are inadequate due to the complexities posed by chromosomal segments of distinct continental ancestry.

"Methods for Genome-wide Association Studies in Admixed Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common genetic variants contributing to disease risk. However, nearly all of these studies have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. It is important to include other populations, because GWAS in Europeans are unlikely to detect risk variants that are common only in non-European populations. In the United States, the majority of individuals of non-European ancestry belong to admixed populations (e.g. African Americans or Latinos) that inherit ancestry from more than one continental population. Existing GWAS methods for admixed populations are inadequate, because they do not incorporate both SNP association and admixture association signals. Thus, if existing methods are applied, analyses will not be fully powered and important variants will be missed. For diseases with known population differences-such as cardiovascular disease in African Americans and asthma in Latinos-the need to develop methods that combine these signals is particularly pressing, because admixture association signals are likely to be particularly important. Here, we propose to develop a complete set of methods and software to combine SNP and admixture association signals in GWAS in admixed populations, while addressing questions such as imputation and choosing SNPs for replication. Our goal is to make fully powered association studies in populations of mixed ancestry as practical as studies in populations of homogeneous ancestry. In addition to African Americans, we will also develop methods for complex admixed populations (e.g. Latinos) that inherit ancestry from three or more continental populations, and for related individuals from admixed populations. Our methods research will be driven by empirical data, including over 10,000 African American samples and 2,400 Latino samples that will be genome-scanned by the CARe consortium, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multiethnic Cohort Study.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases. Our integrated software system MAVEN will facilitate management, analysis, visualization and results sharing of GWA data using cut- ting edge technologies.

With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7485154,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,304625,0.22931706028010054

Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7143682,R01LM009012,"['bladder neoplasm', 'clinical research', 'gene environment interaction', 'genes', 'genetics', 'genome', 'learning', 'model', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2006,319800,0.22931706028010054
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team.

"Molecular Epidemiology of DNA Repair in Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION: Although smoking and alcohol use are major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), only a fraction of smokers develops SCCHN, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility. We have found an association between increasing risk of SCCHN and suboptimal DNA repair capacity (DRC) that may be determined by adverse genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) genes. Therefore, we propose to focus in depth on the NER pathway by expanding from previously studied 5 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) to 85 common tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the well-defined 8 core NER genes (i.e., ERCC1, XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, and XPG), to correlate the variant alleles/genotypes or haplotypes/diplotypes with three NER phenotypes (i.e., NER mRNA expression, NER protein expression and NER DRC), and to evaluate their associations with risk of SCCHN. To accomplish these goals, we will include 1,600 SCCHN cases and 1,600 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls that consist of previously recruited 800 cases and 800 controls and an additional 800 cases and 800 controls to be recruited in this application using the same study design, selection criteria, and data collection instruments. To perform a comprehensive analysis of NER in SCCHN, our specific aims are: AIM 1: To determine the associations of the frequencies of variant alleles/haplotypes and genotypes/diplotypes of tSNPs in the 8 NER genes and the DRC phenotype with risk of SCCHN in 1,600 SCCHN cases and 1,600 controls. We will test the hypotheses that adverse alleles/haplotypes or genotypes/diplotypes of these selected genes and suboptimal DRC phenotype are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. AIM 2: To determine mRNA and protein expression levels of the 8 NER proteins by real-time RT-PCT assay and high-throughput reverse-phase protein lysate microarray assay, respectively, in cultured lymphocytes from 400 cases and 400 controls to be accrued. We will test the hypothesis that lower levels of NER mRNA and protein expression are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. AIM 3: To determine functional relevance of selected variant alleles and haplotypes of tSNPs of the 8 NER genes by correlating the frequencies of variant alleles/ haplotypes and genotypes/diplotypes with expression levels of mRNA and proteins of the 8 NER genes and DRC phenotype. This study will allow us to develop risk assessment models that integrate all biomarkers tested and epidemiological covariates. The relatively large sample size in this renewal allows for stratification analysis by tumor sites (i.e., oral cavity, pharynx and larynx), various genotypes/diplotypes and their combined genotypes, and epidemiologic covariates as well as for assessment of possible gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. This study will contribute to our understanding of the role of NER in the etiology of SCCHN and may lead to possible targets for primary prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: This proposed study is to investigate the roles of genetic factors of DNA repair capacity (DRC), as well as their interactions with tobacco and alcohol use, in the etiology of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx (SCCHN), expanding our preliminary findings to a role of DRC and its genetic determinants (85 single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in 8 DNA repair genes in a large study of 1600 cases and 1600 controls and applying our newly developed assays for mRNA and protein expression to 400 cases and 400 controls. Therefore, this study will help understand correlations between DRC genotypes (SNPs) and phenotypes (expression of mRNA and proteins and DRC) and their roles in the etiology of SCCHN.

"Molecular Epidemiology of DNA Repair in Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION: Although smoking and alcohol use are major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), only a fraction of smokers develops SCCHN, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility. We have found an association between increasing risk of SCCHN and suboptimal DNA repair capacity (DRC) that may be determined by adverse genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) genes. Therefore, we propose to focus in depth on the NER pathway by expanding from previously studied 5 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) to 85 common tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the well-defined 8 core NER genes (i.e., ERCC1, XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, and XPG), to correlate the variant alleles/genotypes or haplotypes/diplotypes with three NER phenotypes (i.e., NER mRNA expression, NER protein expression and NER DRC), and to evaluate their associations with risk of SCCHN. To accomplish these goals, we will include 1,600 SCCHN cases and 1,600 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls that consist of previously recruited 800 cases and 800 controls and an additional 800 cases and 800 controls to be recruited in this application using the same study design, selection criteria, and data collection instruments. To perform a comprehensive analysis of NER in SCCHN, our specific aims are: AIM 1: To determine the associations of the frequencies of variant alleles/haplotypes and genotypes/diplotypes of tSNPs in the 8 NER genes and the DRC phenotype with risk of SCCHN in 1,600 SCCHN cases and 1,600 controls. We will test the hypotheses that adverse alleles/haplotypes or genotypes/diplotypes of these selected genes and suboptimal DRC phenotype are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. AIM 2: To determine mRNA and protein expression levels of the 8 NER proteins by real-time RT-PCT assay and high-throughput reverse-phase protein lysate microarray assay, respectively, in cultured lymphocytes from 400 cases and 400 controls to be accrued. We will test the hypothesis that lower levels of NER mRNA and protein expression are associated with increased risk of SCCHN. AIM 3: To determine functional relevance of selected variant alleles and haplotypes of tSNPs of the 8 NER genes by correlating the frequencies of variant alleles/ haplotypes and genotypes/diplotypes with expression levels of mRNA and proteins of the 8 NER genes and DRC phenotype. This study will allow us to develop risk assessment models that integrate all biomarkers tested and epidemiological covariates. The relatively large sample size in this renewal allows for stratification analysis by tumor sites (i.e., oral cavity, pharynx and larynx), various genotypes/diplotypes and their combined genotypes, and epidemiologic covariates as well as for assessment of possible gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.

"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain.

"Weighted genome-wide association study of amphetamine sensitivity in humans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individual differences in the acute response to drugs of abuse can influence future drug taking and may thus influence risk for drug abuse and addiction. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetic variation contributes to variability in the acute response to drugs of abuse. Recently developed genetic methodologies make it possible to identify the underlying genetic factors that govern these differences. We have already collected data from a large number of healthy human subjects, using highly controlled laboratory-based procedures to measure the acute subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses to d-amphetamine. We currently have DNA from 318 such subjects, and will have reached our goal of collecting 400 by the projected start date of this proposal. We have already examined a number of candidate genes using a targeted genotyping strategy that focuses on replicating genetic associations identified by other studies. In this proposal we seek to use a less biased genome-wide approach. Specifically, we will genotype these 400 subjects using the Affymetrix 6.0 array to obtain more than 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as information about copy number variants (CNVs). We will approach the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes using a frequentist approach, a modified frequentist approach, and a Bayesian analysis. The first approach will use a standard genome-wide association analysis (GWAS), without any prior hypotheses about which SNPs or CNVs are most likely to be true positives. This approach is risky because our sample is relatively small for such a large number of tests. Nevertheless, the effect size of pharmacogenetic variants may be stronger than for disease traits, so our GWAS may identify genome-wide significant results. Our second approach will consider certain specific subpopulations of SNPs for which we believe there is a strong prior probability of a true positive. We delineate several such subpopulations and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. We will incorporate this information by using a weighted multiple testing procedure that facilitates the input of prior information (Roeder et al., 2006, 2007). This method enhances the power to detect associations at candidate loci with minimal loss in power to detect other associations. Our third approach will utilize Bayesian methods, as implemented in BIMBAM (Guan and Stephens 2008). By approaching this same problem with a different statistical framework we can directly estimate the strength of the evidence that a given marker is associated with response to amphetamine. This approach also allows us to account for specific subpopulations that we believe to be enriched for true positives. Our proposal is designed to leverage the substantial investment that has already been made in collecting and carefully phenotyping these 400 subjects. We are taking advantage of technical advances that have made it relatively inexpensive to obtain very large numbers of genotypes. Our statistical approach has the potential to identify SNPs that may contribute to both acute response, and perhaps also other clinically significant endpoints such as drug abuse and addiction. It combines a number of statistical tools to perform a sophisticated GWAS while accounting for other sources of information. We believe that our approach will maximize the potential to obtain new information from our unique sample.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Abuse of stimulant drugs like cocaine, amphetamine and methamphetamine are major public health problems. We are trying to identify genetic differences that influence differences in the response to d- amphetamine, in healthy young adults. About 70% of volunteers like the effects of amphetamine, but about 30% do not; multiple lines of evidence suggest that some of this variability is due to genetic differences. Studies have shown that people who like the effects of a drug continue taking them and are at increased risk for drug abuse. We hope that by identifying genes that influence drug liking we can predict risk of drug abuse and better understand the biological nature of drug abuse in susceptible and resistant people.           BRIEF NARRATIVE SUMMARY  Abuse of stimulant drugs like cocaine, amphetamine and methamphetamine are major public health problems.

"Genetic Determinants of Visceral Adiposity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although obesity is associated with a variety of chronic health conditions, excess deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is more consistently associated with metabolic abnormalities (diabetes and dyslipidemia) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), even in non-obese older adults. Excess VAT is postulated to underlie clustered metabolic risk factors including dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and high plasma glucose. The overall goal of this project is to identify genetic determinants of visceral adiposity. A staged approach is designed to move from a genome wide association (GWA) study - nested in the Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study - to replication of the most promising SNPs in five similarly-phenotyped (computed tomography (CT)-measured VAT) independent studies. Specifically, the following two aims are proposed. Aim 1: To determine the association between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CT-measured VATamong a total sample of 2,400 subjects from the Health ABC study (1200 randomly selected European Americans (EA) and 1200 African Americans (AA)). The 1200 EAs and1200 AAs will be genotyped using Illumina 550K and 650K chips, respectively. SNPs will be rank-ordered using an algorithm incorporating statistical significance, prior genomic evidence (e.g., linkage studies), and other indicators of priority (e.g., potential functional significance) to identify the most promising 768 VAT-associated SNPs for each ethnic group. Aim 2: To confirm or refute most promising VAT-associated SNPs from Health ABC in five independent replication cohorts using two-stage sequential design. In Stage I, Two cohorts, the Framingham Heart study (FHS, 3329 EAs) and Jackson Heart study (JHS, 4605 AAs), will be used to follow up the promising 768 VAT- associated SNPs for EAs and AAs from Heath ABC, respectively. In stage II, three other cohorts, the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik, 5764 EAs) Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, 787 EAs, 411 AAs A), and the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRAS, 600 AAs), will be used to further validate those SNPs (probably 10-15) replicated in FHS or JHS. In addition, the available GWA studies (e.g. FHS and MESA SHARe and future others) will allow for direct in silico replication and prospective meta-analysis of SNPs captured either directly or through LD (r2e0.8) based on data from the HapMap project. In aggregate, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to discover genes (and their variants) involved in visceral fat accumulation and may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology, prevention and promising therapeutic targets for a number of obesity-related disorders.

"Genetic Determinants of Visceral Adiposity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although obesity is associated with a variety of chronic health conditions, excess deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is more consistently associated with metabolic abnormalities (diabetes and dyslipidemia) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), even in non-obese older adults. Excess VAT is postulated to underlie clustered metabolic risk factors including dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and high plasma glucose. The overall goal of this project is to identify genetic determinants of visceral adiposity. A staged approach is designed to move from a genome wide association (GWA) study - nested in the Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study - to replication of the most promising SNPs in five similarly-phenotyped (computed tomography (CT)-measured VAT) independent studies. Specifically, the following two aims are proposed. Aim 1: To determine the association between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CT-measured VATamong a total sample of 2,400 subjects from the Health ABC study (1200 randomly selected European Americans (EA) and 1200 African Americans (AA)). The 1200 EAs and1200 AAs will be genotyped using Illumina 550K and 650K chips, respectively. SNPs will be rank-ordered using an algorithm incorporating statistical significance, prior genomic evidence (e.g., linkage studies), and other indicators of priority (e.g., potential functional significance) to identify the most promising 768 VAT-associated SNPs for each ethnic group. Aim 2: To confirm or refute most promising VAT-associated SNPs from Health ABC in five independent replication cohorts using two-stage sequential design. In Stage I, Two cohorts, the Framingham Heart study (FHS, 3329 EAs) and Jackson Heart study (JHS, 4605 AAs), will be used to follow up the promising 768 VAT- associated SNPs for EAs and AAs from Heath ABC, respectively. In stage II, three other cohorts, the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik, 5764 EAs) Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, 787 EAs, 411 AAs A), and the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRAS, 600 AAs), will be used to further validate those SNPs (probably 10-15) replicated in FHS or JHS. In addition, the available GWA studies (e.g. FHS and MESA SHARe and future others) will allow for direct in silico replication and prospective meta-analysis of SNPs captured either directly or through LD (r2e0.8) based on data from the HapMap project. In aggregate, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to discover genes (and their variants) involved in visceral fat accumulation and may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology, prevention and promising therapeutic targets for a number of obesity-related disorders.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways.

The two most common subtypes, and the focus of this study, are the oligoarticular and IgM rheumatoid factor negative (RF-) polyarticular forms of JIA. It is hypothesized that there are multiple genetic variants that predispose an individual to JIA and that the subtypes of JIA will differ in at least some of their susceptibility traits. Markers for these traits can be identified by systematically applying high throughput genotyping and copy number technology in a case:control genome-wide association study (GWAS) design. Phase I (GWAS I) genotyping has been completed and includes 1.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or copy number markers for 946 JIA cases and 1000 controls (Affymetrix(R) Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0). Through this challenge grant opportunity, a second GWAS (GWAS-II) is proposed for 1100 additional existing JIA samples available from U.S. investigators of the Consortium on Juvenile Arthritis Genetics (CJAG) and international collaborators in Germany. Phenotypic information includes ILAR classification, age at disease onset, and joint counts. Approximately 1450 out-of-study controls are available through the GAIN study will be used for comparison in association testing for GWAS-II. This additional dataset when combined with existing complementary data from GWAS-I provides an unprecedented opportunity to reveal novel risk factors for JIA and is necessary for advancement of the field. This information may eventually lead to treatments for these disabling diseases and in the long-term contribute to preventing disability. In additional, this opportunity will contribute to a fundamental shift toward molecular definitions and reevaluation of the present criteria for defining subtypes of disease. This research proposal tests the view that juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA, is influenced by many genes conferring susceptibility to and protection from disease. As the genetic basis of the major autoimmune rheumatic disease of childhood becomes evident, eventually the treatment of these disabling diseases will become possible with the long term aim of preventing disability.                  Project Narrative This research proposal tests the view that juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA, is influenced by many genes conferring susceptibility to and protection from disease.

"Genetic Architecture of the Mammalian (Canid) Skeleton More than 200 genetic diseases found in humans also occur in dogs. Innate differences in morphology, as well as serum chemistry and biomarkers are associated with differences in disease incidence between dog breeds. Because so many genetic diseases are found in both dogs and humans and because dogs and humans share the same environments, genetic information obtained from dogs has immediate relevance to human disease. Comparative genomics between DNA sequences of the dog and human genomes facilitates such comparisons.  This research continues a collaboration with the Ostrander laboratory at NIHGR. Building on past results, we will use the dog as a model system to identify genetic loci that regulate: skull and soft tissue morphology, components of serum chemistry (e.g. serum glucose, albumin, globulin, cations and anions etc.) as well as serum biomarkers (e.g. ASR, ALT etc).  Our investigation of skull and soft tissue morphology will use phenotypic data gathered from the autopsy of Portuguese Water (PW) Dogs. Skull data will be compared to radiographs obtained previously. Soft tissue data will include weights and dimensions of components of the respiratory, vascular and digestive systems including brain, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, lungs and components of the digestive tract. In addition weights and/or dimensions of selected muscles and tendons will be obtained. Genotyping will utilize the Affimetrix SNP array that accurately identifies SNP alleles of ~45,000 SNP markers in the PW dog that are well spaced through out the genome. Phenotypes will be associated with SNP markers to identify relevant loci on the PW dog genome. Association analysis will utilize computational techniques previously developed and currently in use in our laboratory. Because of the large LD distance within the PW dog breed, associated loci will be validated in other breeds and haplotypes with reduced LD distance prepared using interbreed comparisons. The genetic basis of morphological regulation will be determined by comparing sequences of segregating haplotypes.  The genetic basis of serum chemistry and biomarkers will utilize a large data base comprising several hundred breeds each of which in turn includes several thousand individual dogs. Breed phenotypes include mean values, as well as effects of aging, sexual dimorphism and the impact of neutering or spaying. Genotyping will utilize Affimetrix SNP microarrays that have been used to characterize allele frequencies in different breeds. By comparing different breed values, haplotypes of less than 500 Kb will be used to determine sequence differences responsible for changes in the breed associated phenotypes. Dogs and humans have several hundred genetic diseases in common, share common environments that may trigger these diseases and utilize similar aspects of serum chemistry and serum biomarkers as diagnostic tools. The availability of more than 200 pure-bred dog breeds, each a genetic isolate with different morphological and physiological characteristics as well as differences in life span and the incidence of specific genetic diseases facilitates the analysis of corresponding genetic diseases found in humans. This study will enhance our understanding of the genetic changes that cause disease and shorten life span as well as improve the interpretation of diagnostic tools used to characterize human genetic disease.",Genetic Architecture of the Mammalian (Canid) Skeleton,7489396,R01GM063056,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Rights', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cephalic', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Control Locus', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Female', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Hip Joint', 'Hominidae', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Litter Size', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Mormon', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pelvis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Range', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Single-Gene Defect', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'Vulpes', 'Water', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'comparative', 'cranium', 'day', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'functional group', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'limb bone', 'male', 'new technology', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sexual dimorphism', 'size', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2008,391525,0.14329202296904042
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Theoretical Population Genetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is concerned with developing new statistical methodology for population genetic data. Attention will be focused on three main areas concerned with dependencies among sets of alleles: the characterization of population structure, the characterization of the association patterns within and between genetic markers and along haplotypes, and the characterization of relatedness and inbreeding for individuals. Theory will be developed at least in part in response to the needs of current large-scale SNP surveys for humans and in anticipation of whole-genome sequence data sets. The work is proposed by a group of investigators in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. They propose to continue collaboration with W.G. Hill at the University of Edinburgh and P.M. Visscher at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. This extended group has interacted successfully over the previous award period, as evidenced by a set of 40 publications. The Beagle approach of S.R. and B.L. Browning will be applied to the detection of tracts of identity by descent. The resulting measures of relationship will be used to refine tests for marker-disease association and to estimate heritability of complex human traits. The population-specific measures of population structure described by B.S. Weir and W.G. Hill will be applied to recently published whole-genome SNP data sets and whole-genome sequence data sets. Methods will be sought to improve methods of drawing inferences about these quantities. Measures of identity by descent and of population structure have the potential to identify regions of the human genome that have been subject to natural selection, and these analyses will be conducted with attention to the large variation and skewness imposed by the evolutionary process. The work of C.C. Laurie and B.S. Weir on detecting chromosomal features, such as inversions, by examining correlations of individual SNPs with principal components derived from large sets of SNPs will be extended. The partial regression approach introduced for QTL mapping will be applied to this problem. Measures of linkage disequilibrium that do not depend on genotypic phase were introduced and have been used previously by these investigators. They will now be extended to the situation of disequilibrium between pairs of loci when several SNPs typed for each gene. Association mapping continues to be of considerable interest to human geneticists and the problem of accounting for (even low level) relatedness will be addressed. Ignoring individuals with at least one relative in a case-control study, for example, can lead to a loss of power. Previous work of Y. Choi and B.S. Weir that modified simple allelic association tests will be extended to the more appropriate logistic regression methods.        As population genetic datasets grow, there is both the need and the opportunity to quantify the dependencies among alleles within and between individuals, or within and between populations. Individual-level dependencies address inbreeding and relatedness and can lead to estimates of heritability of complex human traits. Relatedness estimates can be used to modify tests of association between genetic markers and human diseases. Allelic dependencies at the population level provide characterization of population structure and can be used to infer the presence of natural selection in the history of the populations.

"Genetics of In Vivo and In Vitro Endothelial Function in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral vasculature and endothelial function are impaired in African Americans and likely contribute to their high prevalence of hypertension. Hypertension results from the independent and interactive effects of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Aerobic exercise training (ExTr) corrects endothelial dysfunction by eliciting adaptations in endothelial cells (EC) due to their repeated exposure to elevated vascular shear stress. However, neither the effects of exercise training on endothelial function nor the EC gene expression response to laminar shear stress (LSS), an in vitro model of exercise, are known in African Americans. High physiological levels of LSS, such as those that occur during aerobic exercise, elicit EC gene expression that is consistent with lower blood pressure (BP). Combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in functional genes groups may explain a large portion of the variability in resting BP and in the variability of the changes in BP with ExTr. We will focus on three EC gene functional groups: 1) vasoactive system, 2) oxidant/antioxidant system, and 3) the shear stress signaling system. Hypothesis: functional SNPs, selected apriori and located in genes in the three EC functional groups will contribute to peripheral vascular function and BP at baseline and explain their responses to aerobic exercise training in African American hypertensives, and that these functional SNPs will be related to differential gene expression in human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) obtained from African Americans and exposed to LSS. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine whether functional SNPs within shear stress-regulated genes in the three EC functional groups are associated with changes in shear stress/flow-mediated dilation (FMD), absolute forearm blood flow (FBFA), and changes in casual and 24-hour ambulatory BP with ExTr, 2) Genotype cultured HUVECs obtained from African Americans for the same functional SNPs in Specific Aim 1, expose them to LSS at levels comparable to in vivo levels achieved during aerobic exercise and then perform gene expression profiling and RT-PCR to determine if there are genotype-dependent differences in gene expression, 3) conduct SNP discovery. The application of a standardized perturbation to the peripheral vasculature and ECs, will enable us to detect genetic effects that will provide insights into the molecular biological peripheral vascular mechanisms of hypertension.           n/a",Genetics of In Vivo and In Vitro Endothelial Function in African Americans,8077458,R01HL085497,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Advocate', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin A Receptor', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Forearm', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Oxidants', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stimulus', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Umbilical vein', 'Variant', 'Vascular resistance', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vasomotor', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'clinically significant', 'functional group', 'gene discovery', 'human RGS2 protein', 'human data', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'receptor function', 'research study', 'response', 'shear stress']",NHLBI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2011,637717,0.21036286565302512

"Genetics of In Vivo and In Vitro Endothelial Function in African Americans Peripheral vasculature and endothelial function are impaired in African Americans and likely contribute to their high prevalence of hypertension. Hypertension results from the independent and interactive effects of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Aerobic exercise training (ExTr) corrects endothelial dysfunction by eliciting adaptations in endothelial cells (EC) due to their repeated exposure to elevated vascular shear stress. However, neither the effects of exercise training on endothelial function nor the EC gene expression response to laminar shear stress (LSS), an in vitro model of exercise, are known in African Americans. High physiological levels of LSS, such as those that occur during aerobic exercise, elicit EC gene expression that is consistent with lower blood pressure (BP). Combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in functional genes groups may explain a large portion of the variability in resting BP and in the variability of the changes in BP with ExTr.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.

"Aldosterone, Histone Demethylase and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past 20 years, we have studied the genetic underpinnings of hormonal factors leading to hypertension (HTN) in the HyperPATH cohort. From these studies, we have identified several associations between single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers on candidate genes and specific intermediate phenotypes of the HTN. This proposal will focus on one of these identified phenotype/genotype associations. The intermediate phenotype is derived from the aldosterone (ALDO) response to angiotensin II (ANGII) on a sodium-restricted intake. This phenotype is heritable in the hypertensive population, is bimodally distributed in the hypertensive but not normotensive population and the hypertensive intermediate phenotype consists of those subjects in the lower mode that comprise 25% of hypertensives and <2% of normotensives. Associated with this subset is an enhanced sodium sensitivity of blood pressure and a defect in the vasculature, specifically the renovasculature. The genetic mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear. One candidate is the recently described, first identified, histone demethylase that is linked to and whose action is modified by steroids---lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). A positive association between SNPs in LSD1 and ALDO response to ANGII was only observed in hypertensives and not normotensives. We then extended our studies in two ways: assessing LSD1 SNPs relationship to other phenotypic characteristics in humans (the minor allele also was associated with low urine ALDO levels on a high salt diet and sodium sensitivity of BP) and studying in experimental animals the relationship between LSD1, ALDO, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and vascular injury. Our preliminary data suggest that LSD1: is present in vascular and cardiac tissue; is regulated by NA intake; is decreased by ALDO with the reversal by administering an MR antagonist; and is reduced in a CV injury model with parallel increases in its level and reduction in CV damage with MR blockade. The overall goal of the present proposal is to expand on these preliminary findings by characterizing the mechanisms underlying the interactions between LSD1, ALDO and the vasculature and their involvement in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Three approaches will be used. 1) We will assess phenotypic associations to polymorphism in the LSD1 gene to other genes and in the HyperPATH cohort and in a different cohort. 2) We will define LSD1's role in ALDO secretion. 3) We will extend our mechanistic studies of LSD1 from the adrenal to the vasculature. Thus, these positive results have formed the basis of the present proposal: a translational research project based on preliminary results from both the bench and the clinical research center. We will use in vivo and in vitro studies on vessels and adrenals in both humans (from our HyperPATH cohort) and animals (the LSD1 heterozygote knockout mouse where the LSD1 levels are 50% of that in the wild type). Vascular reactivity of vessels, molecular biologic and cell biologic techniques will be used. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal gland whose function traditionally has been assumed to be to modify the kidney's ability to excrete potassium and sodium.

This project is designed to assess one of those mechanisms thereby providing entr�e to developing more directed therapy to treat cardiovascular diseases.","Aldosterone, Histone Demethylase and Cardiovascular Disease",7737103,R01HL094452,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adrenal Cortex', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Aldosterone', 'Alleles', 'Androgens', 'Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensinogen', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Corticotropin', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deltastab', 'Diet', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enzyme Interaction', 'Enzymes', 'Estrogens', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heterozygote', 'Hispanics', 'Histones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Kidney', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Lysine', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphic Microsatellite Marker', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Sodium', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Steroid Receptors', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'db/db mouse', 'design', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'neutrophil', 'normotensive', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'salt sensitive', 'text searching']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,631481,0.024113252511034022
"Database of Functional SNPs in Cancer-Related Environmentally Responsive Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, there is now a great need for prioritizing potential functional SNPs that are most likely to affect phenotypic functions and ultimately contribute to disease development. This proposal will explore the application of available bioinformatic methods in functional SNP selection by focusing on genes responsible for environmental responses. Validity of these approaches will be assessed by literature search and empirical confirmations. Specifically, the aims of this proposal are: 1) To identify SNPs with potential functional importance in approximately 700 environmentally responsive genes using SNPs collected from public SNP databases and screened by available bioinformatic tools. A functional SNP database will be constructed. 2).To survey previous publications examining SNP functionality and their roles in cancer case-control studies. Results will be integrated with the SNP database. 3) To determine to what extent the predictive value of SNP functionality is mirrored in findings from molecular epidemiologic studies. Since most of these environmentally responsive genes are involved in cancer development, our hypothesis is that SNPs predicted to have significant impact on protein function are more likely to be associated with cancer risk in terms of odds ratios detected in previous case-control studies. Functional SNPs generated from this interdisciplinary approach will become publicly available. Findings from this study will enhance the use of SNPs in future phenotypic studies and molecular epidemiologic approaches to address questions related to gene-environment interaction in disease risk estimate.              n/a",Database of Functional SNPs in Cancer-Related Environmentally Responsive Genes,7569016,R01CA122676,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Structural Protein', 'Surveys', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disorder risk', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lung tumorigenesis', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,303456,0.33219297135417464

"The Genetic Basis of Neuroblastoma Tumorigenesis Neuroblastoma is a common and lethal pediatric malignancy, but the genetic events that initiate tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We hypothesize that neuroblastoma is a complex disease that results from the interaction of mutant alleles with relatively low to moderate effect on tumor initiation. We now plan to discover neuroblastoma susceptibility genes by performing a definitive whole genome association study in ~5000 neuroblastoma patients from the Children's Oncology Group using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based replicative study design. We will compare our cases to two control sets: both pediatric non-cancer patients accessioned from our institution, and adult control subjects matched by region across the country. We propose four Specific Aims: First, we will perform a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with SNPs and SNP haplotypes in 2000 neuroblastoma cases and an equal number of matched controls (both children and adults in parallel analyses). Over 550K SNPs will be surveyed, and we anticipate identifying 25,000-50,000 candidate SNPs for further evaluation. Second, we will identify true disease-associated SNP alleles using a customized genotyping platform enriched for haplotype analyses in an independent set of 2000 cases and again two large control sets. By leveraging the HapMap project and controlling for population substructure, we anticipate that this Aim will identify 10-20 genomic regions as candidates for association with neuroblastoma. Third, we will validate at least 5-10 disease-associated regions in a final independent sample set of 675 cases and two sets of ~675 controls. We will again use a gene-centric haplotyping approach to determine true disease associated variants and candidate genes. Finally, we will definitively identify neuroblastoma predisposition genes through direct resequencing of candidate regions in a carefully selected set of 100 neuroblastoma cases and 100 controls, each equally proportioned between the presence or absence of the SNP/haplotype variant associated with neuroblastoma. Our large panel of tumor reagents and genomics databases will be leveraged to assist in region prioritization and identification of candidate genes for further analysis. The successful completion of this project will provide insight into the underlying genetic etiology of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. We ultimately plan to translate the discovered neuroblastoma predisposition genes into a prognostic biomarkers and/or a target for new treatment approaches. In addition, the data generated here will rapidly be made available to any academically qualified petitioner interested in associating the SNP genotypes with the robust phenotypic information that we have captured including clinical characteristics, tumor biology, response to therapy and disease outcome. Finally, this project should also help catalyze the field of childhood cancer applied genomics research, and if past lessons from other childhood cancers are repeated, it will identify genes that are fundamentally important in human cancer in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuroblastoma is a common and lethal childhood cancer for which the genetic basis is poorly understood.

Finally, this project should also help catalyze the field of childhood cancer applied genomics research, and if past lessons from other childhood cancers are repeated, it will identify genes that are fundamentally important in human cancer in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuroblastoma is a common and lethal childhood cancer for which the genetic basis is poorly understood. Our genome-wide association study is designed to discover the most common variations in the human genome that lead to the development of neuroblastoma. These insights will lead to new molecular diagnostic assays and/or new treatments for this frequently devastating malignancy of young children.             n/a",The Genetic Basis of Neuroblastoma Tumorigenesis,7461269,R01CA124709,"['Adult', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Children&apos', 's Oncology Group', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Constitutional', 'Country', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Graph', 'HRAS gene', 'Hand', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium Mapping', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'PTEN gene', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'RB1 gene', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Syndrome', 'TP53 gene', 'TSC1 gene', 'TSC2 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'WT1 gene', 'base', 'c-Ha-ras p21', 'cancer genomics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genome wide association study', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2008,675621,0.2064908760951522
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation.

In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7233923,U24CA126561,"['CpG islands', 'clinical research', 'genome', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2006,781539,0.056682028057938746
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8242887,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2012,769079,0.31951112496736866

The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7935041,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,305756,0.31951112496736866
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7387530,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2008,1077416,0.31951112496736866

"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyzehigh throughput gene variant data to explore gene- gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. Mycareer development plan includedidatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. Myresearch proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of blader cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availabilityof epidemiologicand genentic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of GeneticSusceptibilityto Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian,BCcases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. Mygoal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping techology and novel statistical and bioinformaticstools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNArepair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasiancases and 800 Caucasiancontrols using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformaticstools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNArepair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNArepair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BCrisk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformaticsapproaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder caricer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease.

I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease. This study will identify novel genetic markers may be useful as biomarkers to identify high-risk populations that could then be targeted for intervention programs.          n/a","DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk",8065522,K07CA134831,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinogen Metabolism', 'Carcinogens', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutritional', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'career development', 'case control', 'college', 'coping', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genotyping technology', 'high risk', 'intervention program', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'new technology', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistics', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2011,137995,0.14658478579022427

The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses.

"Discovery of genetic elements regulating intraepithelial lymphocytes PROJECT SUMMARY Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are an abundant and heterogeneous population of T cells that reside at the intestinal epithelium, a critical environmental interface between the intestinal tract and the body core. IELs are tasked with maintaining tolerance to a high volume of harmless stimuli from food and commensal microbiota while providing protective immunity against ingested pathogens. Dysregulation of this balance leads to loss of intestinal barrier integrity, susceptibility to enteric infections, and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, many key aspects of IEL development, tissue residence, and function remain unclear, and the pursuit of these questions has been hampered by a lack of genetic targeting strategies for the majority of IEL subsets. We propose to undertake a trait mapping study using the recently established Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mouse cohorts to identify novel genetic factors influencing IEL maturation and tissue maintenance. Recently, we performed quantitative trait loci analysis using these cohorts and identified 78 IEL-associated genomic regions. To determine which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IEL-associated loci are most likely to be causative, we will take a rigorous bioinformatics approach including functional characterization of SNPs, identification of candidate target genes, text mining for published association of candidate genes with relevant ontologies and cell or tissue types, and intestinal gene expression analysis. Further, for at least one candidate IEL-associated SNP identified we will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate SNP mutants in C57BL/6 mice, with the goal of generating genetic models of high or low IEL frequency. These mice will be used to confirm biological relevance of candidate genetic elements in vivo, and will enable extensive future research into IEL function. The proposed work may promote understanding of how IELs contribute to gut homeostasis and suggest novel therapeutic targets for gut inflammatory diseases.

"Discovery of genetic elements regulating intraepithelial lymphocytes PROJECT SUMMARY Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are an abundant and heterogeneous population of T cells that reside at the intestinal epithelium, a critical environmental interface between the intestinal tract and the body core. IELs are tasked with maintaining tolerance to a high volume of harmless stimuli from food and commensal microbiota while providing protective immunity against ingested pathogens. Dysregulation of this balance leads to loss of intestinal barrier integrity, susceptibility to enteric infections, and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, many key aspects of IEL development, tissue residence, and function remain unclear, and the pursuit of these questions has been hampered by a lack of genetic targeting strategies for the majority of IEL subsets. We propose to undertake a trait mapping study using the recently established Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mouse cohorts to identify novel genetic factors influencing IEL maturation and tissue maintenance. Recently, we performed quantitative trait loci analysis using these cohorts and identified 78 IEL-associated genomic regions. To determine which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IEL-associated loci are most likely to be causative, we will take a rigorous bioinformatics approach including functional characterization of SNPs, identification of candidate target genes, text mining for published association of candidate genes with relevant ontologies and cell or tissue types, and intestinal gene expression analysis. Further, for at least one candidate IEL-associated SNP identified we will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate SNP mutants in C57BL/6 mice, with the goal of generating genetic models of high or low IEL frequency. These mice will be used to confirm biological relevance of candidate genetic elements in vivo, and will enable extensive future research into IEL function. The proposed work may promote understanding of how IELs contribute to gut homeostasis and suggest novel therapeutic targets for gut inflammatory diseases.

"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology.

"Genome-wide Case-control Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Jews     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiologic studies have consistently found Jews to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared to non-Jewish whites. This excess risk is not accounted for by BRCA1/2 mutations or by other known risk factors. We therefore propose to examine in Jewish subjects the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations observed in the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium (PanScan) genome-wide association study (GWAS), to perform an exploratory GWAS to identify additional SNPs associated with pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population, and to assess genetic underpinning of the relationship between Jewish ancestry and pancreatic cancer. To do this, we will use GWAS data from PanScan and from the Johns Hopkins University study titled ""Validation and Fine-Scale Mapping of Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility Loci."" In our study, Jewish subjects with be identified with a panel of genetic markers that correlate strongly with self-reported Jewish ancestry. Preliminary sample size calculations, based upon participants in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies, give an estimate of around 500 Jewish cases and 300 unaffected Jewish controls. We will use the program Eigensoft (v.3.0) to conduct a principal component analysis that will genetically identify Jewish subjects among other racial/ethnic groups. We will validate these genetically identified Jews by using a subset of self-reported Jewish subjects in the Yale University, Johns Hopkins, and Memorial Sloan Kettering studies, all sub-studies in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies. We will perform the SNP replication analysis, conduct the GWAS, and will assess genetic contribution using the program PLINK (v.1, 07): whole genome association analysis toolset. Logistic regression models will be used for each SNP, with pancreatic cancer as the outcome variable and each SNP as a predictor variable. Any association with P-value less than 0.05 will be considered significant for the candidate gene approach, and less than 10-6 for the GWAS approach. This will be the first study to determine a genetic basis, distinct from BRCA1/2 mutations, for the excess risk of pancreatic cancer in Jews. Results from this work will open paths to identify genetic interactions and will begin to approach the possibility of genetic screening for pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Jews have repeatedly been found to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer.
