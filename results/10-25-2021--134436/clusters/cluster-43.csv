"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9568854,UH2TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first-in-human', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH2,2018,269386,0.17027201234231015

"Semantic Model of SNOMED as a Bayesian Network  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Clinical pathology data provides a basis for medical decision-making. Uncertainty is introduced into medical-decision-making by irreducible Biologic variability in patient data, ambiguities in communication of data, and the cognition of the decision-making process. Controlled medical terminologies (CMT) and medical decision support systems (DSS) reduce the uncertainty contributed by the latter two sources. Medical DSS are typically comprised of: an interface for data input and output, a knowledge base (KB) for storage of facts, and an inference engine for deriving new information. CMT employ knowledge representation formats similar to those used in DSS KBs. This study will evaluate the semantic network used by the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) for use as a KB in a Bayesian DSS to classify rodent liver disorders using clinical chemistry data. The primary aims of this proposal are to 1) assess SNOMED's ability to represent liver disorder concepts, 2) develop a formal methodology for adapting the semantic network of SNOMED for use in a Bayesian network and 3) evaluate the functionality of the resulting DSS using retrospective clinical chemistry data from drug toxicity studies. If SNOMED can functional as a KB to meet these aims, other domain-specific medical DSS can be created using the methodologies developed in this study.   n/a",Semantic Model of SNOMED as a Bayesian Network,6654454,F37LM007699,"['clinical chemistry', ' computer network', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' drug /agent', ' information systems', ' laboratory rat', ' liver disorder', ' method development', ' pathology', ' postdoctoral investigator', ' toxicology', ' veterinary medicine']",NLM,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,F37,2003,61234,0.1641269118736268

"DR. EPS: Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival Project Summary Human cancers are complex diseases that present vast heterogeneity, leading to widely different survival outcomes. Thus actionable and robust predictive models for cancer prognosis are much needed for more personalized treatment and disease management. However, There has been severely lacking of therapeutically actionable computational methods, which explicitly model patient survival difference as the objective while integrating multi-dimension high-throughput genomics data. To solve this issue, we propose a novel actionable framework for caner drug repurposing, called DR. EPS (Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival). Towards this goal, we will develop the following strategies: (1) Constructing and validating a new class of hybrid-learning based, multi-omics prognosis modeling approach, using seven diverse liver cancer population cohorts. (2) Developing and experimentally validating an actionable computational drug- repurposing framework to improve the survival of high-risk liver cancer patients, using big sets of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics data. (3) Building a user-friendly webtool that accelerates such bench-to-bed transition for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this project will be groundbreaking in many aspects, including building new prognostic models on multi-omics data sets, identifying new repurposed drugs to extend high-risk liver cancer patient life-spans, and providing a first-hand drug reposition resource for liver cancer therapeutics research community.

"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7125135,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2006,387181,0.0893545183304342

A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7052491,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2005,180862,0.0893545183304342
"Metabolomic and Isotopomer Analysis of Xenobiotic Stress DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The goal is to use metabolomics coupled to mass isotopomer analysis to study the metabolic and oxidative stress exerted by two related compounds, i.e.,1,4butanediol (14BD) and gamma-butyrolactone.  These industrial solvents are used extensively in the chemical industry in building materials and in consumer products.  Lastly, they are precursors of the dangerous drug of abuse gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) which is very popular among young people.  The investigators have outlined a strategy to accelerate the disposal of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in the liver.  The coupling of metabolomics to mass isotopomer analysis will provide new avenues for understanding xenobiotic stress.  The aims are:    1. To determine if compounds identified by the metabolomics approach provide new insight into the metabolism of 14BD and GHB.  The investigators will generate a database of metabolic information obtained by mass spectrometric analyses of plasma, urine and liver of control and 14BD- or GHB- exposed rats.  Multivariate statistical methods will reduce the dimensions of the data set of unknown peaks, detecting those that discriminate between treatments.  A number of techniques will be evaluated, including Principal Component Analysis, Fisher Discriminant Analysis and Partial Least Squares.   2. To study the temporal patterns of concentration and mass isotopomer distribution of metabolites extracted from (i) isolated rat livers perfused with unlabeled and uniformly 13C-labeled 14BD and GHB and (ii) the plasma, urine, liver and kidney of rats infused with these compounds.  The rats will be normal or pre-treated with compounds that interfere with the metabolism of 14BD and/or GHB (ethanol, methylpyrazole).  The patterns of change in the profiles following an intervention will be analyzed with a new software tool, Metran, which produces flux estimates with statistical confidence from a pathway model and isotopomer data. The data will also be analyzed by multivariate statistics described in aim 1 to identify discriminating isotopomers, which may provide clues to regulatory mechanisms.   3.

"Genomic and Metabolomic Response to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Aging and aging associated diseases are likely to impart staggering health care costs upon the nation. Hence, there is a critical need to better understand biological aging through the characterization of the molecular changes associated with the aging process, so that potential targets for prevention and therapeutics can be more thoroughly explored. Since chronological age is the best predictor of biological age and age-related diseases, this initiative seeks to profile the metabolic differences between young and old populations of wild type C57BL/6 mice and subsequently study the impact of select stressors on the study population. In addition, since p38 signaling plays a major role in enhancing the expression of some senescence-related genes, stress responses will be investigated in p38a-mutant young and old mice. These mouse models will be used to establish a foundation for future research with human samples and subjects. This proposal is an extension of an ongoing project titled ""Genomic and metabolomic responses to alcohol-induced liver damage"" (5U01ES016013-02) and as such aims to broaden the scope of the original study. This project combines the unique expertise and experience of Frank J. Gonzalez's laboratory (National Cancer Institute) and Albert J. Fornace's laboratory. This competitive supplement will support studies on the effects of aging on injury responses by alcohol as well as select environmental toxicants. These studies will also contribute to the development of aging-associated biomarkers and the elucidation at the metabolomic level of changes occurring during stress-induced cellular senescence and biological aging.                  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the parent grant is to define effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the liver's genomic and metabolic programs, aiming to exploit these ""omic"" alterations for use as biomarkers and potential therapeutic intervention of alcohol-induced liver disease. We expand the work scope for insight into metabolic changes, underscoring biological aging processes and correlating effects of environmental and lifestyle metabolomic changes, underscoring biological aging processes and correlating effects of environmental and lifestyle stressors (alcohol) with aging.

"Genomic and Metabolomic Responses to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Alcohol consumption contributes to 4% of the global disease burden and in the United States is the third leading lifestyle-related cause of death due in part to complications arising from alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD). In addition to obesity, chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) levels that inhibit ¿-oxidation pathways and ultimately cause liver disease (steatosis, inflammation, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Interestingly, the adverse effects of alcohol on the liver, in humans and in mouse models, appear to be due, in part, to attenuation of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa). The alcohol-fed Ppara-null mouse serves as an excellent model for ALD observed in humans and underscores the importance of PPARa in protecting against ALD. Additionally, this mouse model has been cited in over 750 publications supporting its significant utility in understanding the role of PPARa. The mechanism of the influence of PPARa will be determined for potential therapeutic intervention strategies on ALD and for the development of biomarkers for early detection of this disease. To this end, the following specific aims were designed: 1) To correlate alcohol-induced liver damage with gene expression and metabolomic biomarkers identified in alcohol-fed Ppara-null mice for the purpose of developing specific ALD biomarkers.; 2) To identify potential epigenetic and post-transcriptional changes associated with decreased PPARa expression in mouse models following alcohol consumption; and 3) To develop toxicogenomic and toxicometabolomic signatures for types of alcohol-induced injury using primary hepatocyte cultures. These aims seek to understand and integrate the histopathological, genomic, and metabolomic alterations associated with ALD for the purpose of developing early biomarkers associated with ALD pathogenesis. Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to alcohol-induced liver damage (ALD) due to the impairment of ¿-oxidation pathways and subsequent development of fatty liver. A key regulator of ¿-oxidation is the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa). Alcohol-fed mice lacking PPARa develop human-like ALD and in this project will be used to develop biomarkers that are indicative of ALD progression.              n/a",Genomic and Metabolomic Responses to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage,8121765,U01ES016013,"['Abbreviations', 'Adverse effects', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Liver', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Knockout Mice', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'NADH', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Obesity', 'PPAR alpha', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Peroxisome Proliferators', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publications', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Toxicogenomics', 'United States', 'Universities', 'alcohol response', 'aldehyde dehydrogenases', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'clinical application', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'oxidation', 'programs', 'promoter', 'toxicant', 'urinary']",NIEHS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,119045,0.17539265225801265

"Genomic and Metabolomic Responses to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Alcohol consumption contributes to 4% of the global disease burden and in the United States is the third leading lifestyle-related cause of death due in part to complications arising from alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD). In addition to obesity, chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) levels that inhibit ¿-oxidation pathways and ultimately cause liver disease (steatosis, inflammation, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Interestingly, the adverse effects of alcohol on the liver, in humans and in mouse models, appear to be due, in part, to attenuation of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa). The alcohol-fed Ppara-null mouse serves as an excellent model for ALD observed in humans and underscores the importance of PPARa in protecting against ALD. Additionally, this mouse model has been cited in over 750 publications supporting its significant utility in understanding the role of PPARa. The mechanism of the influence of PPARa will be determined for potential therapeutic intervention strategies on ALD and for the development of biomarkers for early detection of this disease. To this end, the following specific aims were designed: 1) To correlate alcohol-induced liver damage with gene expression and metabolomic biomarkers identified in alcohol-fed Ppara-null mice for the purpose of developing specific ALD biomarkers.; 2) To identify potential epigenetic and post-transcriptional changes associated with decreased PPARa expression in mouse models following alcohol consumption; and 3) To develop toxicogenomic and toxicometabolomic signatures for types of alcohol-induced injury using primary hepatocyte cultures. These aims seek to understand and integrate the histopathological, genomic, and metabolomic alterations associated with ALD for the purpose of developing early biomarkers associated with ALD pathogenesis.

"Hepatic Steatosis and the Lipid Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) is an early and reversible stage of both alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which are major causes of liver-associated illness and death. However, unchecked hepatic steatosis can advance to irreversible steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. Our objective is to elucidate the mechanisms leading to fatty liver, develop a biomarker signature of fatty liver to aid early diagnosis, and identify molecular targets for intervention at this early and reversible stage of liver diseases. Our preliminary studies suggest that diminished S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-mediated methylation of cellular molecules is responsible for fatty liver because rats given a SAM precursor-deficient diet demonstrated hepatic steatosis and hypomethylation of lipids. We hypothesize that decreased cellular methylation leads to fatty liver, which can be characterized by an altered lipid metabolome (lipidome), especially decreased methylated lipids, to serve as a biomarker signature of steatosis. Metabolomics will be used to test this hypothesis in rats where methylation of biomolecules is compromised by a SAM precursor-deficient diet (aim 1), a situation exacerbated by alcohol consumption (aim 2), and which can be reversed by dietary supplement (betaine) (aim 3). Lipid-associated changes of the metabolome and proteome (in biosynthesis, degradation and transport) will be correlated in the plasma and liver so that plasma changes can serve as a biomarker signature of hepatic steatosis. This project will be conducted by an experienced multidisciplinary team including lipid chemists/biochemists, a hepatologist, a pathologist and bioinformatricians. Our results should establish that SAM deficiency is central to liver steatosis and exacerbated by alcohol abuse. By using trans-omic techniques (metabolomics, proteomics and genomics) we will identify a novel biomarker signature (methylated lipids) of hepatic steatosis which can ultimately be utilized for diagnosis of steatosis. Furthermore, the sequence of events leading to fatty liver identification by these trans-omic techniques should identify molecular targets for an early intervention.

However, unchecked hepatic steatosis can advance to irreversible steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. Our objective is to elucidate the mechanisms leading to fatty liver, develop a biomarker signature of fatty liver to aid early diagnosis, and identify molecular targets for intervention at this early and reversible stage of liver diseases. Our preliminary studies suggest that diminished S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-mediated methylation of cellular molecules is responsible for fatty liver because rats given a SAM precursor-deficient diet demonstrated hepatic steatosis and hypomethylation of lipids. We hypothesize that decreased cellular methylation leads to fatty liver, which can be characterized by an altered lipid metabolome (lipidome), especially decreased methylated lipids, to serve as a biomarker signature of steatosis. Metabolomics will be used to test this hypothesis in rats where methylation of biomolecules is compromised by a SAM precursor-deficient diet (aim 1), a situation exacerbated by alcohol consumption (aim 2), and which can be reversed by dietary supplement (betaine) (aim 3). Lipid-associated changes of the metabolome and proteome (in biosynthesis, degradation and transport) will be correlated in the plasma and liver so that plasma changes can serve as a biomarker signature of hepatic steatosis. This project will be conducted by an experienced multidisciplinary team including lipid chemists/biochemists, a hepatologist, a pathologist and bioinformatricians. Our results should establish that SAM deficiency is central to liver steatosis and exacerbated by alcohol abuse. By using trans-omic techniques (metabolomics, proteomics and genomics) we will identify a novel biomarker signature (methylated lipids) of hepatic steatosis which can ultimately be utilized for diagnosis of steatosis. Furthermore, the sequence of events leading to fatty liver identification by these trans-omic techniques should identify molecular targets for an early intervention.

"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades.

"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades.

"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population).

"HEPATOCYTE-DERIVED MIF: A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a significant cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Alcohol- related morbidity and mortality has remained constant over the past decades, and drinking rates in developed countries continue to increase. ALD is a spectrum disorder encompassing steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis and even progressing to liver cancer. Therapies for ALD, and specifically AH, are unchanged for 40 years as well as ineffective for a significant proportion of ALD patients. Identifying novel biomarkers of ALD progression and the development of targeted therapies is of marked interest to public health and welfare. Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), a ubiquitously expressed regulator of innate immunity with chemokine- and cytokine-like activities, is associated with ALD in humans and in ethanol feeding models in animals. MIF is increased in circulation in AH and cirrhosis patients, MIF protein expression is robustly increased in hepatocytes of AH patients, and MIF is predictive of liver morbidity and patient mortality in AH. In animal models of ethanol feeding, MIF deficiency protects from ethanol-induced liver injury and normalizes ethanol- induced inflammation and hepatocyte ER stress. Taken together, these data identified the hepatocyte as a likely tissue source and site of action for aberrant MIF expression and downstream activity in ALD. The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that that chronic, excessive alcohol increases hepatocyte MIF release that acts as a potent upstream regulator of Alcoholic Liver Disease progression through control of chemokine expression, chemokine packaging, and liver ER stress. The work proposed herein will utilize tissue-specific MIF knockouts, MIF receptor knockouts and a novel small-molecule MIF inhibitor to interrogate the role of hepatocyte-derived MIF in multiple alcohol feeding models in animals, ethanol exposure in primary hepatocyte cultures, and in human ALD patient tissues. Furthermore, the protective phenotype in MIF-deficient mice is associated with profound changes in chemokine expression in the liver and in circulating extracellular vesicles (EV). EVs are pivotal intracellular communication mediators, and the chemokine cargoes in EVs are quite dynamic in both ethanol- and MIF-dependent mechanisms. The other aim of this proposal will then transition to explore what leads to this increased hepatic MIF expression in ALD. A database search of mircoRNAs from ALD patient livers (GEO series GSE59492) revealed that a potent negative regulator of MIF expression, miR-451, is decreased along the spectrum of ALD and was selective to an alcoholic etiology of disease. The project will then expand to study EVs as a novel mechanism of therapeutic transfer in ALD, as the proposed studies will look to normalize MIF expression through restoring miR-451 expression as well as selectively inhibit MIF in the liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic liver disease is a major socioeconomic burden in the United States with limited, ineffective therapeutic interventions.

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.3162843602076066

"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,0.2657551014789975
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years.

"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.

"Transplantation Assay for Liver Repopulating Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult intrahepatic progenitor/stem cells capable of producing both bile ducts and hepatocytes during injury responses are of great importance in liver biology, both in health and disease. During the past funding period we have finally been able to home in on this long elusive cell population. It is now possible to prospectively isolate te intrahepatic stem cell of mice by FACS, to culture it in vitro and to perform lineage tracing in vivo. We have performed gene expression profiling on LPCs both in the resting state and after activation of the oval cell response. This analysis has revealed several novel genes unique to this population, suggesting that they play important roles in their maintenance and/or function. Using genetic tools it is therefore now possible to explore the function of these factors in liver progenitors. This information will be useful to control and manipulate the behavior of LPC both in vivo and in vitro for the purposes of regenerative medicine. We also have been able to establish expandable cultures of human LPC and thus will be able to translate lessons from the murine system to human biology. In this application, we propose to systematically explore the function of key genes unique to adult LPC (Aim1), to use genomic approaches to understand the oval cell activation process in greater depth (Aim2) and to test the utility of human LPC as an expandable source of hepatocytes (Aim3) . Successful completion of this research will result deepen our understanding of the molecular controls governing adult liver progenitors and make them amenable to therapeutic manipulations. Intrahepatic stem cells play an important role in the ability of the liver to regenerate during disease and damage, especially chronic injury. Until recently, the precise identity and location of this cell remained unknown, but now we and others have found methods to isolate these cells from both mice and humans.

"COMPUTED 3D SURFACE AND VOLUME ESTIMATION IN CT AND MRI The goal of this proposal is to bring the benefits of routine, accurate 3D volume estimation and display, currently implemented exclusively on high contrast boundaries, to low contrast, soft tissue lesions and organs.  We will develop, refine and apply new, robust, automatic surface finding algorithms which require minimal operator intervention to define the spatial extent of low contrast, soft tissue lesions and organs in x- ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods proposed involve usage of segmentation, and robust gradient techniques for general lesion/organ surface detection, and geometric model-guided blackboard techniques for specific organ surface detection. Algorithm development will include adaptation of a new 3D segmentation algorithm originally developed for computer vision under funding from the National Science Foundation for segmentation of 3D medical data sets. Since this segmentation algorithm is the first to perform functional segmentation on 3D data, it potentially represents a revolutionary breakthrough to the problem of disparate edge generation arising from the use of 2D techniques on a slice-by-slice basis. In addition, we will apply new robust edge segment detection and spline linking algorithms to gradient magnitude images computed from the original data set using 3D gradient operators.  Bivariate tensor splines will yield 3D lesion surfaces.  Since single approach techniques tend to lack the required information to achieve nearly 100% detection accuracy, we will also implement a knowledge-based blackboard system to guide surface detection of the liver using an a priori, geometric shape model.  While artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to medical imaging data in the past, to our knowledge this specific geometric model-guided blackboard approach to lever is new, and has a significant chance of achieving a sufficiently high accuracy so as to nearly eliminate operator assistance or editing.  We are able to apply this technique to the liver (organ systems in general) because they have a normal shape and location. Evaluation of the algorithms will make major use of clinical data sets from patients undergoing radiation and chemo therapy for focal liver carcinoma, osteogenic and soft tissue sarcomas, as well as physical and computer generated phantoms.

"Macrophage Cell Subset Specific Biomarkers for Disease Prognosis in Biliary Atresia PROJECT SUMMARY: Biliary atresia (BA) is a cholestatic liver disease of infancy that is the leading cause of pediatric liver transplantation. While evidence supports a role for an aberrant immune response in the pathogenesis of BA, the exact mechanism of disease remains unknown. This gap in scientific knowledge limits identification of immune biomarkers at diagnosis to stratify patient prognosis. While macrophages (M) have previously been implicated in both human and murine BA, M are heterogeneous by nature and the pathogenic subsets required for ongoing hepatic injury have not been identified. Overcoming this gap in scientific knowledge will identify the BA-specific pathogenic M subsets and lead to novel cell-subset specific biomarkers predictive of patient prognosis. We have been the first to identify 3 novel hepatic M subsets in pediatric cholestatic liver disease at the time of liver transplant that are distinct from non-diseased M by leveraging the ability of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We have defined these M subsets as lipid-associated M (high expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism), monocyte-like M (expression of genes also identified in monocytes), and adaptive M (enrichment for genes involved in lymphocyte activation). Furthermore, monocyte-like and adaptive M subsets positively correlate with the poor prognostic signature at diagnosis established by Luo et al suggesting these subsets may drive fibrosis and activation of CD8-positive T cells implicated in disease outcome. We thereby hypothesize that serum cytokine networks drive M polarization towards pathogenic monocyte-like and adaptive M subsets; increased numbers of these M subsets by histology at diagnosis will be associated with poor outcome. To investigative this hypothesis we will: 1) determine if the numbers of lipid-associated, monocyte-like, and adaptive M at diagnosis in human BA correlate with outcome as defined by clearance of jaundice by 3 months post-Kasai Portoenterostomy (KPE), and 2) define M-specific cytokine networks in serum that correlate with prognosis and histologic findings. This innovative research plan applies findings from previous scRNA-seq analysis to human samples available from ChiLDReN to identify M-subset specific histologic and serum biomarkers for prognosis at the time of diagnosis. Findings from the study will advance the care of patients with BA and allow for improved prognostic counseling at the time of KPE. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Biliary atresia (BA) is a cholestatic liver disease of infancy that is the leading cause of pediatric liver transplantation. Evidence supports a role for the immune system, particularly the macrophage cell, in progressive liver damage, however, early immune predictors of outcome have not been developed. In the current study, we will be the first to define macrophage-specific markers at diagnosis that correlate with patient outcome and improve early risk stratification in BA.",Macrophage Cell Subset Specific Biomarkers for Disease Prognosis in Biliary Atresia,10210749,U01DK062436,"['Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary Atresia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Core Facility', 'Counseling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Icterus', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Slide', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Universities', 'cholestatic liver disease', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'imager', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interleukin-23', 'knowledge translation', 'lipid metabolism', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'liver injury', 'liver transplantation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'protein expression', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'specific biomarkers', 'total measurement Bilirubin', 'translational study']",NIDDK,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,U01,2020,167700,0.18186659667557162
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors.

Recent research has shed new light on the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is expressed in liver and intestine. PXR coordinately regulates the drug-inducible expression of drug-transporting and drug-metabolizing proteins in liver and intestine. PXR binds to xenobiotic-response elements (XREs) in the promoters of its target genes as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR). One extremely important PXR-target gene is the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) gene. CYP3A4 is primarily expressed in liver and intestine where it catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of nearly 60% of all clinically prescribed drugs. The hepatic expression of CYP3A4 and other PXR-target genes is rapidly suppressed in response to inflammatory cytokines, though the molecular basis of this repression is currently unknown. Repression of PXR-target gene expression occurs in people that undergo invasive surgery in response to inflammation, thereby producing altered pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in these patients. PXR is activated by a plethora of structurally diverse molecules including drugs, steroids, bile acids, and xenobiotics. Therefore, repression of PXR-target gene expression can produce potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions. Thus, it is important to understand the molecular basis of the repression of PXR-target genes in order to predict and prevent the occurrence of drug interactions in post-operative patients. An alteration in the phosphorylation status of transcriptional regulatory proteins is a likely mechanism that mediates the repression of PXR-target gene expression following inflammation. The goals of these investigations are to (1) identify the sites of PXR phosphorylation following activation of specific cell signaling pathways, and (2) determine the effect of increased PXR phosphorylation on it's ability to (a) transactivate, (b) bind DNA, (c) translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and (d) interact with protein co-factors. Successful completion of these studies will allow us to determine the molecular basis of the repression of key drug metabolizing genes during the inflammatory response and provide increased opportunities to understand the xenobiotic response. These studies will provide additional insight into the regulation of drug disposition and drug-drug interaction. n/a","Cell Signaling, PXR Phosphorylation & Drug Disposition",7656908,R01DK068443,"['7alpha hydroxylase', 'Bile Acids', 'Bile fluid', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood coagulation', 'CYP3A4 gene', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytochrome P450 3A4', 'Cytochromes', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug Transport', 'Excretory function', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Gluconeogenesis', 'Glucose', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Proteins', 'RXR', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Steroids', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transactivation', 'Transcription Regulatory Protein', 'Xenobiotics', 'activating transcription factor', 'base', 'citrate carrier', 'cofactor', 'cytochrome P-450 CYP2C subfamily', 'cytokine', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'insight', 'member', 'pregnane X receptor', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'text searching']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R01,2009,244790,0.20345697395086393

"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7487344,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,351137,0.212590337470216

"Uppper Midwest Drug Hepatoxicity Consortium There is a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding host susceptibility and mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. To date, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has succeeded in maintaining a prospective registry of well-defined cases with DILI to further research in this area. The long- term-goal is to understand the genetic influence on mechanisms and clinical outcomes of DILI. Critical to the success for improved understanding of pathogenesis, the objective of this application is to further expand the registry by including additional patients with DILI from geographic areas not currently within the Network. In response to RFA-DK-07-712 (Continuation and Expansion of the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network), the Central Hypothesis of this application is to effectively contribute well-definedcases of DILI and propose novel mechanistic studies examining phenotype-genotype associations. The proposed research is relevant to that part of the NIH mission which pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burden of disease. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. Specific Aim 1will focus on the identification and enrollment of cases with bona fide DILI and matched controls within a diverse racial and ethnic geographic population of 7 million individuals. Based on recent clinical experience with DILI, this consortium anticipates the enrollment of 250 cases affected by DILI and 750 matched controls with appropriate biospecimen collections over a 5 year period. Specific Aim 2 outlines a series of proposed experiments to determine whether differentialactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) from endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic DILI. The proposed work is innovative based on the coupling of advanced bioinformatics technology, extensive clinical experience, and recognized expertise in liver cell injury and genetic epidemiology. In turn, we are enthusiastic to work cooperatively with the Clinical Centers, the Data Coordinating Center, and sponsoring organizations in this expanded Network to oversee the implementation of and adherence to common protocols.

"An integrated genomic and lipidomic approach to human hepatic fat accumulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this study is to identify genetic factors controlling the accumulation of various lipids in human liver, using a system approach with integrated genomic and lipidomic (i.e. lipids family) data. Hepatic fat accumulation is a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and various metabolic complications. Its mechanism, especially the genetic basis underlying the fat accumulation, is incompletely elucidated. This is largely attributed to insufficient understanding of the complexity of lipid metabolism and homeostasis. Since a wide range of lipids are involved in fat accumulation and the associated metabolic consequences, it is particularly necessary to investigate the lipid process at the system level. We hypothesize that the contents of various lipids and their metabolites in the livers of the general population are quantitative traits significantly controlled by genetic factors; and the discovery of these genetic loci could provide better insight on the hepatic fat accumulation and associated diseases. To accomplish this, we propose to perform a comprehensive genetic mapping for lipidome using a large collection of liver tissues (n=213) in which the total fat content is differentiated, and for which genome-wide genotypic and transcriptomic data have been previously collected. We will: 1) profile >400 different lipids in each of the 213 livers; 2) perform genome-wide association study to identified polymorphisms and genes associated with variations in hepatic lipidome; and 3) validate the discovered associations in an independent liver sample set (n=70). We anticipate that this study will identify critical genes, alleles and pathways conferring susceptibility to imbalanced lipid accumulation in human liver, and will thus provide potential markers and targets for early diagnosis and intervention of NAFLD and related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will discover genes and DNA variants responsible for the accumulation of fat and fat fractions in human liver, a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and many other metabolic diseases, e.g. obesity and diabetes. This study will produce important information for attaining a better understanding of the development of these diseases. The study will also potentially identify molecular targets that could be used to develop better treatment.                 Project Narrative This study will discover genes and DNA variants responsible for the accumulation of fat and fat fractions in human liver, a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and many other metabolic diseases, e.g. obesity and diabetes.

"Expanding the pool of transplantable human livers by modeling perfusion dynamics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a drastic shortage of transplantable livers in the US with approximately 17,000 individuals each year on the waiting list, but only 6,000 per year receiving transplants. This shortage can be significantly reduced if marginal livers with suboptimal characteristics, such as those with prolonged warm ischemia time (WIT) due to cardiac death donor (DCD), older donor age, or moderate steatosis, can also be included in the pool of transplantable livers. In this project, we propose subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) as a platform to metabolically precondition and recover marginal livers prior to transplantation, thus expanding the donor pool size. In Aim 1 of this proposal, our objective is to test SNMP for the first time as a proof of concept on discarded human livers, which get donated to our lab approximately once per week. We will collect perfusate, bile, and tissue biopsy samples to analyze the liver's dynamic metabolic profile in perfusion. The tissue biopsy samples will be sent to the UC Davis Metabolomics Core to determine relative levels of ~150 intracellular metabolites from primary metabolites and ~300 lipid compounds. We will then correlate the dynamic metabolic profiles to donor characteristics using multi-way principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis. The expected outcome of this aim will be to develop a new set of cutoff metrics based on donor characteristics (age, WIT, and steatosis) to determine if a liver is transplantable after SNMP. In Aim 2, our objective is to better understand metabolic dynamics during perfusion and gain more mechanistic insight into how SNMP reverses WIT-induced injury. We will borrow computational modeling approaches from systems biology to explain trends observed with the time-course intracellular metabolomics data and determine which metabolic pathways are up or down regulated during perfusion. We will construct a stoichiometric/regulatory reaction network to describe hepatocyte metabolism, and apply structural kinetic modeling (SKM) to determine the most likely explanation of pathway flux changes to explain the metabolite data. By comparing the dynamics of a healthy liver, and one with long WIT, our expected outcome of this aim is to discover which metabolic pathways are responsible for reversing ischemic injury in perfusion. Our long term goal is to replace the current system of donor liver assessment to include an SNMP step, which will provide two key benefits: 1.) Improve the metabolic condition of suboptimal grafts, particularly those from DCDs with longer WITs and 2.) Provide the transplant surgeon in the operating room with a more robust set of quantitative biomarkers based on perfusion measurements to assess if a liver can be transplanted. The broader impact of this work is that it has the potential to save thousands of lives of those with liver failure. In addition, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to integate systems biology and metabolomics data to model the dynamics of a live human organ and should serve as an example for others trying to use time-course biopsies to model tissue metabolism in vivo.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we propose to use subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) of human livers prior to transplantation in order to reverse ischemic injury caused by prolonged warm ischemia and exacerbated by donor age and degree of steatosis. The perfusion system will also allow us to perform metabolomics analysis on biopsies, with which we will apply computational kinetic modeling and multivariate statistical analysis to improve classification metrics for liver transplantability. The broader impact of the studies will e the eventual use of SNMP in a clinical setting, allowing for the donor pool size of transplantable livers will significantly increase.        ",Expanding the pool of transplantable human livers by modeling perfusion dynamics,8928491,F32DK103500,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior', 'Bile fluid', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Ischemia', 'Kinetics', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Liver Failure', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operating Rooms', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reaction', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Waiting Lists', 'Warm Ischemia', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'liver biopsy', 'liver function', 'liver ischemia', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preconditioning', 'public health relevance', 'time use', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2015,58694,0.2949197221097986

"LIPIDOMICS BASED DIAGNOSTICS FOR NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that affects 3-4% of the adult population and progresses to cirrhosis in 15-20% of affected subjects. There is currently no approved therapy for NASH and the only accurate method to diagnose this condition is a liver biopsy which is invasive, painful and occasionally associated with mortality. The lack of a ""point-of-care"" diagnostic tool to diagnose NASH, to assess disease progression versus regression and response to various therapeutics is considered by many to be the most important barrier towards large scale identification of affected individuals and for drug-development against NASH. This proposal represents a multi-PI effort to develop a lipidomics-based biomarker panel to fill these gaps in knowledge. Dr. Sanyal (PI) from the NIDDK NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) will lead this effort and Dr. Dennis (Co-PI) who previously led the NIGMS LIPID_MAPS consortium will lead the lipid analysis. The NASH CRN data coordinating center (DCC) will continue to serve as the DCC for this proposal. The studies will draw from the NASH CRN biorepository which contains plasma drawn at the time of a liver biopsy from over 2000 highly phenotyped subjects with NAFLD. Three specific aims will test the hypothesis that changes in lipid metabolism in NAFLD allow identification of a circulating lipid signature diagnostic of NASH, disease progression and response to specific therapies. Aim 1 will define and validate a circulating lipid profile diagnostic of underlying NASH and its severity. A model building cohort and two validation cohorts will be studied. The model building cohort will include subjects with and without NAFLD. The validation cohort will include: (1) a group of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD and age, gender, race and weight-matched controls without NAFLD, and (2) a prospective group of subjects in a ""real-world"" setting who are going to receive a clinically-indicated liver biopsy for suspected NASH. Aim 2 will define changes in circulating lipids diagnostic of disease progression in NASH. This will be accomplished by performing lipidomic analyses on plasma drawn at the time of baseline liver biopsies in a cohort of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD who have undergone two or more liver biopsies. Aim 3 will define the circulating lipid signature associated with treatment-induced improvement of NASH. This will utilize unique sample-sets obtained during protocol-driven biopsies from subjects enrolled in clinical trials by the NASH CRN. The studies will further innovate by applying the state-of-the-art analytic platforms developed by LIPID_MAPS for diagnostics development for NASH. Preliminary data support the feasibility of the proposed studies and aims. These studies will meet all of the quality metrics for accuracy assessment of diagnostics (QUADAS) and will have a strong positive impact on the field by allowing development of a diagnostic platform that will permit point of care evaluation of NASH. This will enhance access to care and eventually improve the health of the people thereby aligning with the mission of the NIH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a great clinical and public health need to develop a diagnostic method to allow ""point-of-care"" diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, assess its progression towards cirrhosis and to evaluate its response to various treatments.

"LIPIDOMICS BASED DIAGNOSTICS FOR NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that affects 3-4% of the adult population and progresses to cirrhosis in 15-20% of affected subjects. There is currently no approved therapy for NASH and the only accurate method to diagnose this condition is a liver biopsy which is invasive, painful and occasionally associated with mortality. The lack of a ""point-of-care"" diagnostic tool to diagnose NASH, to assess disease progression versus regression and response to various therapeutics is considered by many to be the most important barrier towards large scale identification of affected individuals and for drug-development against NASH. This proposal represents a multi-PI effort to develop a lipidomics-based biomarker panel to fill these gaps in knowledge. Dr. Sanyal (PI) from the NIDDK NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) will lead this effort and Dr. Dennis (Co-PI) who previously led the NIGMS LIPID_MAPS consortium will lead the lipid analysis. The NASH CRN data coordinating center (DCC) will continue to serve as the DCC for this proposal. The studies will draw from the NASH CRN biorepository which contains plasma drawn at the time of a liver biopsy from over 2000 highly phenotyped subjects with NAFLD. Three specific aims will test the hypothesis that changes in lipid metabolism in NAFLD allow identification of a circulating lipid signature diagnostic of NASH, disease progression and response to specific therapies. Aim 1 will define and validate a circulating lipid profile diagnostic of underlying NASH and its severity. A model building cohort and two validation cohorts will be studied. The model building cohort will include subjects with and without NAFLD. The validation cohort will include: (1) a group of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD and age, gender, race and weight-matched controls without NAFLD, and (2) a prospective group of subjects in a ""real-world"" setting who are going to receive a clinically-indicated liver biopsy for suspected NASH. Aim 2 will define changes in circulating lipids diagnostic of disease progression in NASH. This will be accomplished by performing lipidomic analyses on plasma drawn at the time of baseline liver biopsies in a cohort of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD who have undergone two or more liver biopsies. Aim 3 will define the circulating lipid signature associated with treatment-induced improvement of NASH. This will utilize unique sample-sets obtained during protocol-driven biopsies from subjects enrolled in clinical trials by the NASH CRN. The studies will further innovate by applying the state-of-the-art analytic platforms developed by LIPID_MAPS for diagnostics development for NASH. Preliminary data support the feasibility of the proposed studies and aims. These studies will meet all of the quality metrics for accuracy assessment of diagnostics (QUADAS) and will have a strong positive impact on the field by allowing development of a diagnostic platform that will permit point of care evaluation of NASH.

"Identifying drug toxicity signatures using QCarrays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This Phase I SBIR project uses a new Quality Control microarray (QCarray) technology to generate Drug Toxicity Signatures (DTSs) for predicting liver toxicity in rat. The QCarray enables each element on every array to have a quality control (QC) score and markedly reduces a common source of error: fabrication of the cDNA microarrays. A second source of variability in arrays is genetic heterogeneity; therefore, we will benchmark the QCarray and look for DTSs using the PharmGenix Panel. The PharmGenix Panel models a heterozygous, variable genetic background in a controlled setting while reliably detecting drug toxicity. PhysioGenix will leverage archived tissues from previous PharmGenix drug studies and generate liver-specific DTSs to four different hepatotoxins. Matarray software will QC and normalize array data while principal component analysis will cluster expression patterns according to clinical chemistry, to help to determine informative DTSs. Phase II efforts will generate DTSs for toxicity to kidney and heart, and compare the liver DTSs to non-human primates. The common DTSs will be posited to be predictive biomarkers in the drug development process.

"Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For many severe liver diseases, the only effective treatment is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, due to the shortage of available donor organs, or the patient's age, liver transplantation is not available to all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is an alternative, experimental treatment, with limited long term success in humans. A major unsolved question is how can we dynamically monitor and quantify cell transplantation in HTx to help improve HTx and to closely monitor clinical implementation?  To answer this question, we combine an innovative molecular and cellular MRI approach, with machine learning and computer vision, to non-invasively quantify cell engraftment and long term engraftment and repopulation (LTER) in the liver following HTx. Using a mouse model that facilitates LTER following HTx, we will use this combined approach to quantify transplanted cells in the liver at Days 1 and 7 after HTx, reflecting the timings of initial cell delivery (Day 1) and actual cellular engraftment in the tissue (Day 7). Then, we will measure LTER of these cells in the liver 30 - 90 days post-transplant, making innovative use of Eovist, an FDA approved MRI contrast agent specific for healthy hepatocytes. These experiments will evaluate mouse donor cells, as well as pig primary hepatocytes and pig embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte cell line.  This transformative work will be the first study to achieve this level of quantification wit molecular and cellular MRI of regenerative medicine, in any animal model. Additionally, we will test pattern recognition algorithms aimed at predicting the outcome of LTER, at an early stage. The capability to predict LTER outcome would be paradigm shifting as it would enable physicians to consider additional HTx regimens or second line treatments if HTx fails. This is seldom possible.  Though this project will be developed on mice, clinical translation of the imaging protocol would be straightforward because the exact imaging and data analysis scheme that we use to measure HTx in mouse, can be used to measure HTx in humans. Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells.

Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells. This project proposes new molecular and cellular MRI methods and analysis protocols to quantify hepatocyte transplantation and long term engraftment and repopulation. Successful completion of this project opens up the near term possibility for clinical utility.            ",Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation,9006872,R01DK107697,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Engraftment', 'FDA approved', 'Family suidae', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Germ Cells', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatocyte transplantation', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Liver Failure', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Weight', 'Wit', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'embryonic stem cell', 'hepatocyte engraftment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'islet', 'liver transplantation', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical research', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIDDK,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,489308,0.2176269805559517
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10068549,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,81310,0.3737993477781261
"Respiratory Motion-Reduced Cone-Beam CT Guidance of Radiotherapy in Lung & Liver    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research project is to improve the accuracy and reliability of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) guidance of radiation treatment in lung and liver. The treatment of inoperable tumors in lung and liver remains a therapeutic challenge. Increasing the radiation dose improves local control but requires high-precision techniques. There is widespread interest in linear accelerator-mounted CBCT systems for guiding radiation treatment, but respiratory motion adversely affects CBCT image quality and limits its accuracy. We propose to develop and evaluate methods to reduce respiratory-induced motion artifacts in CBCT. Our hypotheses are: 1) motion-reduction techniques will improve tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) visibility and localization accuracy in lung and liver, relative to current CBCT methods; 2) motion-reduced CBCT will enable the use of contrast enhancement for localizing liver metastases at treatment, as an alternative to implanted fiducials; and 3) the improved localization accuracy will permit smaller treatment volumes, thereby enabling safe delivery of higher radiation doses. Our specific aims are to 1) develop and validate a model of respiration-induced motion adapted to each patient from respiration-correlated CT and CBCT images; 2) develop a method to reduce motion artifacts in CBCT using the patient-specific motion model; and 3) evaluate motion- reduced CBCT in patients treated with radiation for nonsmall cell lung cancer or liver metastases. The patient-specific motion model uses nonrigid image registration between CT or CBCT images at different respiratory motion states to generate 3D trajectories of all voxels in the volume images. An important component of the model is a principal component analysis that reduces the high-dimensional complex data set to a lower dimension by removing noise and redundancy. The motion reduction procedure sorts the CBCT projections into motion states according to the respiratory signal, reconstructs and morphs the volume image at each motion state to a reference image by means of the patient's motion model, then combines the morphed images to produce a high quality CBCT image. Evaluation of the accuracy of the proposed methods will use physical and analytical deformable phantoms, and manual delineations of clinical images. The first phase of patient studies will compare the ability to visualize and localize tumor and OAR before and after model-based motion reduction improvements to CBCT image quality, using gated CBCT as a reference. The imaging study in liver will test the feasibility of detecting metastatic lesions using motion-reduced CBCT in combination with intravenous contrast injection. The second phase of studies will use motion-reduced CBCT to correct patient position prior to hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung, and determine the fraction of patients for whom higher prescribed dose is achieved through margin reduction made possible by the improved localization accuracy.

The first phase of patient studies will compare the ability to visualize and localize tumor and OAR before and after model-based motion reduction improvements to CBCT image quality, using gated CBCT as a reference. The imaging study in liver will test the feasibility of detecting metastatic lesions using motion-reduced CBCT in combination with intravenous contrast injection. The second phase of studies will use motion-reduced CBCT to correct patient position prior to hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung, and determine the fraction of patients for whom higher prescribed dose is achieved through margin reduction made possible by the improved localization accuracy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is widespread interest in medical accelerator-mounted cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems for improving the accuracy of radiation treatment; however, breathing motion can blur the images and limit our ability to locate and target tumors in lung and liver. We propose to develop methods to reduce blur and distortion in CBCT images caused by breathing motion.

"Respiratory Motion-Reduced Cone-Beam CT Guidance of Radiotherapy in Lung & Liver    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research project is to improve the accuracy and reliability of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) guidance of radiation treatment in lung and liver. The treatment of inoperable tumors in lung and liver remains a therapeutic challenge. Increasing the radiation dose improves local control but requires high-precision techniques. There is widespread interest in linear accelerator-mounted CBCT systems for guiding radiation treatment, but respiratory motion adversely affects CBCT image quality and limits its accuracy. We propose to develop and evaluate methods to reduce respiratory-induced motion artifacts in CBCT. Our hypotheses are: 1) motion-reduction techniques will improve tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) visibility and localization accuracy in lung and liver, relative to current CBCT methods; 2) motion-reduced CBCT will enable the use of contrast enhancement for localizing liver metastases at treatment, as an alternative to implanted fiducials; and 3) the improved localization accuracy will permit smaller treatment volumes, thereby enabling safe delivery of higher radiation doses. Our specific aims are to 1) develop and validate a model of respiration-induced motion adapted to each patient from respiration-correlated CT and CBCT images; 2) develop a method to reduce motion artifacts in CBCT using the patient-specific motion model; and 3) evaluate motion- reduced CBCT in patients treated with radiation for nonsmall cell lung cancer or liver metastases. The patient-specific motion model uses nonrigid image registration between CT or CBCT images at different respiratory motion states to generate 3D trajectories of all voxels in the volume images. An important component of the model is a principal component analysis that reduces the high-dimensional complex data set to a lower dimension by removing noise and redundancy. The motion reduction procedure sorts the CBCT projections into motion states according to the respiratory signal, reconstructs and morphs the volume image at each motion state to a reference image by means of the patient's motion model, then combines the morphed images to produce a high quality CBCT image.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM).

My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8134899,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2011,134067,0.1463846711920596
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses.

"Optimization and Evaluation of Anatomical Models of Liver Radiation Response The full utilization of radiation for liver cancer is limited by uncertainty in the radiation toxicity risk for patients with underlying liver disease and the inability to compute aggregate dose in the re-treatment setting due to large anatomical changes in responses to therapy. The NCI hepatocellular cancer working group has stated that the use of radiation to downstage prior to liver transplant should be a clinical research priority. In this setting, it is essential to induce complete ablation of the macroscopic disease, which has been shown to correlate with increased disease free survival, while maintaining a low toxicity profile. Functional imaging is beginning to play a role in understanding the impact of radiation on liver function, however the translation of image-based assessments have been hampered by the inability to accurately link the serially acquired images indicating response over time with an accurate assessment of the therapy that was delivered. Early experience with dynamic multi-organ anatomical models demonstrated that deformation technologies can improve treatment design, delivery, and evaluation of the accumulated dose in both the tumor and normal tissues. However, it was noted in these investigations that currently available anatomical models were not sufficient to describe complex deformation due the therapeutic response, notably in the liver where hypertrophy is observed in areas receiving minimal dose and fibrosis/necrosis/atrophy occurs in higher dose regions. Currently, there is not a clear understanding of determinants of hypertrophy/atrophy and methods to optimize this effect.  We hypothesize that the differential anatomical changes in otherwise normal liver in response to radiation therapy of liver tumors can be described via dose-driven expansions/contractions in biomechanical models. Our preliminary data shows that these initial models can predict, a priori, the induced hypertrophy and fibrosis/necrosis/atrophy rates to within a 95% confidence interval in 80% of the cases. The sensitivity of the models to the optimization parameters indicate that additional refinement of the models can further improve this accuracy. The combination of this dose-driven expansion/contraction component of the model with the overall biomechanics describing stiffness and deformation, can facilitate safe dose-escalation to the tumor either in the definitive setting or as a bridge to transplant, enable quantitative assessment of therapy response during therapy and throughout follow up via deformable dose summation of the treatment received, and allow accurate correlation between longitudinal imaging of functional response and the delivered radiation therapy dose. IMPACT: The successful completion of this work will develop metrics to aid in the safe utilization of radiotherapy for the liver, improve correlation of functional imaging with delivered therapy, and, where necessary, enable the safe treatment of subsequent tumors in the liver, should they arise. The full utilization of radiation for liver cancer is limited by uncertainty in the radiation toxicity risk for patients with underlying liver disease and the inability to sum dose in the re-treatment setting due to large anatomical responses to therapy. We hypothesize, with support from preliminary data, that the differential anatomical changes in otherwise normal liver in response to radiation therapy of liver tumors can be described via dose- driven expansions/contractions in biomechanical models.

This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation.

"Development and Validation of Prognostic Radiomic Markers of Response and Recurrence for Patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases SUMMARY Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. More than 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases in their lifetime with a dismal <10% surviving past three years. A major therapeutic problem in this disease is that no markers prognostic of hepatic recurrence or predictive of response prior to treatment are known. The goal of this research is to fill this gap by providing non-invasive and objective prognostic quantitative imaging markers for personalized treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Our single-institution data support that quantitative imaging features extracted from routine CT scans predict volumetric response to systemic and regional chemotherapy and identify patients at high risk of hepatic recurrence and poor survival. Progress in developing these novel markers is limited by a lack of optimization, standardization, and validation, all critical barriers to clinical use. The objectives of this application are to develop and validate robust imaging features by standardizing image acquisition, to improve automated tools for clinical trial use, and to validate the predictive power of imaging features with external data. We have partnered with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and GE Research, facilitating the widespread integration of the proposed technology into medical centers worldwide. Our central hypothesis is that quantitative CT-based imaging features provide novel and robust indices for predicting response, hepatic recurrence, and survival in CRLM patients. Specifically, we will (1) validate predictive and prognostic imaging features with external data, (2) prospectively assess repeatability and reproducibility of contrast-enhanced CT imaging features, and (3) develop an integrated rawdiomics pipeline by fully utilizing sinogram data. We have assembled a critical mass of experts in surgery, medical oncology, pathology, radiology, biostatistics, and image analysis. Combined with the largest clinical experience in CRLM in the western world, this application is a unique and unrivaled opportunity to define radiomics of CRLM. Integration into existing clinical workflows means that small medical centers without highly specialized radiology groups would benefit from predictive algorithms developed at two high-volume centers via a low-cost software update. Successful completion of our aims will provide validated prognostic imaging markers with a pathway to routine clinical use, which are of paramount importance to improving patient survival of this deadly disease.

"Development and Validation of Prognostic Radiomic Markers of Response and Recurrence for Patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases SUMMARY Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. More than 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases in their lifetime with a dismal <10% surviving past three years. A major therapeutic problem in this disease is that no markers prognostic of hepatic recurrence or predictive of response prior to treatment are known. The goal of this research is to fill this gap by providing non-invasive and objective prognostic quantitative imaging markers for personalized treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Our single-institution data support that quantitative imaging features extracted from routine CT scans predict volumetric response to systemic and regional chemotherapy and identify patients at high risk of hepatic recurrence and poor survival. Progress in developing these novel markers is limited by a lack of optimization, standardization, and validation, all critical barriers to clinical use. The objectives of this application are to develop and validate robust imaging features by standardizing image acquisition, to improve automated tools for clinical trial use, and to validate the predictive power of imaging features with external data. We have partnered with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and GE Research, facilitating the widespread integration of the proposed technology into medical centers worldwide. Our central hypothesis is that quantitative CT-based imaging features provide novel and robust indices for predicting response, hepatic recurrence, and survival in CRLM patients. Specifically, we will (1) validate predictive and prognostic imaging features with external data, (2) prospectively assess repeatability and reproducibility of contrast-enhanced CT imaging features, and (3) develop an integrated rawdiomics pipeline by fully utilizing sinogram data. We have assembled a critical mass of experts in surgery, medical oncology, pathology, radiology, biostatistics, and image analysis. Combined with the largest clinical experience in CRLM in the western world, this application is a unique and unrivaled opportunity to define radiomics of CRLM. Integration into existing clinical workflows means that small medical centers without highly specialized radiology groups would benefit from predictive algorithms developed at two high-volume centers via a low-cost software update. Successful completion of our aims will provide validated prognostic imaging markers with a pathway to routine clinical use, which are of paramount importance to improving patient survival of this deadly disease.

"Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation Project Summary/ Abstract Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths with rising incidence in the U.S and worldwide. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization, or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), is a treatment in which a catheter inserted in the patient's hepatic artery delivers radioactive 90Y microspheres to the liver. It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome. Narrative Liver cancer is one the most prevalent type of cancer with deadly outcome in the U.S. and worldwide. It is increasingly treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) but due to severe limitations in treatment planning and dose calculation in particular, the efficacy of SIRT is drastically reduced.

"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin-echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack- of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer.

"LiverTox Drug induced liver injury is an uncommon but important and challenging form of liver disease. When evaluating a patient with new-onset liver disease, drugs, including prescription medications, over-the-counter preparations, vitamins, dietary supplements and herbals, must always be considered as a possible cause. Indeed, the possibility must be entertained even if another cause may seem obvious, such as hepatitis B or C. The reason for this is that drug induced liver injury can be severe and even fatal, but is usually reversed by discontinuation of the offending agent. To continue a medication in the face of drug induced liver injury can have serious consequences.    Drug induced liver injury is a growing challenge because of the ever increasing number of drugs used in medical care and the increasing number of individuals who take them. Among the thousands of drugs available today, several hundred have been linked to liver injury, but the clinical pattern of liver injury is diverse and can mimic almost any form of liver disease. Drug induced liver injury can present in a pattern that is similar to acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, acute liver failure, biliary obstruction, or fatty liver disease. To keep track of which drugs cause liver injury and what pattern is typical of each agent is challenging to even the most dedicated subspecialist in the area. Furthermore, the literature on drug induced liver injury is large and dispersed to publications in many disciplines ¿ pharmacology, internal medicine, hepatology, gastroenterology, pediatrics, and surgery. Publications on drug induced liver disease often appear as short reports or letters to the editor that are difficult to access, including many that appear in foreign language journals that may not be available in local medical libraries.
