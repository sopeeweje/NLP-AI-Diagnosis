"SUPPORT FOR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS COMPUTER The Physiology Computer Research Resource collaborates with biomedical research laboratories at several medical schools supporting laboratory automation.  Collaborating laboratories are investigating:  synaptic input to brainstem respiratory neurons, cutaneous sensory dorsal horn neurons, neural genesis of respiratory rhythm, time-resolved single cell laser spectroscopy, muscle contraction, membrane biophysics, cellular aspects of cardiac defibrillation, neurophysiology, quantitative video intensification microscopy, cardiovascular control and microvasculature.  Collaboration is fostered through the Federated Processor Laboratory Automation System (FPLAS) consisting of hardware and software modules designed, developed, and produced by the Resource.  The ""federated"" nature of this system -- several processing units of equal complexity but differing in their areas of specialization -- is derived from recent insights in parallel computation and bus architecture.  The FPLAS accommodates the demands of the biomedical research instrumentation environment and allows incremental increase in system performance through incorporation of expected semiconductor technology advances.  The modular construction of the system allows these anticipated advances to be incorporated in an incremental fashion while retaining the majority of the existing equipment.  Incremental growth allowed by the FP architecture is particularly important to the biomedical research community because its applications do not constitute a broad enough market to bear the ever escalating development costs which accompany development of new semiconductor devices.  n/a",SUPPORT FOR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS COMPUTER,3103637,P41RR000374,"['artificial intelligence', ' biophysics', ' computer center', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrocardiographic monitor', ' electrophysiology', ' laser spectrometry', ' monitoring device', ' muscle contraction', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurophysiology', ' patient monitoring device', ' physiology', ' semiconduction', ' television', ' ventricular fibrillation']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P41,1987,371541,0.0171041932352131

Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.

"Novel Tools and Principles for Precisely Controlling Brain Activity The finding that many neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with abnormal neural activity in specific brain circuits raises the optimism that a precise, flexible technology for controlling neural activity would enable the systematic treatment of many brain disorders. I here propose to take a top-down approach to developing a new tool for noninvasive, focal, deep-targetable control of brain circuits. I also propose to discover informed principles governing the use of these tools to control activity in a diversity of neural circuits relevant for different illnesses. Through far-reaching collaborations, I will not only invent these tools and discover how to use them, but lead their translation into clinical application. I believe that this is the right time and place to tackle this intellectual challenge, given my unique training, as well as my proven abilities to synthesize new insights from disparate fields, and to lead interdisciplinary teams into new territory.

I also propose to discover informed principles governing the use of these tools to control activity in a diversity of neural circuits relevant for different illnesses. Through far-reaching collaborations, I will not only invent these tools and discover how to use them, but lead their translation into clinical application. I believe that this is the right time and place to tackle this intellectual challenge, given my unique training, as well as my proven abilities to synthesize new insights from disparate fields, and to lead interdisciplinary teams into new territory.",Novel Tools and Principles for Precisely Controlling Brain Activity,7430134,DP2OD002002,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Apomorphine', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Auras', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Body Surface', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cardiac', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Chloride Ion', 'Chlorides', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Chronic', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Conscious', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cosmetics', 'Coupled', 'Creativeness', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dreams', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'England', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Event', 'Expert Opinion', 'Failure', 'Feeling', 'Fiber', 'Figs -

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states.

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses.

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses.

"Characterizing Odor Maps in the Olfactory Bulb and Cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain usefully organizes sensory information by building internal representations of the external world. These internal sensory maps are read by higher neural centers that can trigger learned and innate behaviors, emotions, thoughts and memories. For nearly all animals the most important information in the outside world comes not from sights or sounds but smells - volatile chemical odorants that inform animals about the proximity of food, the availability of appropriate mates or the lurking danger of a nearby predator. The overarching goal of this grant is to identify general principles about how the brain usefully organizes sensory information by specifically exploring the neural wiring that underlies olfaction. Odors are detected within the nose by olfactory sensory neurons, whose axons project to structures in the olfactory bulb called glomeruli. Each glomerulus is a discrete information channel that is innervated by the dendrites of projections neurons whose axons terminate in the higher brain. As olfactory information passes from the sensory epithelia in the nose, through the olfactory bulb, and into the cortex, it is formatted and transformed to enable appropriate behavioral responses. But despite the fact that olfaction is the sensory modality that enables most animals to interact with their environment, we know little about how the olfactory system usefully organizes information within the cortex, in part because to date it has been technically difficult to trace axonal projections from identified glomeruli in the bulb to their targets in the brain. Here we propose to deploy a new method we have developed that enables high-precision targeted labeling of single glomeruli and their associated neurons. We will use this approach to reveal how information about odorants in the environment is transformed as it passes from the olfactory bulb to the cortex (Aim I). We will then use a combination of behavioral analysis, functional imaging, genetics and optogenetics to ask whether the olfactory circuits that are dedicated to driving innate behaviors (such as attraction or avoidance) are segregated from those involved in sensing general odors (Aim II). Taken together this work will reveal the core organizational logic of the olfactory system, suggesting models for how the brain discriminates odors and generates odor-driven learned and innate behaviors. These experiments will also identify neural substrates upon which experience, expectation and emotion - as well as disease - can act to alter perception. Here we propose to deploy a novel neural circuit tracing technique we have developed to reveal how the brain meaningfully organizes sensory information from the outside world to facilitate innate and learned behaviors. We will describe how neural information is formatted and transformed as it flows from the nose, through multiple processing stages, and into the higher brain where behaviors are generated. These experiments will lead to insights into how the architecture of neural circuits influences brain function, thereby improving our understanding of neural physiology and offering a window into how pathological damage might alter information processing and behavior.",Characterizing Odor Maps in the Olfactory Bulb and Cortex,8862449,R01DC011558,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Dendrites', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Electroporation', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Food', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'olfactory sensory neurons', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sound']",NIDCD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,356586,0.07943931406893195

"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.

In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.

The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.

"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6857150,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,358050,0.07214789970567811

Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6708002,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,358050,0.07214789970567811
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts.

"The Circuit Logic of Modulation of Locomotion by Odors 1 There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying even simple naturalistic  2 behaviors, such as making a cup of coffee, which proceed through a sequential execution of sub-behaviors.  3 Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because obtaining a circuit-level understand-  4 ing of complex multi-step behaviors is a necessary step toward unlocking the mysteries of healthy brain func-  5 tion and of disorders. The overarching goal is to obtain a circuit-level understanding of such naturalistic behav-  6 ior. The research objective here is to unravel the logic of sensorimotor transformation in the context of odor-  7 modulation of locomotion in Drosophila. The central hypothesis is that, like many of our own everyday actions,  8 control of odor-modulation of locomotion is hierarchical. A fly’s locomotion is built from simpler elements called  9 locomotor primitives, each of which lasts between 1-3 seconds (or 10-30 steps). Odors, instead of acting on 10 instantaneous locomotor parameters such as speed and angular speed, act on these locomotor primitives and 11 change the probability that the fly spends performing a given locomotor primitive. This hypothesis was formu- 12 lated on the basis of our previous work and preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that 13 understanding odor-guided locomotion—a complex, flexible behavior—in the context of a genetically tractable 14 system will allow a precise delineation of the steps that underlie sensorimotor transformation in the context of a 15 naturalistic behavior.

"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus.

"Ensemble Dynamics of Cortical Feedback to the Thalamus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most compelling and unresolved issues of visual processing is the role of the massive cortical feedback that occurs in a number of sites in the visual system. Activation of this feedback is thought to underlie processes such as attention. It may also serve as a partial solution to the binding problem, which has been proposed to rely on correlated firing in ensembles of neurons. The earliest cortical feedback does not occur in cortex at all, but in the thalamus. Similar to feedback systems in the cerebral cortex, corticothalamic feedback is characterized by extensive reentry of processed data from Layer 6 of cortex to lower processing levels in sensory thalamic nuclei such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We propose to characterize the rules of communication between corticothalamic neurons and their target thalamic relays (e.g., what proportion of cells engage, and what patterns of activity promote this communication?); how might the resulting activity patterns within the thalamus be expressed topographically (e.g., does feedback promote certain types of activity in certain topographic regions and not others?); and how are the differences in these patterns critical in allowing certain kinds of information access to cortex (e.g., thalamic neurons have two firing regimes:  burst and tonic, will these have differing impact at thalamocortical (TC) synapses?). Is information selectively affected in well-known physiological types of neurons? (e.g., ON/OFF, X/Y-like, and/or eye specific information?) To answer these questions, multielectrode arrays will be used to record thalamic ensembles and their ongoing dialog with Layer 6 of cortex. We will test the following hypotheses: (H1) that Layer 6 feedback to the LGN will produce correlations among ensembles of LGN cells that depend upon visuotopic register with spiking Layer 6 neurons; (H2) that LGN cells will preferentially activate Layer 6 neurons under certain firing conditions and activity patterns; and (H3) that brainstem activation will increase correlated firing across LGN neurons in response to Layer 6 feedback. The purpose of corticothalamic interactions is an enduring mystery, but one whose resolution will yield fundamental details of the defining role of feedback in neural systems. In addition to the details of normal corticothalamic processing, our proposed studies will provide a foundation for understanding abnormal thalamic network states in CNS disorders such as epilepsy, chronic pain and Parkinson's disease. Relevance: Information from peripheral sensory systems is processed at ascending stages of the thalamus and cortex. The cortex sends a massive projection back to lower processing levels of the brain, but the function of this feedback is poorly understood. This project proposes the detailed examination of how the cortex may instruct the thalamus to allow certain types of information to proceed to higher processing stages based on specific timing of stimulation or arrangement of objects in space. By recording from large numbers of brain cells in both regions simultaneously, we will discover rules that the regions use to communicate.

These are perturbed in a number of brain disorders, thus the information we will learn about the basic rules of communication is vital for the understanding of these abnormal brain conditions.          n/a",Ensemble Dynamics of Cortical Feedback to the Thalamus,7539153,R21EY018159,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Paralysed', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'brain cell', 'chronic pain', 'computerized data processing', 'corticogeniculate', 'depressed', 'depression', 'expectation', 'information organization', 'information processing', 'interest', 'novel', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory system', 'tool', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2009,148000,0.03287102044937887
"The internal states of neural circuits: data analysis, modeling, and disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive behaviors arise from an interplay between neural activity driven by external stimuli and internal activity patterns or ""brain states"" that relect motivation, intention and experience. Historically, neuroscience re- search has focused almost exclusively on stimulus-driven activity, ignoring the impact of internal state. Clearly, to develop theories of cognitive function and to understand psychiatric illnesses, which are disorders of internal state, a new neuroscience must be developed that measures and models both externally and internally generated neural activity and seeks to reveal the interactions between them. Several significant challenges have prevented the study of internal state. First, to analyze experimental data, it is typical to average across many trials. However, if the internal state differs from trial to trial, this procedure will destroy the state-dependent neural responses in data. Second, internal states may differ from each other only by the way that they process information in time, in other words, by their dynamics. Third, to date, the neuroscience field has no insight into how transitions between internal states arise and remain limited to only occur at appropriate times. This application meets these challenges by offering methods for 1) inferring the transition times between states so that state-specific activity can be elucidated; 2) discovering state-dependent dynamics in experimental data; and 3) determining the mechanisms for maintenance of internal state and transitioning between states. The study of internal state will support the basic neuroscience goal of developing circuit level theories neural computation and cognitive function. However, this application also impinges upon two hypotheses for the development of psychiatric disease and thus may lead to new approaches to diagnosis and treatment. First, illness may develop because state-specific computations have gone awry leading to symptoms such as, in the case of schizophrenia, the misidentification of internally generated spontaneous activity as external stimuli (that is, hallucinations). Second, and completely novel, psychiatric phenomena may arise, not from disordered states per se, but rather from disordered state transitions, or ""transitionopathies"". In obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example, a state associated with a compulsion (for example, the need to check that the door is locked) maybe completely nor- mal, but pathology results from the failure to transition appropriately to a new state. The tools presented in this application will permit the comparison of data between healthy animals and disease models, and thus may give insight into how state-specific computations can fail and lead to disease. Additionally, by exploring potential mechanisms by which transitioning may become disordered, this application may offer insight into the development of transitionopathy. While the analysis methods developed in this application will initially be applied to data from animals, in the future they could be extended toward the analysis of noninvasive measures of brain activity in humans such as fMRI or EEG. If a robust theory of normal and abnormal internal states and state transitioning is developed, such analyses could aid in the diagnosis of psychiatric disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Psychiatric disease can be understood as a failure of normal computation by the neural circuits in the brain. This application seeks to clarify the neuroscience of the interplay between inputs to neural circuits that arise from the external world and internal ""brain states"", and thus will permit the development of robust, circuit-level theories of neural computation. Such theories will complement existing understanding of psychiatric disease, and may lead to fundamentally new approaches to diagnosis and treatment.","The internal states of neural circuits: data analysis, modeling, and disease",9561917,DP5OD019897,"['Affect', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Arousal', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Lead', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'animal data', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'detector', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'microstimulation', 'negative mood', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallelization', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'theories', 'tool']",OD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,DP5,2018,399207,0.008906288359172374

"Cannabinoid Mobilization in Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to enhance the PI's research capability and the skills and interests of her students in neuroscience by having them to participate in the PI's ongoing research in the endogenous cannabinoid system at The University of Texas at Brownsville (an academically diverse 93% Hispanic community). Cannabinoids, the bioactive components in marijuana and hashish, affect the brain by acting at specific receptors, the brain cannabinoid receptors (CB1R). Natural ligands for CB1R are endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs). eCBs are increasingly recognized as critical signaling molecules in many areas of the nervous system because eCBs modulate many important neurobiological phenomena including neurotransmission, memory and learning, reward and motivation, and neuroprotection in diseases, which makes understanding the process of their synthesis a matter of great importance. However, the physiological stimuli that initiate the synthesis of eCBs are not well understood. The goal of this project is to investigate the cellular mechanisms of eCB production. Neuronal depolarization and the depolarization-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]c) produce eCBs, and this production can be bio-assayed in real time by a phenomenon called DSI (depolarization-induced suppression of GABAergic inhibition). The PI's preliminary findings suggest that Ca2+ release from the ryanodine receptor (RyR) determines the magnitude of DSI. From this evidence, it is hypothesized that RyR may be a key molecule that is necessary and sufficient for the production of eCBs in neurons. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: 1) To isolate and characterize RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c signal and determine its role in the eCB production; 2) To identify the cellular localization of RyRs and their anatomical relationships with CB1R; and 3) To determine the roles of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and store-operated Ca2+ entry in the RyR-dependent production of eCBs. Experiments are conducted in cultured hippocampal slices with the techniques of immunohistochemistry, siRNA and eGFP transfection, Ca2+ imaging, and the patch clamp recording. eCBs and their regulation by Ca2+ are topics of great interest to a wide range of biomedical scientists. Thus, the identification of Ca2+ signaling pathways and Ca2+ sensing proteins for the production of eCBs will provide a critical understanding for potent neuronal signaling systems, and open new avenues of investigations for the phenomena ranging from basic synaptic transmission to pathophysiological roles of eCBs. The project also offers a valuable opportunity for students to obtain laboratory research experiences, which undoubtedly raise their awareness in public health and diseases, and aid them in establishing their professional goals in biomedical sciences.       n/a",Cannabinoid Mobilization in Neurons,7365285,R15DA021683,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'CNR1 gene', 'Calcium', 'Calcium ion', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elevation', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hispanics', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Ryanodine Receptors', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Slice', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Writing', 'biomedical scientist', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'concept', 'design', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'hashish', 'interest', 'neuroprotection', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'patch clamp', 'postsynaptic', 'programs', 'receptor', 'research study', 'skills', 'text searching', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIDA,UNIV/TEXAS BROWNSVILLE & SOUTHMOST COLL,R15,2008,192488,-0.01999780682347743
"CRCNS Data Sharing: Exchange and Evaluation of Reduced Neuron Modles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theoretical neuroscientists use neuron models to predict, understand, and explain biological neuron behavior. They often work with ""reduced"" neuron models that abstract away biological details but capture essential neuronal dynamics. This choice facilitates mathematical tractability, conceptual analysis, and computational speed. However, the tradeoffs inherent in using such models (instead of biologically detailed ones) are not transparent. It is often unclear if a model is faithful to essential observed dynamics of the neuron, and if so, under what model parameters and stimulus conditions. It is also rare for multiple types of reduced models to be compared in this regard, making it difficult to select the most appropriate one for a scientific question. Lastly, such models, once developed and parameterized, usually are not shared among researchers in a form that facilitates reproducibility and re-use, nor can they be easily discovered. As a result, status quo behavior in the use of reduced models is often simply to choose a ""favorite"" model regardless of merit, to optimize it for the scientific question at hand, and then to discard it.     A standard practice in professional software development is unit testing. A unit test is a procedure that validates a single component of a computer program against a single correctness criterion. An ongoing effort to develop an analogous unit-testing procedure for neuron models, NeuronUnit, enables the construction of validation tests-executable functions that validate models against a single empirical observation to produce a score indicating agreement between the model and an observation. NeuronUnit facilitates the construction and logical grouping of tests for neuron models, the parameterization of tests using a wide range of empirical data, and the execution of tests against models in a continuous and transparent fashion. Aggregate results provide both theoretical and experimental neuroscientists with an overview of model suitability for targeted research questions. Merits and deficiencies of competing models are clearly visible, benefiting ongoing modeling efforts and informing new theoretical and experimental directions.       This proposal aims to expand NeuronUnit to create data-driven, neuron-type-specific validation tests for reduced models. The ability of a range of reduced models to capture the relevant membrane potential and spiking dynamics of specific biological neuron types in response to specific stimuli, using publicly available experimental data from numerous sources, will be quantitatively tested and visualized. In doing so, the merits and deficiencies of each reduced model-as well as tradeoffs in model complexity, speed, and analysis-become transparent, providing critical information for model choice.      Project aims are to 1) express a large number of reduced models using NeuroML/LEMS, 2) implement NeuronUnit testing of these models against data from a wide range of neuron- and experiment-types, 3) provide web-based search and visualization for test results and corresponding simulations, and 4) make these models available both as NeuroML documents and as code for every NeuroML-supported simulator. Collaborations with multiple existing initiatives will promote uptake of these tools, which for the first time, will provide a rigorous, transparent process for evaluation and selection of reduced models to address scientific questions about neurons.     This project goes beyond model sharing by facilitating the dissemination of information about the performance and applicability of reduced neuron models in the context of specific datasets, complementing the existing dissemination mode of manuscript publication. By making model choice more deliberate and model appropriateness more objective, this work highlights which models should be used to address which scientific questions and why, without the need for a deep literature search (for models and data) or the installation of new tools or re-coding of models for simulation. The project also serves neuroscience educators by providing an interactive platform for visualization of reduced model dynamics accessible to any student, using data from biological neurons.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms.

"Neuronal population coding: from vision to decision Project summary  A very large number of studies have investigated the relationship between the activity of sensory neurons and behavior. The model that implicitly or explicitly guides most of that work is that single neurons are the unit of computation. The underlying hypothesis is that different groupings of neurons are responsible for each sensory, cognitive or premotor role in decision-making. However, each neuron's responses encode a unique combination of sensory and cognitive signals as well as noise, and have distinct interactions with the rest of the network. These observations, combined with the staggering flexibility of mappings from sensory stimuli to actions suggest that different weighted sums of the activity of the entire population may be more informative about sensory and behavioral variables than different groupings of neurons.  This idea represents a new way of thinking about neural coding. It has important implications for the neuronal mechanisms underlying many behavioral processes, including perceptual decision-making in the primate visual system, which is our model system. This paradigm can also explain longstanding paradoxes about the aspects of the neural code that limit performance on perceptual tasks.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the aspects of population activity that guide and gate perceptual decisions. We hypothesize that the sensory information that is used to flexibly guide and gate decisions is shared between populations of visual and premotor neurons. The two cornerstones of our approach are 1) to record simultaneously from groups of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT), which encodes visual motion, and in the superior colliculus (SC), whose responses are visual, oculomotor, and everything in between and 2) to use novel measures of neuronal activity that incorporate the activity of the whole population. In Aim 1, we will compare the extent to which individual perceptual decisions can be predicted from the dominant fluctuations in population responses within MT or the SC or activity that is correlated on a trial by trial basis between the two areas. In Aim 2, we will determine whether task-irrelevant stimulus information, which can cause large changes in the activity of sensory neurons, is filtered out by interactions between MT and the SC. In Aim 3, we will conduct a strong test of the hypothesis that visuo-motor interactions guide perceptual decision-making by measuring the relationship between choices and interactions between MT and SC neurons with receptive fields in opposite hemifields.  Together, these studies will address long-standing questions about the extent to which perception is limited by the fidelity with which stimulus information is encoded in sensory cortex or by the information that is flexibly communicated to downstream areas in a task-dependent way. More generally, this work will establish a set of experimental and data analysis techniques for revealing the relationship between neuronal populations and behavior. Narrative Most neurological diseases including depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are thought to involve networks of neurons in multiple brain areas, but very few studies have focused on how neurons in different areas interact and how these interactions are modulated by task or cognitive factors. Understanding the way that information is encoded and decoded by neuronal populations will be critical for diagnosing and developing drug therapies to treat these diseases.

"Neuronal population coding: from vision to decision Project summary  A very large number of studies have investigated the relationship between the activity of sensory neurons and behavior. The model that implicitly or explicitly guides most of that work is that single neurons are the unit of computation. The underlying hypothesis is that different groupings of neurons are responsible for each sensory, cognitive or premotor role in decision-making. However, each neuron's responses encode a unique combination of sensory and cognitive signals as well as noise, and have distinct interactions with the rest of the network. These observations, combined with the staggering flexibility of mappings from sensory stimuli to actions suggest that different weighted sums of the activity of the entire population may be more informative about sensory and behavioral variables than different groupings of neurons.  This idea represents a new way of thinking about neural coding. It has important implications for the neuronal mechanisms underlying many behavioral processes, including perceptual decision-making in the primate visual system, which is our model system. This paradigm can also explain longstanding paradoxes about the aspects of the neural code that limit performance on perceptual tasks.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the aspects of population activity that guide and gate perceptual decisions. We hypothesize that the sensory information that is used to flexibly guide and gate decisions is shared between populations of visual and premotor neurons. The two cornerstones of our approach are 1) to record simultaneously from groups of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT), which encodes visual motion, and in the superior colliculus (SC), whose responses are visual, oculomotor, and everything in between and 2) to use novel measures of neuronal activity that incorporate the activity of the whole population. In Aim 1, we will compare the extent to which individual perceptual decisions can be predicted from the dominant fluctuations in population responses within MT or the SC or activity that is correlated on a trial by trial basis between the two areas. In Aim 2, we will determine whether task-irrelevant stimulus information, which can cause large changes in the activity of sensory neurons, is filtered out by interactions between MT and the SC. In Aim 3, we will conduct a strong test of the hypothesis that visuo-motor interactions guide perceptual decision-making by measuring the relationship between choices and interactions between MT and SC neurons with receptive fields in opposite hemifields.  Together, these studies will address long-standing questions about the extent to which perception is limited by the fidelity with which stimulus information is encoded in sensory cortex or by the information that is flexibly communicated to downstream areas in a task-dependent way. More generally, this work will establish a set of experimental and data analysis techniques for revealing the relationship between neuronal populations and behavior.

"High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system The Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) proposes to build a high-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system. Two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in behaving animals is important for many projects at Princeton, including several that are part of the U.S. BRAIN Initiative. The technique is being applied to large neural populations distributed across the entire nervous systems of small animals (worm, ?y, or larval zebra?sh), as well as to particular regions of the mouse brain (neocortex, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia). These large-scale observations of neural activity are conducted while the animal is performing complex behaviors such as navigation, decisionmaking, and courtship. The TEM system would add large-scale anatomical information with unprecedented resolution and completeness. The extremely high throughput of the system would make it routine to perform serial section TEM imaging of the entire brain for small animals, or of large brain regions for the mouse. It would be possible to directly relate anatomy and physiology by applying two-photon calcium imaging and TEM to exactly the same neurons. In the past, this combined approach has been hindered by the fact that 3D EM imaging generates a huge amount of data and has taken months or years for even a small volume. The system will be fast enough to produce a petabyte in a few months, enough for a millimeter-scale brain volume. PNI is one of the few places in the world that is ready to handle petascale datasets, as PNI has recently received funding from IARPA to scale up EM image analysis techniques, including deep learning and crowdsourcing. The instrument will be housed in the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics, in the basement of the new PNI building. The Bezos Center already provides two-photon microscopy technologies to laboratories at PNI, and would become an even more important resource with the TEM system. Combined with existing capabilities in two-photon calcium imaging, the MultiSEM will enable the Princeton Neuroscience Institute to relate the structure and function of neural circuits. This should improve our understanding of normal brain function, and aid in understanding brain diseases that are caused by miswired or degenerated neural circuits.",High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system,9494063,S10OD023602,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscope', 'Funding', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Medial', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Zebrafish', 'brain volume', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'instrument', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'petabyte', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'two-photon']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,S10,2018,2000000,0.03452508569392125
"AFFERENT REGULATION OF CHOLINERGIC FOREBRAIN NEURONS The broad objective of this research program is to understand how the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic system (BFC) contributes to specific cognitive operations in anatomically defined circuits. Despite its involvement in cortical activation, attention, and memory, the functional details of the BF are not well understood due to the anatomical complexity of the region. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have a significant decrease of acetylcholine (ACh) in the cortex and show pathological changes in cholinergic neurons in the BF. Thus, a complete understanding of its functional organization is warranted. The central hypothesis of our long- standing anatomical studies is that cholinergic projections to the neocortex are not diffuse, but instead are organized into segregated or overlapping pools of projection neurons. While our earlier model dealt with high density projection volumes only, which represent only about 16-30% of cholinergic projection neurons, we now parcel the whole cholinergic space by classifying local projection patterns. According to these studies, cholinergic cells are segregated into topographical sets of clusters projecting to functionally connected cortical targets. In Specific Aim 1 in various BF locations in ChAT::Cre rats, we will apply systematic small injections of AAV coding for the inhibitory DREADD in order to inhibit of the cholinergic projection group within subregions of BF. We will investigate spatio-temporal EEG changes in response to BF cholinergic inhibiton over large parts of the cortex in order to lend support to our idea that the clusters modulate functionally related cortical regions. In Specific Aim 2 using high-density silicon arrays in the orbitofrontal, visual association cortex and the basal forebrain in ChAT::Cre rats during a touchscreen-based visual discrimination task, we will investigate the dynamic pattern of neural activity with millisecond precision to understand cholinergic-related modulatory changes within an anatomically defined neuronal network during specific behavioral epochs, including cue detection, short-term memory, decision making, and behavioral execution. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will investigate how activity changes over time in the striatal GABAergic-cholinergic–auditory cortical circuits, during an auditory operant conditioning task, in order to understand how changes between cortical map plasticity and electrophysiological profiles of specific striatal and cholinergic neurons relate to cholinergic-dependent auditory plasticity, learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility. The study of the functional organization of the basalo-cortical network and distinct functions of the cholinergic signal at cellular, network and behavior levels will contribute to better understanding of the dysfunction of attention, decision-making, and memory processes, central to the symptoms of Alzheimer's and other forms of cognitive decline. Cholinergic cells, which are widely distributed in the basal forebrain (BF), provide the majority of acetylcholine found in the cerebral cortex. The overall goal of this application is to improve our knowledge of the distinct functions of the cholinergic signal at cellular, network and behavior levels. These studies will ultimately link activity in anatomically defined cholinergic circuits to specific cognitive operations and will facilitate the designing of interventional tools to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's and related disorders.",AFFERENT REGULATION OF CHOLINERGIC FOREBRAIN NEURONS,9889668,RF1NS023945,"['Acetylcholine', 'Acute', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rabies virus', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Silicones', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Visual', 'artificial neural network', 'association cortex', 'basal forebrain', 'base', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'convolutional neural network', 'cortex mapping', 'data access', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'memory process', 'millisecond', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neocortical', 'neural patterning', 'operation', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'touchscreen']",NINDS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,RF1,2020,2889562,0.0068299956979504745
"INFORMATION PROCESSING A new simultaneous experimental and theoretical interdisciplinary approach to study information processing in neuronal networks is suggested.  It combines a detailed electro-morphological study at the cellular level with mathematical analysis using a new tool for the Simulation of Neuronal Networks (SONN) which we plan to develop.  The idea is to consider neurons as a composition of subunits (e.g.,  axonal branch point), each performs specific information processing functions (Parnas and Segev, 1979).  These functional subunits are first characterized experimentally, then analyzed using detailed partial differential equations (P.D.E) models (e.g., Parnas et al., 1986 a, b, c).  Investigating these experimentally based models will eventually allow to abstract the subunits as independent processors or State Machines (S.M), which transform input to output and changes their internal states. SONN will include both P.D.E and the S.M models, the latter will serve to build a whole neuronal network and to analyze its information processing aspects in comparison to the experimental network.  We believe that this approach will help to establish a theoretical framework for connecting biophysical mechanisms to the function of the neural-network and will aid to refine and redefine models in Artificial Intelligence.  The heart ganglion of the lobster is the experimental network we plan to investigate.  The initial modeling will be done with SPICE, a general-purpose electrical network analysis program, which we have adapted for the use of neurobiologists (Segev et al., 1985).

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process.

"Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks Project Summary/Abstract: There is significant current interest in understanding how neurons relate to whole-brain networks and how these networks coordinate to give rise to behavior. We have recently shown that we can decompose Local Field Potential voltage signals recorded from depth electrodes implanted in multiple brain regions into “electrical functional connectomes,” or electomes, which empirically are consistent between individuals in a population and are predictive of behavior. This provides a unique opportunity to use these consistent network properties to anchor and stratify neurons based on their relationship to whole-brain network dynamics, and this approach only uses data that is currently collected or could be collected with minor changes in protocol. This stratification will be consistent across animals, allowing examination of how neurons in different brains relate to whole-brain networks and to behaviors. This will facilitate closer examination of neuron activity by allowing stronger data aggregation across subjects. Neural encoding and decoding models will be required to be faithful at both the individual neuron level and the multi-region voltage dynamic level, constraining neural relationships by known and learned biological properties. This will be accomplished by first building upon our explainable machine learning approach for learning multi-region networks by including historical data to improve the utility of machine learning during pilot studies and creating novel stochastic optimization approaches for real-time mapping of observed data into the networks. Then, we will develop a model capable of embedding neurons into a shared space, where the embedding succinctly reveals how a neuron relates to the electomes. Finally, these vector embeddings will be used to relate neurons to both behavior and the multi-region dynamics in both single-trial and repeated-trial behavioral tasks. Remarkably, a neuron’s embedding and the state of the mesoscale networks can predict the neural encoding a priori to observing behavior and neural firing simultaneously in a new subject. The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how neurons’ action potentials, long considered to be a fundamental unit of information, relate to whole-brain spatiotemporal voltage patterns and behavior. To uncover this relationship, we will develop novel computational methods capable of learning networks that relate voltage signals from multiple brain regions based upon our previously developed explainable machine learning approach. These networks will then be used to stratify neurons into subtypes consistent across a population of subjects to facilitate the statistical aggregation of data to uncover relationships between multiple scale of neural activity and behavior.",Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks,9775689,R01EB026937,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'member', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,280855,0.16169981960541957
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy.

"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions.

We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations.

"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue.

"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue.

"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments. Such approaches to quantify causality is important as medical perturbations of brains, e.g. treatments of epilepsy or depression are aimed at effecting or causing a change in the brain.",Quantifying causality for neuroscience,9775861,R01EB028162,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'optogenetics', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,299106,0.07199820502202676
"Multi-region 'Network of Networks' Recurrent Neural Network Models of Adaptive and Maladaptive Learning The massive neural activity data collected through transformative new technologies present an incredible opportunity in facilitating the mission of the BRAIN Initiative and the wider neuroscience community: to understand brain function. However, the analysis and interpretation of these massive datasets represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuit ensembles. We propose to eliminate this bottleneck through the development of powerful new, scalable multi-region neural network models and analysis tools that will enable discovery of the connectivity and circuit mechanisms within and between brain regions. We will build off of the advantages of, and our prior successes with, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the state-of-the-art for modeling time-varying behaviors. Specifically, we propose to develop and test a new class of multi-region “network of networks” RNNs to model the nested, hierarchical computations occurring across multiple interacting brain regions during complex behavior. These models will provide another advantage over existing models in being trained to match experimental data from the outset, and using the dynamics of learning to reveal effective connectivity, comprising both network structures and communication principles. The entire pipeline—training and testing the multi-region models and analysis steps for real and simulated data—is scalable and modular, enabling our community of collaborators and end-users to reproduce, validate, and even customize it. Finally, the models, methods, and theories developed are aimed as extensible deliverables. They will lead to widely disseminable new extensions for probing the circuit mechanisms of inter-area communication during both functional and dysfunctional states, and bridging together several experimental observations and model systems. The specific aims of the project include a number of critical subprojects focused on: first, developing multi- region RNN models of adaptive learning, initially focusing on the use case of adversity evasion by zebrafish; and second, modeling circuit dysfunctions in maladaptive learning, the use case being learned immobility in the face of inescapable, persistent adversity. Third, in parallel, this project will scale up and expand the range of the multi-region models and tools for inferring effective connectivity to larger, yet less-sampled datasets, and disseminate them to a community of collaborative end-users. The proposed multi-region RNN models and analytical tools have the potential to be widely used in the neuroscience community to dissect features of brain function in both health and disease. Moreover, our resultant theoretical frameworks will have a strong influence on fundamental approaches to understanding neuroscience data and will inform experimental paradigms and drive future data collection. Transformative new technologies now capture neural activity from thousands of single neurons across multiple areas and even whole brains with sub-second resolution. These methods are critical facilitators for the BRAIN initiative and the wider neuroscience community. However, they produce large-scale datasets whose analysis and interpretation represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuits.

"Dissecting distributed representations by advanced population activity analysis methods and modeling Project Summary A central goal of systems neuroscience is to relate behavior to its underlying circuit dynamics. This task is complicated by the complex and circuitous paths along which information flows as it is encoded and processed in the many steps between sensory inputs and motor outputs. Currently, we understand little regarding the organization and dynamics of interactions between brain areas. For example, we do not know the degree to which specific brain areas have separate representations versus when information is encoded jointly across brain areas. Moreover, it is unclear how the joint state of multi-brain area activity relates to behavior. For instance, when animals are trained to discriminate sensory stimuli we know that neural activity differs across multiple areas in trials when an animal makes a behavioral error, but it is not clear whether all the relevant brain areas have such error-related signals on a single error trial or perhaps if the erroneous pattern occurs only in a subset of brain areas, which is then sufficient to generate a behavioral mistake. Recent experimental and theoretical advances have rendered these questions tractable. On the experimental front, new recording and perturbation technologies allow simultaneous monitoring of population activity in multiple brain areas as animals perform a behavioral task with the ability to interfere with activity in specific regions while observing the effect of these perturbed dynamics on other brain areas. From a theoretical perspective, we have begun to make progress distilling dynamic, heterogenous population activity recordings into a quantification of time-varying interactions between brain areas. Here, we will make use of three high quality datasets of multiple brain area recordings and perturbations collected by our experimental collaborators to design analytical approaches to interpret this data. We will first develop statistical metrics of the coordination of activity between brain areas and relate it to behavior. We will then design neural network based dimensionality reduction approaches that capture complex data in more interpretable form and also denoise the data by assimilating and enforcing consistent population dynamics. Finally, we will devise and adapt modeling approaches that turn the statistical descriptors of population activity into mechanistic models of how circuit structure supports these dynamics. In summary, this proposal will reveal a quantitative description of multi-brain area encoding and communication between brain areas as well as lay down testable, predictive hypotheses for the circuit structures that generate these dynamics. Beyond the basic science importance of these questions, the approaches and tools we will develop and disseminate will be broadly applicable across many paradigms in neuroscience and beyond. Project Narrative Sensory information passes through multiple brain areas as it spreads through the brain, interacts with current information processing, affects decision making circuits, and finally leads to behavior. We currently lack both a holistic view of this process and a detailed understanding of the nature of how multiple brain areas interact. Here, we propose to develop analytical techniques that will facilitate interpreting multi-brain area recording and perturbation datasets, which will reveal how brain areas interface with each other and how these interactions shape behavior.",Dissecting distributed representations by advanced population activity analysis methods and modeling,9776022,R01EB028171,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Dimensions', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'base', 'denoising', 'design', 'deviant', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'interest', 'neural network', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,790000,0.03545395158614828
"Image-based modeling of functional connectivity in neural networks at single-cell resolution Project Summary/Abstract Calcium fluorescence imaging has opened unprecedented opportunities to investigate how neurons are wired in circuits that plastically process information in the brain. Recent advances in microscopy and genetically encoded calcium indicators allow us to record in real time the transient rises of intracellular Ca2+ for a large population of neurons during their electrical activity. However, little is known about mechanisms of information processing in neural circuits at the single neuron level. Even though cutting-edge technologies are capable of optically probing thousands of neurons firing in relation to stimulation or behavior output, we are still unable to track the propagation of the neuron firing events. The key barrier to progress is the lack of computational technologies in image and signal processing for the calcium imaging data. A common but unresolved obstacle to collect calcium activities of neurons from acquired images is deformation of live tissues during imaging. The goal of the project for image processing is to develop an algorithm to automatically extract accurate traces of single-neuron activity from deforming 3D calcium images. A new approach under development generates a dynamic region-of-interest for each jittering and blinking neuron by iteratively learning neuronal identities from local images of firing neurons. As a next step, the goal for signal processing is to develop statistical inference frameworks that can assess the evidence of information flows from external stimuli to sensory neurons, and between interconnected neurons. The responsiveness of neurons upon stimulation will be statistically determined based on an autoregressive hidden Markov model. We will identify causal hierarchy among neuronal activities using Granger-causality inference, in order to reconstruct the functional connectivity networks for large-scale neuronal populations. Subsequent graph theoretical quantification of the connectivity networks at the single-neuron level will enable us to differentiate wiring architectures of neural circuits under different molecular conditions. The long-term career goal of the candidate, Dr. Noh, is to establish an independent research program specialized in image-based stochastic modeling of dynamic nervous systems by translating his expertise in statistics and time series analysis. The training objective of this proposal is to allow Dr. Noh to make a unique contribution to computational methods for complex neuroimaging data and its dynamics, and to train Dr. Noh to gain the ability to conduct hypothesis-driven research for neuroscience by himself. The proposed training is guided by Gaudenz Danuser and Julian Meeks, who are leaders in the fields of computational cell biology and neurobiology, respectively. Being engaged in diverse environment of informatics/experiments and neurobiology, Dr. Noh will immerse himself into neuroscience, acquire experiential learning of neuroimaging experiments, and gain expertise in multidisciplinary team science. The completion of this proposal will enable Dr. Noh not only to establish his groundwork for research in neuroimaging, but also to play leading roles in multidisciplinary research. Project Narrative This project develops computational methods to analyze calcium fluorescence imaging data which display thousands of neurons firing and communicating with each other in live tissues or brain of animals. After redesigning the mathematical methods employed for analyzing dynamic economic quantities, we track propagation of the neuronal firing events to better understand brain function. The methods under development will enable researchers to decode collective calcium activities and understand wiring patterns of individual neurons in neural circuits from the calcium imaging data, and consequently it will help us early detect neurological diseases.",Image-based modeling of functional connectivity in neural networks at single-cell resolution,10054899,K25EB028854,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accessory Olfactory Bulbs', 'Active Learning', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'reproductive', 'response', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vomeronasal organ']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,128358,0.18303435232285287
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,600000,0.12413284373283591
"Connecting neural circuit architecture and experience-driven probabilistic computations Project Summary: Organisms' actions and decisions are guided by experience. Models of such behavior often appeal to the formalism of probabilistic inference, in which expectations about the world build up sequentially due to past observations. These models can account for typical response patterns of subjects performing cog- nitive tasks. However, a theory grounded in biophysical principles of neural circuit architecture and activity is lacking. Our proposal seeks to ﬁll this gap by constructing mechanistic neural circuit models of probabilistic infer- ence, which we will validate using innovative computational tools for matching the statistics of neural population recordings and subject behavior to the outputs of high-dimensional models.  Our proposed work will address several outstanding questions concerning how neural circuits are guided by experience. Neural architecture likely plays a role in the brain's probabilistic computations, but there is not yet a clear theory of this connection. We propose that plasticity-driven changes in neural circuit architecture underlie these computations by reshaping the probability space of neural activity patterns. Neural activity is therefore biased to encode more likely beliefs, in light of experience. Our framework demonstrates this clearly using innovative mathematical methods to extract the low-dimensional activity dynamics of neural circuits subject to plasticity with various timescales. This approach will be applied to interpret our collaborators' data from subjects performing tasks in which they must estimate a remembered variable after a time delay.  Theory is also lacking concerning how dynamics of neural activity represent variables that relevant to a cog- nitive tasks spanning multiple timescales. Most studies consider cleanly structured networks or purely random networks, producing fairly stereotypical neural population activity patterns. We will test the computational capa- bilities of plastic networks with mixed structured and random connectivity, focusing on how the resulting neural population dynamics represent remembered variables. Our neural circuit models will be validated and parame- terized using statistics of (a) neural populations recorded using multielectrodes in non-human primates and (b) subjects' behavioral responses. Our neural circuit models, software and tools used for ﬁtting our models, and data used to validate will be shared widely as a tool kit for use by the broader research community. Project Narrative: Humans have a remarkable capacity for adapting to and learning from experience, but these abilities can be disrupted by neurological disorders, aging, and brain trauma. To determine how best to treat pathologies that damage neural systems underlying learning, it is important to develop physiologically-grounded neural circuit models of how these systems function. The proposed research will develop a theory and tool kit for understanding how neural circuit architecture shapes such behavior using a combination of large-scale modeling, mathematical and computational analysis, and statistical analysis for neural population data.",Connecting neural circuit architecture and experience-driven probabilistic computations,10007281,R01EB029847,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive task', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical methods', 'nervous system disorder', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,650000,0.08985860321012835
"Relating structure and function in synapse-level wiring diagrams Project summary: Modern electron-microscopy (EM) imaging and analysis methods now permit the comprehensive reconstruction of all neurons and synapses in large volumes of brain tissue or the entire brains of individual organisms. However, relating this structure to function is difficult. The rapidly increasing scale of these datasets requires the develop- ment of new quantitative techniques to address this challenge. This proposal describes a combined data analysis and modeling approach that is informed by large-scale EM datasets collected by our experimental collaborators. The methods we will develop extend the state of the art by incorporating multiple sources of information about neuronal connectivity and function to explain structure in EM wiring diagrams. They also leverage recent advances in recurrent neural network optimization to use this structure to constrain models of neural dynamics. Our aim is both to develop general and scalable techniques to be used on the latest generation of datasets, as well as apply these techniques to specific scientific questions about the organization of the Drosophila mushroom body, which is a primary target of current reconstruction efforts. Specific aims of the project include a number of subgoals, starting with the development of techniques to determine the organizing principles of neuronal wiring given a connectivity graph defined by an EM dataset. Unlike standard methods, we aim to leverage multiple modalities of information; for instance, connectivity, cell types, functional data, spatial location, and synaptic weights, to perform this inference. Next, we will perform an analysis of the mushroom body of the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain, a center for associative learning in insects. This analysis will both inform the development of our methods and also address fundamental scientific questions about the nature of stimulus representations in mushroom body Kenyon cells and the circuitry involved in learning. Strong parallels between the organization of the mushroom body and the mammalian cerebellum suggest that these efforts will lead to generalizable insights. Finally, we will integrate structural information with modeling of neural dynamics. We will characterize to what extent structure can be used to build well-constrained models, validating our approaches on datasets that involve characterization of connectivity through EM and recording of neural activity through calcium imaging. The proposed methods will be of interest for researchers working across many model organisms for which EM reconstruction efforts have been completed or are currently underway. We expect that the methods will provide a template for integrating structural information into modeling efforts across these varied systems. Project narrative: Modern electron-microscopy imaging and analysis methods now permit the comprehensive reconstruction of all neurons and synapses in large volumes of brain tissue or the entire brains of individual organisms. Such re- constructions provide the most detailed view to date of neural connectivity, but new techniques are required to identify meaningful structure in and model neural processing using these large datasets. Litwin-Kumar’s group is developing analysis methods to address these problems and link the intricate connectivity of neural circuits to behavior.",Relating structure and function in synapse-level wiring diagrams,10006999,R01EB029858,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Experimental Models', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'data modeling', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiple datasets', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,176110,0.06038662102432377
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders.

"VOR LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND NEURONAL PLASTICITY The fundamental issue underlying this proposal is the mechanism  responsible for associative learning in mammals.  Two of the most  successful model systems today involve adaptions of the vestibulo-ocular  reflex (VOR) and classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane  response (NMR).  This proposal seeks to significantly extend our  understanding of associative learning mechanisms by an in-depth  computational and neurophysiological analysis of VOR and its adaptation  in the cat combined with an effort to bridge the conceptual gap between  this model system and NMR conditioning.  Three key questions will be  explored:    1.  Can a computational model of neural function constrained by known  physiology, account for the currently described behavior as well as serve  as a heuristic tool in directing further experimentation? This defines  a bottom-up approach which has not been utilized on this scale previously  in analyzing a specific response system.  Our prior modeling work in this  project.  These predictions include identification of: a) likely  anatomical site for learning to take place and b) a physiological  substrate for the ""teacher"" signal in a supervised learning algorithm  used to represent reflex plasticity.    2.  What is the precise nature of the changes which take place at the  single neuron level which ar responsible for the development of motor  learning?  A two-prong approach to help answer this critical questions  is proposed.  First, an in-depth characterization of the changes in the  spatial characteristic of neurons crucial to expression of the VOR will  be conducted. Second, u sing stimulation and lesion techniques the nature  of the training signal responsible for guiding plasticity in the reflex  will be explore.    3.  Can mechanisms accounting for both VOR adaption and classical  conditioning of the NMR be unified under a single learning scheme?  Different ways in which to map the VOR adaption paradigm to a classical  conditioning paradigm will be explored.  A clear demonstration of VOR  adaptation development under conditions defined by classical conditioning  would lead the way to unifying these two significant bodies of  investigation into associative learning mechanisms.    The benefits of a clear understanding of how the brain express  associative learning are enormous form a societal viewpoint; from better  recovery of function in stroke patients, to improvements in the  behavioral capabilities of the mentally retarded to, potentially, an  improvement in the ability of our society, as a whole, to increase its  intellectual capacities.  n/a",VOR LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND NEURONAL PLASTICITY,2269743,R29NS031805,"['association learning', ' brain electrical activity', ' cats', ' computational neuroscience', ' electrophysiology', ' electrostimulus', ' eye movements', ' model design /development', ' neural plasticity', ' nictitating membrane', ' vestibuloocular reflex']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R29,1995,93701,-0.005072206458384891

"HIGH SPEED DIGITAL RECORDER FOR ACQUIRING ELECTROPHYSIOL Investigating individual neurons has proven very useful in understanding         their functionality.  However, all biological systems are composed of a          multitude of neurons that interact-with a variety of sensory and skeletal        muscular systems.  Researchers are anxious to have the ability to record         a large number of neuron firing patterns to study how they communicate           and interact in a biological system.  Tools such as the multi-channel            electrode have been created to study the interactions of large numbers           of neurons.  However, in order to record all the channels, the researcher        must gang several recorders together.  This leads to difficulties in             accurately matching all the channels during playback, because of the             complexity of ganged multiple recorders. R.C - Electronics Inc. proposes         to build a low cost, high speed digital recorder utilizing PC technology.        This digital recorder will be able to record continuously to a mass              storage device at an aggregate rate of 1 MHz.  It will also provide the          researcher with the ability to acquire up to 96 channels, with each              channel sampled at 10 KHz; higher speeds will be possible with fewer             channels.                                                                                                                                                         PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is a market demand for the               digital recorder in the multitude of life science applications engaged           in complex biological system studies.   We also believe that this will           be a good industrial recorder, capable of replacing the existing analog          and DAT recorders for acoustic, noise. and vibration studies.  There will        also be a market to replace some of the high-end work stations based on          HP, Concurrent and Sun data acquisition systems.                                  n/a",HIGH SPEED DIGITAL RECORDER FOR ACQUIRING ELECTROPHYSIOL,2445836,R44NS033807,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' electrophysiology', ' personal computers']",NINDS,"R.C.

"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining. This will require the design and implementation of novel neuroinformatics tools for data handling and integration, and their distribution to the wider neuroscience community.         n/a",Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology,7233290,R01NS039600,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,61912,0.06768742671473268
"DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS This proposal seeks funding for a newly established Center for Complex Systems at Florida ATlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.  The main scientific goal of the Center is to understand how a complex biological system containing very many degrees of freedom (e.g. neurons, muscles, vascular processes) generates ordered behavior or macroscopic, spatiotemporal patterns.  This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.  n/a",DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS,3382280,R01MH042900,"['artificial intelligence', ' biological information processing', ' biological models', ' biophysics', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' robotics']",NIMH,FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY,R01,1991,232904,0.0023326828269710264

This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.  n/a",DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS,3382277,R01MH042900,"['artificial intelligence', ' biological information processing', ' biological models', ' biophysics', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' robotics']",NIMH,FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY,R01,1988,199415,0.0023326828269710264

"MODELS FOR LEARNING MEMORY AND INFERENCE All animals show some form of learning, but the range, sublety and pervasiveness of human learning is the main thing that sets human beings apart from other species.  How does the nervous system work to produce learning?  There are two ways to approach this problem:  bottom up, and top down.  The bottom-up approach begins with the properties of individual neurons and synapses and aims to understand complex learning through exhaustive analysis of simple neural circuits and simple learning processes.  This approach is being applied very successfully to elementary learning in several invertebrate species, but it is still a long way from the complexities of learning in higher animals.  A complementary alternative is the top down approach, which underlies the work here proposed.  The top-down method is to begin with careful behavioral analysis of apparently complex tasks that can nevertheless be reduced to simple performance rules.  Theoretical analysis can often suggest formal real-time models that behave in the ways described by a given performance rule.  A dynamic model of this sort that survives rigorous behavioral testing is likely to reflect enduring and measurable properties of the underlying neural machinery.  We have found a very simple class of performance rules, the value-transfer hypothesis, that may underlie animals' ability to solve a ""reasoning"" task, transitive inference.  We have also proposed a very simple dynamic model for the assignment-of-credit problem in operant conditioning, that is, the process by which a response is selected by consequential reinforcement. And most recently we have discovered a simple way to produce sequence learning in a recurrent ""neural"" network.  The proposal describes additional experimental tests of the value-transfer hypothesis, and theoretical explorations of learning systems built out of the assignment- of-credit model and different forms of neural network.

"ELUCIDATING CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS Central pattern generators drive rhythmic behaviors such as walking, chewing and flying.  While they have been intensively studied, the underlying mechanisms are as yet not well understood.  The long term objective of this search is to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the behavior of central pattern generators, in particular, the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG).  Our approach is twofold: We will complement experimental investigation with modeling.  Currently, there are a myriad of cell physiology parameters that could be incorporated into a model of circuit behavior (Selverston, 1988).  By building simplifying models of the gastric mill portion of the STG, our goal is to determine which physiological parameters am necessary to account for the behavior, and which are peripheral to that explanation.  My approach is to start with a minimal set, try to account for normal oscillatory behavior, and add properties as they appear necessary for accounting for more behavior.  The modeling work also raises experimental questions which need to be answered to inform, constrain and validate the model.  The modeling goals are: 1) Extend our current model with further constraints: We now can incorporate gap junctions, delay, and intrinsic currents in the model.  We will use actual data to train the model instead of artificially produced sine wave data to further constrain it.  2) Explore the ability of the model to predict cell properties where not every cell is known.  This is known in other fields as a systems identification task.  If successful this could be extremely useful technique for identifying circuit components that are inaccessible experimentally.  3) Investigate hypotheses regarding constraints concerning functional constraints on the form of circuit.  4) Investigate the relationship between weights and phase relationships.  5) Investigate analytical methods such as bifurcation theory and models of relaxation oscillators to understand the mathematical aspects of our model.  These modeling experiments require more data than is currently available. following biological experiments as planned: 1) Obtain better synaptic strength and electrotonic coupling estimates under normal and neuromodulated conditions.  2) Obtain a better estimate of the input/output function and intrinsic currents of a single neuron under different conditions. 3) Determine the effect of perturbations caused by cell kills and hyperpolarization on the output of the gastric mill. 4) Determine the changes m non-spiking oscillations following exposure to putative neuromodulators.  n/a",ELUCIDATING CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS,3386723,R01MH046899,"['acetylcholine', ' action potentials', ' animal tissue', ' artificial intelligence', ' autonomic ganglion', ' biological models', ' brain regulatory center', ' cholecystokinin', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' cytolysis', ' gap junctions', ' membrane potentials', ' microelectrodes', ' motor neurons', ' neural conduction', ' neural information processing', ' neural inhibition', ' neuromuscular transmission', ' oscillography', ' pyloric region', ' single cell analysis', ' stomach', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R01,1993,88191,0.07097359641719635

"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly).

"CONTROL OF SENSORY ACQUISITION IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH The long-term objective of this research is to gain an understanding of  neural mechanisms and information processing principles involved in sensory  acquisition in vertebrate sensory systems.  The research is focused on those aspects of sensory processing in which  the nervous system actively influences the content and quality of  incoming sensory information.  In general, the neural mechanisms under  investigation fall into two categories, those involved in the control of  filtering properties in sensory processing pathways (adaptive signal  processing aspects) and those involved in the active positioning of  peripheral sensory structures (motor control aspects).  The research  proposed here will investigate both adaptive signal processing and motor  control aspects of sensory acquisition in the electrosensory system of  the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhyncus (brown ghost knife  fish).  Adaptive signal processing studies will explore the neural  mechanisms involved in the descending modulation of stimulus filtering  properties in the first-order electrosensory nucleus (the electrosensory  lateral line lobe, or ELL).  Motor control studies will quantify the  behavioral strategy use by these fish when carrying out electrosensory  discrimination tasks.  The research approach relies heavily on computer  modeling and simulation techniques to elucidate underlying neural  mechanisms.  Biologically-detailed computer simulations of electrosensory  processing will be constructed, including:  (1) finite-element  simulations of peripheral electrical image formation, (2) time-domain  models of primary afferent response dynamics, (3) compartmental models of  ELL pyramidal cells, and (4) network models of electrosensory processing  in the ELL.  In vivo single-unit recordings from primary afferents and  first-order electrosensory neurons will be carried out to guide and  constrain the development of the computer models.  These experiments will  involve quantifying the threshold, gain, and time-domain response  properties of primary afferents and the gain and spatiotemporal tuning  properties of pyramidal cells in the ELL.  The behavior of weakly  electric fish performing electrosensory discrimination tasks will be  recorded on videotape and subsequently analyzed to extract information  about the control of body position and velocity during sensory  acquisition.  Spatiotemporal patterns of afferent activation will be  reconstructed and compared with the spatiotemporal tuning properties of  first-order electrosensory neurons.  Stochastic optimal estimation theory  will be used to test the hypothesis that the stimulus filtering  accomplished by the primary afferents and first-order electrosensory  neurons is near-optimal for extracting estimates of the size and location  of nearby objects from the electrical images generated on the fish's body  surface.  n/a",CONTROL OF SENSORY ACQUISITION IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH,2248766,R29MH049242,"['Osteichthyes', ' action potentials', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' artificial intelligence', ' biophysics', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' electric field', ' electrophysiology', ' electrostimulus', ' fish electric organ', ' histology', ' image processing', ' ion transport', ' lateral line', ' mathematical model', ' neural conduction', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' predation', ' pyramidal cells', ' sensorimotor system', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory mechanism', ' sensory signal detection', ' sensory thresholds', ' somatic afferent nerve', ' somesthesis', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R29,1995,94791,0.013125557162867727

In vivo single-unit recordings from primary afferents and first-order electrosensory neurons will be carried out to guide and constrain the development of the computer models.  These experiments will involve quantifying the threshold, gain, and time-domain response properties of primary afferents and the gain and spatiotemporal tuning properties of pyramidal cells in the ELL.  The behavior of weakly electric fish performing electrosensory discrimination tasks will be recorded on videotape and subsequently analyzed to extract information about the control of body position and velocity during sensory acquisition.  Spatiotemporal patterns of afferent activation will be reconstructed and compared with the spatiotemporal tuning properties of first-order electrosensory neurons.  Stochastic optimal estimation theory will be used to test the hypothesis that the stimulus filtering accomplished by the primary afferents and first-order electrosensory neurons is near-optimal for extracting estimates of the size and location of nearby objects from the electrical images generated on the fish's body surface.  n/a",CONTROL OF SENSORY ACQUISITION IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH,2248765,R29MH049242,"['Osteichthyes', ' action potentials', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' artificial intelligence', ' biophysics', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' electric field', ' electrophysiology', ' electrostimulus', ' fish electric organ', ' histology', ' image processing', ' ion transport', ' lateral line', ' mathematical model', ' neural conduction', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' predation', ' pyramidal cells', ' sensorimotor system', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory mechanism', ' sensory signal detection', ' sensory thresholds', ' somatic afferent nerve', ' somesthesis', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R29,1994,91077,0.013125557162867727
"CONTROL OF SENSORY ACQUISITION IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH The long-term objective of this research is to gain an understanding of neural mechanisms and information processing principles involved in sensory acquisition in vertebrate sensory systems. The research is focused on those aspects of sensory processing in which the nervous system actively influences the content and quality of incoming sensory information.  In general, the neural mechanisms under investigation fall into two categories, those involved in the control of filtering properties in sensory processing pathways (adaptive signal processing aspects) and those involved in the active positioning of peripheral sensory structures (motor control aspects).  The research proposed here will investigate both adaptive signal processing and motor control aspects of sensory acquisition in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhyncus (brown ghost knife fish).  Adaptive signal processing studies will explore the neural mechanisms involved in the descending modulation of stimulus filtering properties in the first-order electrosensory nucleus (the electrosensory lateral line lobe, or ELL).  Motor control studies will quantify the behavioral strategy use by these fish when carrying out electrosensory discrimination tasks.

"CRCNS: Reward and motivation in neural networks  The overall goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) theory of motivation, understood here as motivational salience, and to test the conclusions of this theory using experimental observations obtained in the ventral pallidum (VP). Animals' actions depend on the shifting values of internal demands determined by physiological or behavioral conditions, such as thirst, hunger, addiction, specific nutrient deficiency, etc. These need-based modulations of the perceived values of reinforcements (reward or punishment} are described by a mathematical variable called motivational salience or, simply, motivation. Including motivation adds a new level of complexity to RL theory, and allows it to generate flexible ongoing behaviors. Here, we will investigate how motivation can be learned by neuronal networks to generate complex adaptive behaviors and compare the conclusions of our theory with the VP circuits. Previous studies indicate that the VP plays an important role in a variety of behaviors, potentially, by influencing motivational salience. In vivo recordings suggest that VP neuron firing correlates with motivational states. Lesions, pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations in VP cause profound changes in behaviors motivated by natural rewards or drugs of addiction. Dysfunction of this structure is linked to depression and drug addiction in humans. Our theoretical results suggest that distinct classes of neurons in the VP should play essential roles in representing either positive or negative motivational states. We further hypothesize that the functional interactions locally within the VP are critical for generating such signals that guide motivated behaviors. Consistent with predictions of RL theory, in our preliminary studies, we found that individual VP neurons could be classified as either positive or negative 'motivation neurons', as the activities of these neurons represented both expected values of outcomes and motivational states. When population activity is considered, representations of outcome expectation can be distinguished from representations of motivation fluctuating according to the animals' physiological states. Based on the preliminary data, we devised an integrated approach, combining studies in computational analysis and theory (Koulakov lab) with advanced molecular genetic tools, optogenetics, chemogenetics, electrophysiology, and imaging in behaving mice (Li lab), to test our hypotheses through the following Aims: Aim 1. To develop methods for identifying motivation in the population activity of VP neurons.

"Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease In early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only specific types of neurons are affected by pathological lesions. As the disease progresses, additional neurons types gradually start expressing signs of pathology and degeneration throughout the brain. A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective neuronal vulnerability. Neurons from the layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the most vulnerable neurons of the brain, but there are currently no in vitro culture system for these neurons, preventing both an in-depth analysis of genes involved in neuronal vulnerability, and the search for drugs inhibiting early neurodegeneration affecting these neurons. In the parent RF1 grant, we proposed to identify transcription factors (TFs) involved in specifying ECII neuron identity, using both detailed molecular profiles for ECII and control neurons, which we generated at different points of their development, and cutting-edge functional genomics analyses. These TFs will then be used to drive the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into ECII neurons. While iPSCs provide a versatile platform that can be differentiated into many different neuron types, concerns have been raised that neurons derived from iPSCs are biologically very young, as the iPSC generation protocol “resets” the biological clock of a cell. AD-associated lesions are age-dependent, and we think that an in vitro paradigm adapted to this study of aging is crucial. In this administrative supplement, we thus want to adapt this iPSC protocol for the direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts, using the TFs identified in the parent grant. Directly reprogrammed fibroblasts are not reset biologically and present a biological age that correlates with the age of the fibroblast donor. After having optimized a protocol for direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into ECII neurons, we will provide a proof of concept that these ECII neurons are a good model for probing selective neuronal vulnerability by studying Tau pathology in neurons reprogrammed from fibroblasts of aging donors and of donors with AD mutations. Overall these ECII neurons directly reprogrammed from fibroblasts would be the first in vitro model for the study of the interplay between selective neuronal vulnerability in AD and aging. In Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), only certain regions of the brain are initially affected, followed later by more wide-ranging degeneration. In our parent grant, we proposed to establish the first cell culture system to model the neurons that are most vulnerable in AD, using stem cells. It was recently shown that culture systems involving stem cells generate cells that are young biologically, and not perfectly suited for the study of age- associated degeneration. We now propose to modify our initial protocol using “fibroblast direct reprogramming”, a protocol that does not involve stem cells, and that yields cells than can be biologically much older. This cell culture system would allow AD researchers to investigate, for the first time, the interaction between age and neuronal vulnerability to AD.",Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease,9791605,RF1AG054564,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cells', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research Personnel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stem cells', 'Study models', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'aged', 'entorhinal cortex', 'functional genomics', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mutant', 'neurofibrillary tangle formation', 'overexpression', 'parent grant', 'presenilin-1', 'prevent', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tau Proteins', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor S-II', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,423750,-0.029598318108494726
"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.  Our proposal, in summary, is to extend existing work in parallel        discrete event simulation (PDES) and integrate it with existing work on          compartmental modeling environments, to produce a software environment which     has comprehensive support for modeling large scale, highly structured            networks of biophysically realistic cells; and which can efficiently exploit     the full range of parallel platforms, including the largest parallel             supercomputers, for simulation of these network models, which integrate          information about the nervous system from sub-cellular to the whole-brain        level.  Because of the scale of the models needed at this level of               integration, advanced parallel computing is required.  The critical              technical insight upon which this work rests is that neuronal modeling at        the systems level can often be reduced to a form of discrete event               simulation in which single cells are node functions and voltage spikes are       events.                                                                                                                                                           Three neuroscience modeling projects, will mold, test, and utilize these new     capabilities in investigations of system-level models of the nervous system      which integrate behavioral, anatomical and physiological data on a scale         that exceeds current simulation capabilities.

"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.

"ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING CORTICAL DYNAMICS DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  Visuomotor integration         depends on a remarkable coherence among a number of interrelated                 subprocesses such as pattern recognition, pattern discrimination, decision       to move, and guidance of movement.  The brain is able to integrate these         elementary cognitive processes by coordinating the activities of diverse         neural structures in the face of continuously varying processing demands.        The question of how this coordination operates is central to understanding       the neural basis of visuomotor function.  This proposal aims to develop new      analytical tools to investigate the coordinated activity of distributed          neuronal ensembles in the cerebral cortex of humans and non-human primates       performing simple visuomotor tasks.  It is motivated by recent theoretical       developments (Bressler 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997) predicting a general          cortical mechanism allowing the flexible large-scale functional coordination     of interacting neuronal ensembles.  Hypotheses concerning this mechanism         will be tested by analysis of field potential data recorded at NIMH from         macaque monkeys performing a visuomotor pattern recognition task.  The           challenge is to develop and test new analytic approaches that characterize       the multiple, complex interactions of large-scale distributed cortical           networks.  Earlier analysis of a small portion of this NIMH data set,            reported in Nature in 1993, revealed shifting patterns of multi-site             cortical synchronization during visuomotor processing, and implicated            synchronization in the formation of functional relations within and between      cortical areas.  Standard pairwise techniques were employed to measure           synchronization between field potential signals.  Here, novel methods of         time-series analysis are proposed that go beyond the simple detection of         network interactions.  Advances in signal processing technology will be          utilized to also derive multi-site interaction patterns, to analyze the          dependencies of functional relations on particular groups of neurons, and to     measure the flow of information between cortical regions.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,0.03774841107823342
"TIMING AND LEARNING IN IN VITRO CORTICAL NETWORKS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to tell time, predict the movement of other animals, and decode complex temporal patterns- such as those in speech-are among the brain's primary functions. As such, we would put forth that it will not be possible to understand the fundamental principles underlying brain function without understanding how the brain tells time and processes temporal information. We have proposed that precisely because timing is such a fundamental component to brain function that neural circuits in general are capable of processing temporal information-that is, timing does not rely on specialized or centralized circuits. This theory posits that timing emerges from the neural dynamics of recurrent neural circuits, and predicts that even neural circuits in vitro may be able to learn to tell time.  We hae recently provided evidence that timing is a general computation of cortical networks. Specifically, by chronically exposing slices in the incubator to patterned stimuli (mimicking sensory experience) we have shown that the neural dynamics reproduces the temporal features of the experienced stimuli. Here we will use novel electrical and optogenetic methods to demonstrate that cortical circuits in vitro can ""learn"" temporal patterns, and elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms of timing and cortical computations. We propose that studying network-level forms of learning in reduced preparations is necessary to understand cortical computations because of the limitations of in vivo studies. Additionally, the ability to study network behavior and `learning' in vitro will provide a means to study pathological circuit level computations using tissue from animal models of cognitive disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to tell time and process temporal information is of fundamental importance to sensorimotor processing and learning. Yet, relatively little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to tell time, and it is increasingly clear that this represents a bottleneck for our understanding of the neural basis of learning, behavior, and neurological disorders. Thus elucidating both normal and pathological brain function will require that we unveil the mechanisms that allow the brain to tell time.

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task.

"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10041102,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,106190,-0.07876029184055916
"CRCNS: Age-related changes to cortical dynamics underlying working memory Normal aging in primates often leads to impaired cognitive function, particularly in working memory (WM), which begins to decline in middle-age. Cognitive changes correlate with structural and functional changes to neurons and white matter pathways in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area that is a key player in WM. However, we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how the changes at the single-cell and pathway level impact network function and thus WM performance. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex is only one node in a distributed network of brain regions that contributes to WM, and aging also alters these other –particularly fronto-parietal and visual– areas and long-range inter-areal connections. The central goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying WM as well as the age- related changes to this executive function in the rhesus monkey model of normal aging. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that WM arises through coordinated interaction of visual and fronto-parietal brain regions, and that aging-related decline in WM results from changes to both local circuit dynamics and inter-area communication. Our interdisciplinary approach will combine psychophysical, anatomical and physiological experiments with theory and computational modeling, taking advantage of the complementary expertise of the collaborating laboratories. The proposed research has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify aging effects on individual neurons, white matter pathways and resting state fMRI activity in fronto-parietal and visual cortices. Aim 2: Develop a multi-area computational neural network model in which WM function emerges from interacting distributed circuits. Aim 3: Model-based interpretation and experimental validation of the neuronal mechanisms underlying age-related WM decline.  Public health relevance related to the NIA mission: This project will reveal mechanisms underlying WM and selective age-related changes to WM due to neuronal dysfunction and predict mechanisms that may compensate for these changes to restore function at the cellular, circuit and cognitive level and the quality of life. It thus has broad implications for strategies to enhance brain function in the rapidly increasing population of normally aging individuals. Unique to this proposal is our use of state-of-the-art multiscale anatomical, physiological, and computational approaches in behaviorally characterized rhesus monkeys. These data are critically needed for targeted therapies to prevent detrimental structural and functional brain changes in normal aging. Public distribution of these data will also provide a unique and invaluable resource for the neuroscience community supported by the NIA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project addresses the mission of the NIA -to enhance the understanding of mechanisms of cognitive aging and the quality of life of our aging population– by studying the mechanisms of changes to cognitive function in rhesus monkeys. Through a detailed interrogation of the intricate web of brain changes associated with cognitive decline together with sophisticated computational modeling, this project will provide unique data needed for targeted approaches to enhance the brain health, vitality and productivity of aging individuals.",CRCNS: Age-related changes to cortical dynamics underlying working memory,10153002,R01AG071230,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Interneurons', 'Laboratories', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nodal', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain health', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'functional restoration', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'middle age', 'neocortical', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spectrograph', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'validation studies', 'white matter']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,179837,-0.003223615127617597
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,0.017203530443470904
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an “error signal” that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers are other cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circuit uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorders, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local “decisions” cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit’s function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative. The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders.

"Dopaminergic Epigenomes from Human Brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmentally regulated histone modification and DNA methylation changes, shaping gene expression patterns and genome organization, are likely to be of fundamental importance for orderly ontogenesis and cellular differentiation. Therefore, comprehensive and high resolution mapping of cell type-specific epigenomes from brain bear enormous merit both from the viewpoint of developmental biology and translational medicine alike. To date, however, comprehensive and genome-wide maps of epigenomes for defined cell populations from brain, and their developmental trajectories, do not exist. This important gap in epigenetic information can finally be addressed with a recently introduced protocol that efficiently separates-in brain tissue-chromatin from different cell types. In this proposal, we will explore, for the first time, the histone methylation landscapes of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the human brain. These cells play a key role in the neurobiology of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from drug addiction to neurodegenerative (e.g., Parkinson's) conditions. Focus will be on tri-methyl-histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark enriched at transcription start sites (H3K4me3) and a subset of CpG-rich sequences, and tri-methyl-H3K36me3, a mark associated with RNA polymerase II activity and transcriptional elongation across coding and non-coding regions. Beyond the goals of this R21 proposal, the long-term vision for the collaboration between our two groups at Wayne State and UMASS is to explore changes in the dopaminergic epigenome of subjects diagnosed with stimulant and other substance abuse.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For the majority of patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric diseases (including but not limited to drug addiction) no straightforward genetic cause has been identified. Many of the molecular pathways involved in substance abuse disorders involve genes expressed in a type of cell called the 'dopaminergic neuron'. These comprise only a small fraction of cells in a brain region called 'ventral midbrain'. These nerve cells exert a powerful effect on the brain's motivational and affective states. To further understand the role of the dopaminergic neurons in neuropsychiatric illness, and to clarify gene expression activities in normal and disease states, it will be critically important to explore their genomes and chromatin architectures at high resolution. This grant proposal is based on extremely innovative techniques that were recently developed in our laboratories. We will be able, for the first time, t selectively isolate chromosomal materials and chromatin from the dopamine neurons of the human brain for the study of ""epigenetic markings"" (basically, chemical modifications that regulate gene expression and function without altering the genetic code) on a genome-wide level. We expect that the work resulting from this project will provide a valuable resource /chromatin atlas for the neuroscience research community and will shed light on some of the mechanisms that govern gene expression activity in dopamine neurons of subjects exposed to drugs of abuse.              For the majority of patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric diseases (including but not limited to drug addiction) no straightforward genetic cause has been identified.

Beyond the goals of this R21 proposal, the long-term vision for the collaboration between our two groups at Wayne State and UMASS is to explore changes in the dopaminergic epigenome of subjects diagnosed with stimulant and other substance abuse.          For the majority of patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric diseases (including but not limited to drug addiction) no straightforward genetic cause has been identified. Many of the molecular pathways involved in substance abuse disorders involve genes expressed in a type of cell called the 'dopaminergic neuron'. These comprise only a small fraction of cells in a brain region called 'ventral midbrain'. These nerve cells exert a powerful effect on the brain's motivational and affective states. To further understand the role of the dopaminergic neurons in neuropsychiatric illness, and to clarify gene expression activities in normal and disease states, it will be critically important to explore their genomes and chromatin architectures at high resolution. This grant proposal is based on extremely innovative techniques that were recently developed in our laboratories. We will be able, for the first time, t selectively isolate chromosomal materials and chromatin from the dopamine neurons of the human brain for the study of ""epigenetic markings"" (basically, chemical modifications that regulate gene expression and function without altering the genetic code) on a genome-wide level. We expect that the work resulting from this project will provide a valuable resource /chromatin atlas for the neuroscience research community and will shed light on some of the mechanisms that govern gene expression activity in dopamine neurons of subjects exposed to drugs of abuse.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",9119539,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,811921,0.08010025580351472

Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",8935965,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Plastics', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,952773,0.08010025580351472

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.

"Supplement request to: Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function. Our procedures and analysis will mitigate many of the difficulties that have limited our ability to discern the structre and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Supplement request to: Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits,9085015,U01NS090595,"['Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Jaw', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neck', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nociception', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smell Perception', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Taste Perception', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tongue', 'Touch sensation', 'Trigeminal System', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'feeding', 'image processing', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuronal circuitry', 'orofacial', 'programs', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'vocalization']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2015,87000,0.14754061272434352

"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"The Molecular Basis of Intracortical Projection Neuron Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cerebral cortex is the seat of higher brain function, responsible for sensory perception, cognitive processes, voluntary movement, and consciousness. Abnormalities of the human cerebral cortex cause neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. A key feature of the functional anatomy of the human cerebral cortex is its organization into functionally distinct regions along its tangential dimension. During brain development, highly heterogeneous cell types must precisely assemble into unique neural circuits both within and between these areas to control complex behaviors and cognitive processes. The molecular mechanisms that encode cortical projection neuron subtype identity and synaptic specificity remain poorly understood. This proposal details a 3 year plan for postdoctoral research and professional development under the mentorship of Dr. Nenad Sestan, Professor of Neurobiology at Yale University. The fellow will investigate the mechanisms that form the molecular basis for intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity and projection identity. The fellow will build on his existing expertise in neurodevelopmental biology, microscopy, histology, and cell biology. He will further develop new expertise in  the structure and function of the developing cerebral cortex, neural circuit tracing, transcriptional profiling,  single-cell sorting, and advanced mouse genetic technologies by pursuing the following specific aims: 1.)  Characterization of intra-cortical projections in association areas of auditory cortex (A2), 2.) Transcriptional profiling and characterization of intra-cortical projection neuron subtypes in A2, and 3.) Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that establish intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity in A2.

This project explores the mechanisms that determine how connections between different functional regions of the cerebral cortex are made during development in order to determine how these connections might be abnormal in disease.                ",The Molecular Basis of Intracortical Projection Neuron Heterogeneity,8959587,F32NS090812,"['Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroporation', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'frontal lobe', 'genetic technology', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single cell sequencing', 'skills', 'speech processing', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,55106,0.08818858956031789
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells-Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                   The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction.

"Systematic functional dissection of neuronal transcriptome diversity Project summary Systematic functional dissection of neuronal transcriptome diversity Cell type-specific alternative splicing (AS) enormously amplifies the neuronal transcriptome diversity. Proper regulation of such molecular complexity and its establishment during development is critical for the maturation of nerve cells and maintenance of their homeostasis. Multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been identified to control neuron-specific splicing. We pioneered the development of an “RBP-centric” strategy to reconstruct precisely the splicing regulatory networks of specific classes of neuronal RBPs using an integrative analysis framework that combines multiple modalities of experimental and computational data. These efforts generated prioritized lists of developmentally regulated exons that will be studied in details to improve our understanding of the functional importance of AS at various stages of neuronal differentiation. However, a major roadblock for the field is our current inability to efficiently interrogate the function of a vast number of splice variants. To fill in this gap, we propose to develop an “exon-centric” strategy using an exon- specific genetic screen to dissect directly and systematically the functional role of specific splice variants during neural development. For a pilot study, our focus is to identify alternative exons that regulate axon morphogenesis in an in vitro model system of spinal motor neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. In Aim 1, we will establish a large-scale genome-editing platform to delete individual alternative exons in mES cells through lentivirus-based, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. We designed a cloning strategy that will allow us to build a CRISPR library with a large pool of paired guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting individual alternative exons to trigger specific exon deletion. Parameters for optimizing the complexity of the library, viral delivery, and efficiency of genome editing will be established. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot screen of ~100 prioritized neuronal alternative exons and identify those important for axon outgrowth. To perform this screening based on analysis of neuronal morphology in the absence of a reliable reporter, we propose a strategy to derive clonal mutant mES cell populations from transduced cell pools in a high-throughput format. These clonal lines carrying individual mutations will be subject to paralleled neuronal differentiation, high-throughput imaging and phenotypic analysis. This strategy will allow sensitive detection of mutants showing fine morphological defects in axon growth, which will be genotyped and further validated. Our approach will therefore combine advantages of being both scalable and flexible. This study will establish a very effective method to extend our knowledge of gene function to the level of individual splice variants. This strategy can be readily adapted to study the molecular programs underlying neural differentiation, migration, and function in normal and pathological contexts. Project Narrative Neuron-specific alternative splicing is tightly and dynamically controlled during brain development and its perturbation is implicated in progression of multiple neurological disorders such ALS, FTLD, epilepsy and autism. This study aims to developing a novel screening platform to establish connections between individual transcript variants generated by alternative splicing and the cellular functions they regulate. Such a platform could have transformative applications for the identification of disease modifiers and novel drug targets.",Systematic functional dissection of neuronal transcriptome diversity,9164138,R21NS098172,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Cloning', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epilepsy', 'Exons', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genome engineering', 'Genotype', 'Guide RNA', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA library', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Spinal', 'Staging', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'cell type', 'cellular transduction', 'design', 'driving force', 'embryonic stem cell', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'mammalian genome', 'migration', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'particle', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'screening', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'text searching', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,239005,-0.021566661247980116
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.052038498541855736
"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,0.09877359448078005
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,0.052841721528855294

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces.

"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically.

"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling “craving” states (operationally defined as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance – an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab’s other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments.

"Multi-regional neural circuit dynamics underlying short-term memory Abstract Short-term memory (STM) is a core cognitive function, critical for reasoning, decision-making, and flexible behavior. Though it has been recognized as a key function of interest for many decades, the critical neural substrate of STM is little understood. Recording experiments have found distributed persistent activity related to STM across multiple brain areas, yet it is unclear what the critical circuit nodes are, whether STM is supported by a single distributed circuit or involves many distinct parallel representations at the same time, and what if any are the causal relations between STM related activity in different brain areas. This gap in knowledge stems from lacks of a holistic view of the neural dynamics giving rise to STM. Comprehensive studies that examine multiple brain regions within a single STM behavior are severely lacking. Moreover, recordings alone cannot assess how signals across multiple brain regions are related to each other and to behavior. Transient perturbation is a powerful approach to probe recurrent neural networks. The response of neural dynamics following a transient perturbation are related to the network structure. The objective of this proposal is to use region-specific and temporally-precise perturbations in multiple brain regions to probe critical circuit nodes for STM. This will demonstrate the potential of our approach for identifying multi-regional circuits driving behavior and generate hypotheses regarding their network structure. We focus on a frontal cortical region (ALM) that is critical for a STM behavior we developed. Mice make a sensory discrimination, followed by a delay epoch in which they maintain a STM of their upcoming motor response. ALM neurons exhibit persistent activity that are causally related to the upcoming movement. STM neural dynamics are funneled through ALM projections to the brainstem to trigger a behavioral response. These properties make ALM an ideal entry point to read out the dynamics arising from the interactions of different circuit nodes and relate the dynamics to behavior. We will first obtain a comprehensive dataset where we transiently perturb all of the candidate brain regions for STM (identified using recordings and anatomy) while monitoring their consequences on STM dynamics in ALM with population recordings using the latest silicon probe technology (Aim1). We will then perform theoretical analysis of the perturbed dynamics leading to model classes that relate specific dynamics to behavior and serve as hypotheses for the underlying circuit structure (Aim2). If successful, this approach will identify the critical anatomical substrate and the relevant STM neural dynamics in a single behavior. The model outcome will subsequently guide a truly targeted yet comprehensive investigation of the multi-regional STM circuit. Project Narrative Short-term memory is a core cognitive function that enables reasoning, decision-making, mental experience, and is disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. This project aims to develop an integrative approach to record, map, and perturb brain circuits using advanced technologies in theory-motivated experiments that will produce multi-regional models of short-term memory circuits. An understanding of the neural circuits that support short-term memory could be a starting point for understanding the neural dynamics underlying brain function and dysfunction.",Multi-regional neural circuit dynamics underlying short-term memory,9568830,R21NS104781,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Explosion', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiregional Analyses', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'combinatorial', 'data modeling', 'driving behavior', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'stem', 'theories']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,197195,-0.018390781230713468
"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings.

"Ensemble neural dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex underlying cognitive flexibility and reinforcement learning Abstract The prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in cognitive flexibility, in part by updating a person's expectations about the external world and the likely consequences of candidate actions based on the feedback gained from past actions. Deficits in this form of cognition occur in multiple psychiatric conditions in which prefrontal cortex is implicated. Despite much research, the mechanisms by which prefrontal neural circuits contribute to flexible decision-making and switches in cognitive strategy remain unclear. We will examine these issues using reinforcement learning theory, which specifies the optimal strategies for selecting future actions given a subject's past history of actions taken and rewards received. We will first gather the largest set of multi- neuronal recordings ever taken in prefrontal cortex, and then use reinforcement learning theory to analyze the data and deduce the circuit mechanisms by which the prefrontal cortex stores and updates its internal beliefs about the external world and the likely results of future actions.  Past studies in behaving animals have found evidence for individual prefrontal cells that, on average, encode information related to cognitive strategy and action selection, but with limited data it has not been possible to identify how prefrontal circuits maintain and update this information over the course of multiple decisions, actions and outcomes. To collect sufficient data and create better models of prefrontal circuits, we will use a miniature microscope enabling us to monitor large neural ensembles in active mice. Our goals are to: (1) Develop and validate an experimental paradigm for imaging the concurrent dynamics of hundreds of prefrontal cells in mice flexibly switching between two different strategies of spatial navigation. Our pilot data show mice can perform the task well, that prefrontal activity is crucial for strategy-switching, and that prefrontal cortex contains cells whose dynamics appear to signal estimates of the optimal strategy. We will verify mice can follow bona fide navigation strategies and not just memorize spatial paths that yield reward. We will also confirm the prefrontal cells stay healthy and have normal activity patterns throughout the multi-day experiment. (2) Use reinforcement learning theory to analyze our large datasets and create neural circuit models of how prefrontal cortex stores and updates its beliefs to guide future actions. Using the theory we will first create observer-actor models of mouse behavior. We will then apply supervised and unsupervised methods of data analysis to assess whether prefrontal neural ensembles encode task-related, abstract variables such as belief and value. Using our observer-actor models and analyses of neural dynamics, we will train recurrent neural network models to solve the strategy-switching task. The resulting circuit models of reinforcement learning will then yield testable predictions about how the mice and prefrontal cells should behave when we modify the task.  Overall, our study will address key unanswered questions about prefrontal function and seeks to attain a mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal circuits contribute to flexible decision-making.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior.

"Circuit mechanisms underlying learned changes in persistent neural activity ABSTRACT Persistent neural activity, a sustained response following brief stimuli that is observed in many brain networks, needs to be appropriately tuned to meet the exacting demands of various motor and cognitive tasks. One task that has been particularly amenable to understanding persistent neural activity is the oculomotor control of gaze position. In the oculomotor system, where persistent activity maintains the appropriate gaze angle necessary for high-acuity vision, this tuning arises in large part through an interaction loop between the cerebellum and the oculomotor neural integrator, a brainstem structure that temporally integrates eye velocity commands to generate eye position encoding signals. Whereas we understand a fair bit about the coding properties and signal transformations within the cerebellum and especially the neural integrator proper, the interactions between these key brain centers is poorly understood. Here we aim to close this gap through an integrative approach using a combination of whole-network two-photon imaging, targeted optical perturbations, serial-section electron microscopy, in-vivo electrophysiology, and next-generation network modeling. In Aim 1, we will combine volumetric imaging of neuronal dynamics in the zebrafish with learning and targeted perturbations to examine the causal relationships between cerebellar and integrator populations. In Aim 2, we will perform high-resolution serial-section electron microscopy of a functionally imaged brain to gain insight into the global circuit's anatomical connectivity. In Aim 3, we will directly fit a network model to these dynamical and structural data to find the physiological interaction patterns in the circuit and predict the sites of plasticity. In Aim 4, we will probe predicted sites of plasticity using cell-targeted optical stimulations and whole-cell patch recordings. These tools and results will enable concrete predictions about the circuit mechanisms tuning persistent neural activity, guide understanding of the modular loops between the cerebellum and a wide range of other brain areas, and serve as a benchmark for efforts to understand the dynamics and plasticity of interactions across the brain. NARRATIVE The tuning of persistent neural activity, a sustained network response following brief stimulation, is important for a range of behaviors from sensorimotor integration to decision making. In this proposal we will combine whole-network imaging, optical perturbations, serial-section electron microscopy, next-generation network modeling, and whole-cell patch electrophysiology to determine the circuit mechanisms underlying the tuning of persistent activity.",Circuit mechanisms underlying learned changes in persistent neural activity,9840947,R01NS104926,"['Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemosensitization', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic Markers', 'Image', 'Information Storage', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'activity marker', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell type', 'cognitive task', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'eye velocity', 'gaze', 'hindbrain', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'network models', 'next generation', 'oculomotor', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality environment']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,804160,0.034443570224606056
"Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy Project Summary/Abstract: Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. While current management of epilepsy depends on continuous medication or invasive surgery, a deeper understanding of circuit-level pathology and an ability to predict seizures reliably will yield more focused therapeutic approaches. We will induce spontaneous unilateral focal seizures in rats by focal injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus. We will continuously record intracranial EEG, LFP, and video data from these rats for a period of 120 days. Relevant features will then be computed, including signal correlations, coherence, energy, entropies, and phase synchronization, as well as features detected by a sparse autoencoder. We will build train predictive classifiers using the first 90 days of data input to the following algorithms: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest, (3) support vector machines, and (4) neural networks. Performance will be assessed by ROC computed for the last 30 days of data. Next, we will apply single pulse electrical stimuli periodically to a new cohort of continuously monitored rats with unilateral hippocampal focal epilepsy. We will analyze the responses to this single pulse electrical stimulus on intracranial EEG and depth electrodes to determine whether seizures can be interrupted, predicted, then preempted by stimulus. Machine learning approaches coupled with active electrical stimulation will render algorithms that identify changes in the electrographic response to stimulus, which predict subsequent seizures with high sensitivity and specificity. We will leverage the fine spatiotemporal resolution offered by optogenetic techniques to study the nature of seizure initiation at the circuit level in a closed-loop system. We will probe the hippocampal circuit considered a generator in focal epilepsy: pyramidal neurons expressing CamK2a. To target each of these elements, we will induce expression of a halorhodopsin driven by the CamK2a promoter via a lentivirus delivered stereotactically to the hippocampal CA3. We will then stimulate the halorhodopsin with 589 nm light pulses, delivered during pre-ictal activity identified by the predictive algorithms and stimulus response. This closed-loop system will be uniquely informative by altering brain states preemptively rather than during the actual seizure as done in previous studies. Our study will ultimately offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, and may help improve diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Project Narrative: In a rat model of epilepsy, we will study the patterns of brain electrical activity in response to electrical stimulus, and how those patterns change in distinct brain states including: seizure, immediately before seizure, and between seizures. We will use statistical and computational approaches to predict seizures, and subsequently preempt the predicted seizures using stimulus that targets the seizure-generating circuit in the brain. The goal of this project is to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, with an eye to therapeutic applications of seizure prediction.",Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy,9600418,F31NS105161,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Focal Seizure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Kainic Acid', 'Label', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Rattus', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'brain electrical activity', 'cohort', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'preempt', 'promoter', 'response', 'spatiotemporal']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2018,37596,0.008442086644628305
"Principles of multi-whisker stimulus integration in rodent somatosensory cortex Project Summary Integration of sensory signals is crucial for sensory processing in the brain. Rodent whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) provides a powerful system to study this, because neurons integrate tactile information across a discrete array of whiskers. S1 circuitry is well characterized, but tactile representation remains poorly understood. Most studies have focused S1 encoding of single-whisker deflections. This stimuli elicit low-probability spiking, relatively weak somatotopic tuning, and highly similar receptive fields and maps in thalamus and across cortical layers. This weak- redundant code suggests that S1 neurons may code for more complex stimuli than single-whisker deflections. My project tests whether S1 neurons code for multi-whisker stimuli, which are generated during natural whisker sensation. I propose that multi-whisker tuning is achieved by linear and non-linear integration and that multi- whisker features are represented in a novel topographic map in S1. Aim 1 describes past work in which I extensively characterized multi-whisker tuning to 2-whisker sequences, which represent a tractable and important subset of multi-whisker stimuli. I discovered that many neurons have strong spatiotemporal tuning for specific 2- whisker sequences at specific inter-whisker-deflection-intervals (Δt). I found that a combination of linear and nonlinear mechanisms construct and enhance spatial selectivity, with prominent sublinear suppression of non-preferred stimuli. I also discovered principles governing Δt tuning and that it enhances spatial selectivity for 2-whisker sequences, thus defining general computations underlying multi-whisker integration In Aim2, I will use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging to determine the representation of 2-whisker sequences at the population level. While neurons in L2/3 of S1 are highly intermixed by single-whisker tuning (Sato et al. 2007, Clancy KB et al. 2015), I propose that discrete cortical columns will be apparent if receptive fields are defined in terms of 2-whisker sequences. My results suggest that the edges of each column will be defined by a ring of spatiotemporally selective neurons that form discrete borders between columns through sharp differences in Δt tuning. Also, by imaging many neurons simultaneously, I will test whether firing correlations between spatiotemporally selective and non-selective units provide a robust population level code for 2-whisker sequences. This will greatly strengthen our understanding of how S1 represents multi-whisker stimuli. In Aim 3, I plan to extend my study of active sensory systems by studying the role of motor circuits in perception during active sensation. Overall, my research plan will contribute significantly to understanding how the brain integrates sensory and motor signals to generate accurate percepts of the world. Project Narrative The everyday lives of people with sensory disabilities, like blindness, are constantly challenged by their inability to fully perceive the world. This work identifies general mechanisms that the brain uses to represent the world by determining how it integrates sensory information from receptors like the fingertips.

"Principles of multi-whisker stimulus integration in rodent somatosensory cortex Project Summary Integration of sensory signals is crucial for sensory processing in the brain. Rodent whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) provides a powerful system to study this, because neurons integrate tactile information across a discrete array of whiskers. S1 circuitry is well characterized, but tactile representation remains poorly understood. Most studies have focused S1 encoding of single-whisker deflections. This stimuli elicit low-probability spiking, relatively weak somatotopic tuning, and highly similar receptive fields and maps in thalamus and across cortical layers. This weak- redundant code suggests that S1 neurons may code for more complex stimuli than single-whisker deflections. My project tests whether S1 neurons code for multi-whisker stimuli, which are generated during natural whisker sensation. I propose that multi-whisker tuning is achieved by linear and non-linear integration and that multi- whisker features are represented in a novel topographic map in S1. Aim 1 describes past work in which I extensively characterized multi-whisker tuning to 2-whisker sequences, which represent a tractable and important subset of multi-whisker stimuli. I discovered that many neurons have strong spatiotemporal tuning for specific 2- whisker sequences at specific inter-whisker-deflection-intervals (Δt). I found that a combination of linear and nonlinear mechanisms construct and enhance spatial selectivity, with prominent sublinear suppression of non-preferred stimuli. I also discovered principles governing Δt tuning and that it enhances spatial selectivity for 2-whisker sequences, thus defining general computations underlying multi-whisker integration In Aim2, I will use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging to determine the representation of 2-whisker sequences at the population level. While neurons in L2/3 of S1 are highly intermixed by single-whisker tuning (Sato et al. 2007, Clancy KB et al. 2015), I propose that discrete cortical columns will be apparent if receptive fields are defined in terms of 2-whisker sequences. My results suggest that the edges of each column will be defined by a ring of spatiotemporally selective neurons that form discrete borders between columns through sharp differences in Δt tuning. Also, by imaging many neurons simultaneously, I will test whether firing correlations between spatiotemporally selective and non-selective units provide a robust population level code for 2-whisker sequences. This will greatly strengthen our understanding of how S1 represents multi-whisker stimuli. In Aim 3, I plan to extend my study of active sensory systems by studying the role of motor circuits in perception during active sensation. Overall, my research plan will contribute significantly to understanding how the brain integrates sensory and motor signals to generate accurate percepts of the world.

"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits.

"Contribution of Peripheral Mechanoreceptor Subtypes to the Functional Organization of Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex The ability of our nervous system to represent the sensory environment requires a hierarchy of processing from the peripheral sensory receptors to sensory association areas in the cortex. While the overall structure of this hierarchy of the somatosensory system has been well-described, how information is represented at each level is not as well understood. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to reveal how information from the peripheral somatosensory system is integrated into the representation at the primary somatosensory cortex. We will use two-photon calcium imaging and in vivo electrophysiology with carefully applied mechanical stimulation to elucidate the spatial organization of mouse somatosensory cortical neurons with defined tuning properties. In particular, we will focus on how information is represented with single-cell resolution within cortical layers and how information is represented and transformed at different levels of the cortical hierarchy. Selective activation and silencing of peripheral mechanoreceptors will be used to determine the sufficiency and necessity of subtypes of mechanoreceptors for the production of tuning properties within neurons of primary somatosensory cortex. These experiments will enhance our conceptual understanding of information processing in sensory cortices, potentially leading to enhanced design of brain-machine interfaces. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of information processing in primary somatosensory cortex.

We propose to investigate the primary visual cortex because it is the cortical sensory area where the function of neurons has been described in greatest detail. We will perform calcium imaging of the primary visual cortex of mice to determine the tuning of visual cortical neurons in response to visual stimuli. We will tag the imaged neurons with photoactivatable GFP. We will harvest the RNA from the labeled neurons. We will perform next generation RNAseq to reveal the transcriptional profile of each individual neuron imaged in vivo. We will correlate the transcriptional profile of a neuron with its specific response to visual stimuli. Finally, we will se clustering algorithms and principal component analysis to classify neurons in different types based on those genes that best correlate with function. The result will be a genetically based classification method that provides functional information about cell types.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The classification of neurons into distinct types is a fundamental endeavor in neuroscience. Neuronal classification allows one to gain insight into the building blocks of the nervous system, is essential for a mechanistic understanding of the function of the nervous system and is a prerequisite for unambiguous communication between investigators. The goal of this proposal is to classify cortical neurons based on those genes that best predict neuronal function and location.                ",Classifying Cortical Neurons by Correlating Transcriptome with Function,8822747,U01MH105959,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Slice', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Visual Cortex', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'next generation', 'patch clamp', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2014,256785,0.09604918305988396

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation.

Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9584824,U19NS107466,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2018,2979311,0.014298400592419915
"Studying perceptual decision-making across cortex by combining population imaging, connectomics, and computational modeling Project Summary During perceptual decision-making, populations of neurons, arranged in highly interconnected microcircuits, work together to encode sensory stimuli and to transform sensory perception into appropriate behavioral choices. A fundamental gap in our knowledge about perceptual decision-making is understanding how the connectivity in cortical microcircuits shapes dynamics and information codes in populations of neurons. This gap has arisen because anatomical connectivity and activity have generally been studied separately, and because a computational framework to understand structure-function relationships in cortical microcircuits is missing. Here, we will assemble a team of researchers with complementary skills to tackle this problem. We will combine approaches to study population coding and dynamics using two-photon calcium imaging during a novel and complex decision task for mice, with measurements of connectivity in the imaged neurons using electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomics. Furthermore, we will use our activity and connectivity data to develop a data-driven model to explore structure-function relationships across cortical microcircuits. We will apply our new approach to investigate how population codes, microcircuit connectivity, and structure- function relationships differ across cortex to perform distinct computational tasks during perceptual decision- making. Although it is well established that sensory and association cortices perform different functions, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these different roles, including distinctions in microcircuit connectivity and population coding schemes. In a first aim, we will compare population codes and microcircuit connectivity for sensory stimuli and behavioral choices in visual cortex (V1; sensory cortex) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC; association cortex). We will use computational tools to examine how distinct coding schemes provide functional benefits. We will use EM connectomics in V1 and PPC for neurons imaged during a perceptual decision task to probe structure-function relationships for stimulus and choice codes. We will develop a data- driven recurrent neural network model to relate connectivity and population activity. In a second aim, we will investigate how neuronal populations transform sensory information into behavioral choices using microcircuit connectivity. We will develop a new statistical concept – intersection information – to identify activity patterns in V1 and PPC that carry sensory information that informs behavioral choices. Using EM connectomics, we will reconstruct the microcircuit connectivity between cells to test hypotheses about sensory-to-choice information flow. Our work will be some of the first to compare population coding and microcircuit connectivity across cortical regions and to explore structure-function relationships for perceptual decision-making.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data.

"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9654850,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2019,455655,0.033592313616297415

"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex.

"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease. This conference will strengthen communication between scientists working on dendrites and enhance the already rapid pace of discovery in this field.","2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar",9682708,R13NS110205,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biochemical', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Creativeness', 'Dendrites', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gated Ion Channel', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Income', 'Information Storage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retreatment', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'interest', 'meetings', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'planetary Atmosphere', 'racial minority', 'symposium', 'translational scientist', 'unpublished works', 'voltage']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,20000,0.03412396420432468
"Molecular, anatomic, and functional characterization of midbrain dopamine neuron subtypes The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), produced by midbrain DA neurons, influences a spectrum of behaviors including motor, reward, motivation, and cognition. In accordance with these functions, DA dysfunction is prominently implicated in a wide gamut of disorders affecting tens of millions of people, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, addiction and depression. Understanding how DA neurons control all of these distinct behaviors is important for understanding and treating these neuropsychiatric diseases.  The literature is dominated by anatomical classification of DA neurons based on location within the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) or Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). Guided by an emerging literature on DA neuron heterogeneity, we hypothesize that there must exist several molecularly and functionally distinct DA types, perhaps intermingled, that could underpin the myriad functions of DA. As a first step in classifying DA neurons, the Awatramani lab developed an approach to profile single midbrain DA neurons, each for the expression of 96 key genes, using a microfluidic dynamic RT-qPCR array. Hierarchical clustering indicated that DA neurons exhibited roughly six distinct molecular barcodes, presumably indicative of at least six molecularly and functionally distinct DA subtypes.  The Dombeck laboratory has developed a robust data set demonstrating functional heterogeneity of DA neurons in behaving mice. Previous models postulated that slow variations in tonic firing rates bias the system toward or away from movement, whereas phasic signaling was linked to unpredicted rewards. Using imaging in behaving mice, we showed heterogeneous expression of phasic locomotion and reward signaling in DA axons projecting to the striatum. In the dorsal striatum we found that most DA fibers displayed a phasic signal locked to the animal's cyclic accelerations during locomotion. In the ventral striatum, axonal signaling to unpredicted rewards was more prevalent. These results indicate that striatum DA release is not simply homogenous and movement permissive, but is richly heterogeneous with respect to reward and locomotion signaling.  Based on these complementary data sets- molecular heterogeneity and functional heterogeneity, our goal is to correlate molecular identity with anatomy and function. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the diversity, transcriptomes, and projections of DA neuron subtypes, developing intersectional genetic tools to access DA neuron subtypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish the behavioral signaling properties of the genetically identified DA subtypes that project to the striatum. Thus, using a collaborative approach between two laboratories each with distinct expertise, we aim to characterize DA neuron subtypes based on their molecular, anatomic and functional properties. These studies will be vital for designing targeted therapies for the DA system. Moreover these studies will provide genetic platforms for manipulations of DA subtypes towards understanding their role in mammalian behavior.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons.

Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both.

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease.

"Dendritic Computation and Representation of Head Direction in Retrosplenial Cortex The mammalian cortex plays a critical role in integrating multiple streams of information to guide adaptive behavior. For example, head direction (HD) information is combined with visual and spatial input in the mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Accurate integration of these signals is a necessary component of navigation: recognizing a distant landmark while facing north vs. facing south has very different interpretations for one's position and future actions. However, the mechanisms by which any cortical association area integrates different inputs at the level of individual neurons during behavior is unknown. RSC is therefore a compelling model system in which to test general associative computations during a complex behavior: the combination of visual and HD information during navigation.  Anatomical evidence suggests that HD inputs computed in the anterior thalamus make their synapses at distal apical dendrites in RSC, while visual and motor synapses are located closer to the somas of RSC principal neurons. This arrangement suggests that nonlinear dendritic integration may be used by RSC to combine HD with other inputs. Active dendritic integration is theorized to allow single neurons to respond flexibly to different combinations of input, where the state of one input nonlinearly influences the impact of another input. Our overarching hypothesis is that such mechanisms could work in concert with neural circuit computations to implement context-dependent cortical computations. Congruent with this idea, RSC neurons in navigating rats exhibit complex conjunctive receptive fields, a feature that is lacking from commonly studied primary sensory cortices. RSC is therefore an ideal area to evaluate the role of dendrites in associative computations during navigation. However, current methods are not well-suited to this level of investigation: they either allow mice to behave freely or they achieve sub-cellular resolution. This has led to a critical gap in our understanding of navigation, and by extension, associative cortex function. We have recently developed technology that bridges this gap: an animal-actuated rotating headpost that allows mice to engage in 2-D navigation by freely turning their head during conventional 2-photon imaging. We will use this new approach to test the hypothesis that neurons in RSC use sub-cellular processing to flexibly combine HD and visual information during navigation behavior. These experiments will provide new insights into cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms of navigation, and of associative cortical function in general. Results from this project will be valuable for understanding brain disease states as well as for building biologically-inspired artificial neural networks. The brain is a network of staggering complexing, yet each of its elementary units, single neurons, can themselves be seen as a network of sub-modules, performing complex functions such as learning to flexibly integrate multiple inputs. These within-cell computations may play an important role across in a variety of disease states including schizophrenia, ADHD, and Alzheimer’s disease, though, their role in neural circuit function remains poorly understood.

"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data Set', 'Developmental Process', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fasting', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Functional disorder', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Adaptation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'brain behavior', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'conditioning', 'feeding', 'fly', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'neurochemistry', 'neuronal excitability', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sugar']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,0.060899995176630015
"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy.

Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9373513,R21MH114166,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Communication', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'behavioral study', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'men', 'neural model', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'physical property', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'sex', 'social', 'social skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2017,253863,-0.07633645196752763

"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly.

"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory- experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way, I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,9871193,K99NS114194,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'limb movement', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'motor behavior', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'supervised learning', 'theories']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,124157,0.036400028212507936
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders.

"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies.

"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies.

"hPSC-derived microglia for in vitro modeling of Rett Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) retain the ability to generate any cell type in the human body, offering unprecedented access to a wide-array of human cell types. hPSCs are therefore a powerful model to study human neurodevelopmental diseases in vitro.57,59 Rett Syndrome (RTT), a devastating Autism-Spectrum- Disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 female births and causes severe regression by 18 months of age, is one such neurodevelopmental disorder.1,2 Hallmarks of RTT include an imbalance in inhibitory:excitatory synapses as well as excessive microglial pruning, but how these two pathologies are interconnected has yet to be fully explored. In this study, my goal is to decipher how inhibitory:excitatory synaptic imbalance in RTT is related to microglial-neuronal interplay using an iPSC-derived multi-cell type in vitro model containing both neurons and microglia. While there are established protocols for deriving neurons from hPSCs, to date there have been no developmentally-based differentiation schema for generating hPSC-derived microglia. Preliminary data shows that I can generate yolk sac primitive hematopoiesis in vitro to isolate microglial progenitors, and I have developed two different paradigms to generate microglial-like cells after co-culture with neurons. In this study, I aim to 1) compare the two paradigms to determine which generates microglial-like cells most similar to human primary microglia, and 2) use these cells to study the contribution of microglial-neuronal interaction in an iPSC-model of RTT. Specifically, I will investigate whether the inhibitory:excitatory synaptic imbalance in RTT is caused by a neuron-only phenotype or whether it is affected by microglial pruning.

"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors.

"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,0.11657590352211884

"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,-0.007971685115982565
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes.

"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,9946842,R01NS116350,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Lateral Sclerosis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'functional disability', 'graph theory', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuron loss', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'precision medicine', 'protein TDP-43', 'regional difference', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'symptomatology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R01,2020,606794,0.013619455585253699
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms. We will use this experimental framework to shed light into the sensory motor transformation underlying parenting behavior as a function of the animal sex and physiological state.",Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior,9971196,R01NS116593,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Child Rearing', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instinct', 'Investigation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'male', 'microendoscopy', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'predictive modeling', 'pup', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2444289,0.1184287708421382
"Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain. Project Summary The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL, called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals. This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes. Narrative Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, anhedonia, apathy, schizophrenia, addiction, eating disorders and Parkinson’s disease. In particular, aberrant dopamine responses to salient events have been implicated in addiction, schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Understanding dopamine signaling in the healthy brain is essential to understanding states of aberrant dopamine signaling.",Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain.,9978224,R01NS116753,"['Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Eating Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rewards', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'artificial neural network', 'classical conditioning', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning algorithm', 'network architecture', 'neuromechanism', 'optimism', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1162348,-0.014642854614399693
"The Progressive Elevation of Spontaneous Cortical Activity in HAND (PESCAH) Project Project Summary/Abstract Although HIV-infected patients in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population, they are at a significantly elevated risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Such disorders are the most common neurological complication of HIV disease, with prevalence estimates ranging from 35-70% of all HIV-infected patients, and research targeting such comorbidities has been identified as a top priority by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137). While the mechanisms that underlie HAND are not well understood, numerous human neuroimaging studies have examined the brain regions that may be involved, and overall these studies have been largely successful in identifying the critical hubs and large-scale networks. However, many questions remain regarding basic circuit dysfunction within these brain regions, and consequently there is a clear and common need to further investigate the key physiological parameters that may underlie the development and progression of HAND, especially in the context of aging. It is well known that human cortical neurons exhibit spontaneous firing in the absence of incoming exogenous and endogenous input. Across a neuronal population, these discharges summate with local dendritic currents and synaptic potentials to produce cortical rhythmic activity, which is often referred to as “spontaneous activity.” Such spontaneous rhythms are ubiquitous throughout the human brain, but their role in modulating cognition is only beginning to be understood. Recently, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to show that the strength of spontaneous activity directly affects neural oscillatory activity in the same cortical area, and in-turn modulates real time task performance in controls and HIV-infected adults. Additionally, we have shown that spontaneous activity in multiple brain regions increases with advancing age, that this increase is deleterious to performance, and that these effects are accentuated in patients with HAND. In fact, our preliminary data suggests that the level of spontaneous activity in specific brain regions may distinguish age-matched HIV-infected patients with and without HAND. In this project, we will quantify the trajectory of age-related elevations in spontaneous cortical activity in a large group of HIV-infected adults and demographically-matched controls. We will then evaluate how the strength of such spontaneous activity affects local neural oscillations and real time cognitive performance. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that spontaneous activity will increase with age in both groups, and that the slope of this increase will be steeper in HIV-infected adults relative to controls, and further accentuated in those with HAND. Importantly, we also hypothesize that these increases will be associated with proportional changes in the strength of the neural oscillations underlying cognition, and behavioral performance indices such as accuracy and reaction time. Finally, in Aim 3, we will utilize deep learning methods to classify our sample into groups based on the neurophysiological metrics derived from MEG, with the gold standard being their overall neuropsychological profile. Project Narrative HIV-infection has become a chronic manageable condition with a life expectancy that approaches that of the general population, but affected patients remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive disorders. Previous neuroimaging studies have mapped the brain regions that may be involved in these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders(HAND), and while these studies have been largely successful, many questions persist about the inherent physiology in these regions, and how it might differ in patients with HAND.

"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,-0.028898910158600338
"Prefrontal Anatomic Pathways in Executive Control ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prefrontal cortex in primates receives signals from structures associated with sensory perception, cognition, emotion and action, and uses them flexibly for the task at hand or to ponder the past and plan the future. These functions are guided by attention that engages prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and are disrupted in several neural diseases by unknown circuit mechanisms. The subgenual cingulate area 25 is a key node within the anterior cingulate, and has cellular and physiologic features consistent with its high activity at rest, a role in plastic processes, and complementary functions with dorsolateral task-related prefrontal areas. The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the largely unexplored circuitry of area 25 in a normal primate animal model. The working hypothesis is that specific cellular features of area 25 and interactions with excitatory and distinct types of inhibitory neurons in other prefrontal, temporal and thalamic structures underlie the plasticity of area 25 and engagement in networks for flexible behavior. Experiments are designed to test this hypothesis at high resolution in normal rhesus monkeys through study of: (1) glial and axon features in area 25 associated with excitability, synaptic function and axon remodeling; and the connections of area 25 with other cortices; (2) serial pathways through which dorsolateral prefrontal cortices may modulate activity in area 25 through the anterior cingulate area 32, by innervating excitatory and functionally distinct classes of inhibitory neurons; (3) key circuits that link the hippocampus with area 25, and link both structures with the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus, in a network associated with attention and the contextual significance of stimuli; (4) computational modeling to investigate how processing through area 25 and its local prefrontal and extended networks affects attention and appreciation of context. Hypotheses about pathway interactions are based on a theoretical framework that helps predict patterns of connections based on laminar structure. Multiple neural pathways will be labeled with neural tracers, combined with double- or triple-labeling of distinct classes of inhibitory neurons and receptors. Brain tissue will be processed for study at the light, confocal, and electron microscopic level to conduct quantitative analyses from the system of pathways to their synapses. Findings from these studies will provide the foundation to unravel in future studies the mechanisms underlying the preferential vulnerability of area 25 in neurologic and psychiatric diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia and major depression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A region in the front part of the brain known as cingulate area 25 has flexible function that makes it possible for people to appreciate the context of events, and is active when one quietly thinks about the past or plans the future. Area 25 is disrupted in the neurological disease frontotemporal dementia, as well as in depression and autism, leading to loss of appreciation of the context of events affecting behavior and social interactions, but th causes are not understood. This project involves mapping the circuits of this region in a primate animal model, as well as specific cellular features that give A25 flexibility but may also render i vulnerable to disease, which is needed for development of therapies.",Prefrontal Anatomic Pathways in Executive Control,9659232,R01MH117785,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Availability', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Myelin', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tracer', 'artificial neural network', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'design', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'therapy development', 'translational study']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,605202,0.0633475712334197
"Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to develop a widely adoptable, high-throughput, functional connectomics platform to semi-automatically reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of functionally characterized neuronal microcircuits. We will develop this pipeline in the context of understanding neural microcircuits that control walking, using the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) as a model system. The VNC constitutes over a third of the fly central nervous system, and functions like the spinal cord to control movement and sensation of the limbs. It has a tractable number of neurons (~60,000), many of which are genetically identified and anatomically stereotyped, making it an excellent brain region for developing a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits. Our approach will integrate several technologies from our labs, including in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in walking flies, high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (EM), automated, deep- learning based connectomic reconstruction, and cell morphology-based analytics. Using this pipeline we will generate the first dense functional connectomes of the VNC, including the sensorimotor leg circuitry from multiple male and female flies. We will use these data to test the hypothesis that there exist specific patterns of synaptic connectivity between functional subtypes of leg proprioceptors and motor neurons. By creating the first connectomes of a microcircuit that orchestrates walking behavior, we anticipate this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the circuit basis of sensorimotor transformation and motor control. It will also create an important resource for the Drosophila and neuroscience communities, through publicly available tools and datasets that integrate connectivity, morphology, and cellular physiology data. Moreover, the technical approaches we develop for high-throughput functional connectomics can be readily applied to other brain regions and across species. Project Narrative Detailed mapping of neural computations and the neuronal circuits that underlie them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding central nervous system function in health and disease. Our goal is to develop an accessible, high-throughput pipeline of tools that we will use to dissect the relationship between neuronal connectivity and function in circuits that control walking. We will focus on sensorimotor transformations in the tractable genetic model organism Drosophila to dissect fundamental principles of proprioceptive feedback in motor control, while improving the speed and accessibility of functional connectomics for the broader scientific community.",Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics,9822460,RF1MH117808,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrical Synapse', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Proprioceptor', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Walking', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'light microscopy', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor neuron function', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'two-photon']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2019,4347595,0.08332172179216546
"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 µm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume. However, significant technical challenges remain to improve EM acquisition and analysis methods to the point of achieving the millimeter-scale volumes required to reconstruct neuronal assemblies underlying complex behaviors. Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasets—essentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out ‘virtual experiments.’ Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior. Neural recordings in singing birds of every known cell type in cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia circuits, have led to mechanistic circuit-level hypotheses, which in turn make clear and testable predictions about the ultrastructure of neural circuits. The proposed tools would allow neuroscientists to bridge the gap from vEM data to the virtuous circle of hypothesis driven anatomical experimentation, and data-inspired hypotheses. Our proposal describes three Specific Aims directed toward these goals: · Aim 1: Develop tools to acq uire and to automatically segment millimeter-scale EM data sets · Aim 2: Develop tools to densely identify cell-types of segmented neurites using ultrastructural fingerprints · Aim 3: Develop and test a platform for virtual experimentation in segmented and annotated EM datasets PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this BRAIN Initiative project is to develop tools and resources that will facilitate the detailed analysis of brain microconnectivity. We will develop new approaches and optimize existing techniques to facilitate this important new approach to understanding the basic circuitry and computations underlying brain function. The connectomic tools we develop will be of interest to, and will be made accessible to, the broader scientific community; such tools, and the detailed annotated structural datasets they enable, will facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms of brain disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and Huntington’s disease.",From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap,9609873,RF1MH117809,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Distant', 'Dorsal', 'Dreams', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Equipment', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'LOC118430 gene', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Songbirds', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2018,1845026,0.12360385506087375
"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.) Project Narrative We propose to build a next generation platform for crowdsourcing the fly connectome to a community of neuroscientists. The fly connectome will accelerate progress in circuit neuroscience. The methods developed by the project will be relevant for future discovery of connectopathies.",Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome,9610061,RF1MH117815,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Authorship', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Names', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Vertebral column', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'community organizations', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'interest', 'male', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'retinal neuron', 'sex', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2018,1703741,0.14582367201660662
"Network and dendritic mechanisms of context-dependent cortical computation Many disorders including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease are being studied in-depth on the cellular and molecular level, and considerable progress has been made on how they change synaptic transmission and single neuron function. However, how cellular-level neuronal function translates to disruptions in larger-scale network function and cognition is not well understood. A key link between cellular function and behavior is the integration of synaptic inputs in the dendrites of neurons, which can give each individual neuron its own computational mechanisms that in turn shape the computations performed by networks of neurons. Efforts to study how sub-cellular dendritic function contributes to brain function and behavior, especially via the associative cortices involved in higher-level cognition, have been challenging, due to two major barriers. First, in rodents, the behaviors that engage associative cortices are incompatible with head fixation, limiting our ability to measure dendritic signals during complex behavior. Second, interpreting data from natural behaviors is computationally and conceptually hard: sensory encoding can be understood by averaging hundreds of trial repetitions, but studying decision-making in this manner makes animals memorize simple and stable stimulus-response associations, which do not require associative cortices in the same manner. This proposal will use new approaches that overcome these issues to examine the contributions of dendritic and network computation in a complex associative behavior. This project exploits a novel approach for cellular-level imaging in free behavior, and a task that requires animals to perform associative computations but is easy to train. The candidate has expertise in systems neuroscience, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and engineering, providing a strong foundation for this program. The K99 will provide training in dendritic physiology, and the computational methods required for linking complex tasks to the activity of individual neurons and networks of neurons despite variability in behavior. The primary mentor Dr. Mark Harnett will provide mentorship in dendritic function and methods for studying subcellular computation. The co- mentor Dr. Ila Fiete will provide training in computational methods relevant to the task. Additional advice from Dr. Mehrdad Jazayeri on modeling population dynamics and Dr. Cengiz Pehlevan on the mathematical properties of the underlying computations will ensure high-level training in all relevant scientific approaches. This training will enable the candidate to complete these aims and to develop an independent research program focused on neural computations underlying complex natural behaviors. The results of this research will provide new insight into how cellular computations contribute to complex behaviors, which will be important for understanding disorders with non-trivial behavioral phenotypes that are not easily studied in classical rodent behavior, such as dementia and schizophrenia. The brain is commonly thought of as a network of neurons, and each neuron is in-itself a network that performs complex functions such as learning to combine multiple inputs. These within-cell computations may play an important role in a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, dementia, autism, and epilepsy, but their role in complex and natural behaviors remains poorly understood. This project will apply new tools and computational approaches to understand how neurons coordinate during complex behaviors and establish the role of dendritic computations in these computations, providing novel insight into general mechanisms of associative cortical function.",Network and dendritic mechanisms of context-dependent cortical computation,10041188,K99NS118112,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Apical', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell behavior', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'expectation', 'free behavior', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual motor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,103324,0.10394275739533221
"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. To do this we will apply cutting-edge approaches for measuring activity in neuronal populations, mapping circuitry at high-resolution, and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system—the weakly electric mormryid fish. The research will produce a detailed computational model, spanning from biophysical to network levels, of how learning arises from synaptic plasticity that is widely distributed across processing layers and cell types.",Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit,10053457,R01NS118448,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mormyridae', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'skills']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1521512,0.07903135052831833
"Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology ABSTRACT Detailed characterizations of brain development are essential to understanding factors underlying the emergence of psychopathology and its progression. Corticostriatal thalamocortical (CSTC) circuits are central to current models of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies. However, our understanding of their development and the impact of pathologic processes on these circuits is primarily limited to regional structural properties and specific disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive examination of CSTC circuit development and its relations to psychopathology. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to characterize the development of CSTC circuits using structural MRI and resting state functional MRI, and to link variations in their trajectories to the emergence of psychopathology. We will model developmental trajectories of structural morphology and functional interactions within seven CSTC networks defined based on their connectivity with large-scale cortical networks and relate deviations to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Consistent with recent calls for secondary analysis of existing datasets to accelerate the identification of brain-behavior relationships that may serve as modifiable clinical targets, the proposed work will make use of openly shared pediatric imaging datasets (ages: 5.0-24.0; high resolution T1 anatomical and resting state functional scans for each participant). Specifically, we will generate a large-scale aggregate cross-sectional sample (n = 3918) for the purposes of delineating trajectories for the seven CSTC networks. We train age-prediction models for each of the networks and pool their predictions to generate multivariate CSTC maturity profiles for each individual. These profiles will be used to subtype individuals into neurobiologically homogenous subgroups, which are expected to differ with respect to dimensional measures of psychopathology calculated using the bifactor model framework (i.e. general psychopathology [p-factor], internalizing, externalizing). An aggregate longitudinal sample (n = 250; 3 time- points per participant, each 12-15 months apart) will be generated to evaluate the ability of changes in CSTC maturity profiles over time to predict longitudinal changes in psychopathology. Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Estimate the developmental trajectories of seven CSTC networks; 2) Determine associations between CSTC network maturity profile subtypes and dimensions of psychopathology; and 3) Evaluate predictive relationships between longitudinal changes in maturity profiles and those in dimensions of psychopathology. Given the scale of the datasets employed, cloud-based computing, and optimized analytic frameworks will be leveraged to ensure the feasibility of achieving the proposed work within the project period. All codes developed will be openly shared.

"Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets Project Summary/Abstract Our project will create a computational resource, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to support the neuroscience community’s efforts to build a reproducible, comprehensive, data-driven atlas of brain cell types. Laboratories in the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network and others are generating large-scale molecular datasets from multiple regions of the mouse and human brain using single cell sequencing technology. These datasets include single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes (RNA-Seq), as well as single nucleus DNA methylomes (mC-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq). Each data type provides complementary information about the molecular identity of brain cells: transcriptomes directly measure gene expression, while epigenomic data indicates both gene expression levels and the activity of intergenic regulatory regions such as enhancers. However, there is no computational resource for integrating these data from these multiple modalities and for statistically validating the reliability and reproducibility of the cell types defined based on each dataset. The Single Neuron Analyzer will work within the framework of the Single Cell Portal, which provides horizontally-scalable, highly performant solutions that allow researchers to efficiently scale with the growing size of datasets as the technology for single cell sequencing advances. In Aim 1, we will use machine learning and cross-validation to study the reproducibility of cell types defined by researchers based on one or more datasets. The Single Neuron Analyzer will allow users to compute a quantitative score, corresponding to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), which quantifies the degree to which cell type labels can be predicted based on independent data such as experimental replicates or complementary molecular assays. Aim 2 will build a data integration system that can jointly analyze single cells profiled by different technologies and modalities, including transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We will take advantage of the reliable correlation of gene expression with low gene body DNA methylation and high chromatin accessibility, to link cells measured in one modality with their closest matching neighbors in the other two modalities. The resulting neighbor graphs will be used to impute the missing data, followed by joint cluster analysis and low-dimensional projection of the integrated dataset. Following joint analysis, the system will provide a variety of visualizations and downloadable reports about key markers for each cell type. By combining transcriptomic and epigenomic information, the system will predict cell type specific genes as well as putative enhancers. Single Neuron Analyzer will offer researchers across the neuroscience community a resource for rigorous multi-modal molecular analysis of neuronal cell types, helping to advance the goal of comprehensively understanding the brain’s cellular parts list. Project Narrative Neuroscientists are currently creating large databases of information about the molecular characteristics of brain cell types, such as their patterns of gene expression and epigenetic regulation, in order to better understand the cellular components that make up brain circuits. Our project will create a computational tool, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to integrate different datasets and validate their conclusions. The result will be a system that can reliable and reproducible characterizations of the brain’s cell types and their molecular and genetic regulation.","Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets",9795063,RF1MH120015,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Enhancers', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Privatization', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human reference genome', 'methylome', 'molecular scale', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web-accessible']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,1227489,0.030930085234555493
"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease.

"Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit Project Summary/Abstract We have recently published a 3D electron microscopy volume of the whole fruit fly brain. However mapping of synaptic `wiring diagrams' or connectomes of neuronal circuits from this volume is currently completely manual and therefore slow. Our long-term goal is to increase understanding of how circuits process and transform information, both by accelerating connectomics mapping, and increasing the power and accessibility of analysis tools. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) provide newly available whole-brain segmentations to the user community, by extending the widely used, web-based circuit-mapping and analysis platform, CATMAID; and (ii) develop, validate, and apply new analysis tools for delivering insight into circuit structure. These objectives will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Deploy automatic segmentations to a CATMAID server where members of the fly neurobiology community can create and manage their own collaborative projects; 2) Provide integrated, scalable, and cross-modal software for analysis of connectomes and neurogeometry; and 3) Complete proof-of-principle projects using this infrastructure, including the first whole-brain tractography database, a study of stereotypy in position, number and connectivity of tracts and identified cell types, and a complete map of microconnectivity in the calyx of the mushroom body. In Aim 1, two recently generated whole-brain segmentations of all neurites and all synaptic clefts will be skeletonized, imported into CATMAID, and provided for use by the fly neurobiologists (>20 labs immediately; the entire community shortly thereafter). In Aim 2, tools for shape-based neuron search will be integrated into CATMAID, allowing online databases of cell type morphology to assist the reconstruction workflow and find genetic driver lines for behavior and physiology experiments at the bench. Analysis software will be written for automated tractography, location of contralateral circuit element equivalents, and identification of synaptic partners. In Aim 3, this infrastructure will be used in proof-of-principle analyses designed to test and guide infrastructure development, while providing important biological contributions in their own right. The proposed research is innovative because it will: almost immediately provide segmentation-assisted circuit reconstruction to the fly community in the whole fly brain dataset; provide powerful new analysis tools; and enable individual labs to form and manage their own public or private collaborations in an expertly managed server environment. The proposed research is significant because acceleration of circuit mapping will greatly increase our understanding of information processing in the brain of an important animal model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; further, these tools will be applicable to diverse brain tissues and organisms. Ultimately, this infrastructure will therefore contribute to a qualitatively improved understanding of how neuronal circuits process and store information across phyla. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides a new and cutting-edge strategy to accelerate mapping of brain circuits at a synaptic level, a prerequisite to understanding circuit function in normal and diseased brains. The proposed infrastructure is relevant to the part of the BRAIN Initiative's mission that pertains to revolutionizing our understanding of brain function through tool development and improved data analysis technologies.","Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit",9822552,RF1MH120679,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automated Annotation', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'improved', 'information processing', 'infrastructure development', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'stereotypy', 'tool', 'tool development', 'tractography']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,RF1,2019,1910784,0.08269115656722031
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10157174,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Wing', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'male', 'markov model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'peanut butter', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.05952499174640965

"Neural population dynamics in premotor cortex during decision making Project Summary / Abstract Decision-making requires populations of neurons in the brain to collectively process sensory evidence and select appropriate behavioral responses. Neural population dynamics (NPDs), which describe how the responses of a population of individual neurons unfold over time, can provide an insightful view into these decision processes. Much is known about how individual neurons respond in select decision making tasks. However, little is known about how populations of neurons dynamically perform decision computations, and how resulting NPDs within a brain area are structured across many decision-making tasks. Shared features in NPDs across many tasks could indicate unifying neural mechanisms of computation that underlie the multi-functionality of a given neural circuit. This proposal aims to uncover the details and structure of these decision-related NPDs in human and nonhuman primate dorsal premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to both the function and dysfunction of decision making. Particular attention will be devoted to examining how NPDs are organized across multiple decision-making tasks and how those NPDs emerge during learning of new tasks. During the K99 phase, novel analytical tools will be developed for extracting NPDs from simultaneously recorded neural population activity and, importantly, for providing interpretable links between NPDs and their role in decision-related neural computation. With the goal of identifying unifying principles of decision-related computation, large-scale analyses will then integrate existing and newly collected neurophysiological datasets involving multiple decision-making tasks performed by humans and nonhuman primates. During the R00 phase, the proposed research will pivot toward understanding how NPDs emerge during learning to make new types of decisions. The proposal postulates that the ease, speed, and efficacy of learning all hinge on the extent by which critical neural circuits can leverage pre-existing neural mechanisms of computation. These concepts will be tested in collaborative human and nonhuman primate neu- rophysiological experiments, with guidance provided by interrogations of artificial neural networks posed with similar decision-related learning tasks. Upon completion, the proposed research will provide new fundamental knowledge concerning i) the multi-functional and adaptive role of premotor cortex across many decision-making tasks and ii) unifying principles of neural computation that support this flexibility. Better understanding decision- related circuits and their neural mechanisms could ultimately elucidate the basis for the numerous psychiatric disorders that impair decision making, which could eventually lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Our brain’s ability to generate decisions can be severely disrupted by psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. This proposal develops novel analytical and experimental approaches for understanding decision making at the level of populations of individual neurons in human and non-human primate premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to decision making. By integrating a large collection of new and existing datasets reflecting the involvement of premotor cortex in a wide range of decision- making tasks, the proposed research is expected to generate fundamental knowledge about unifying principles of decision-related neural computation, which may ultimately lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treat- ment of decision-impacting psychiatric conditions.",Neural population dynamics in premotor cortex during decision making,10018951,K99MH121533,"['Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,118314,0.10327399567284809

However, little is known about how populations of neurons dynamically perform decision computations, and how resulting NPDs within a brain area are structured across many decision-making tasks. Shared features in NPDs across many tasks could indicate unifying neural mechanisms of computation that underlie the multi-functionality of a given neural circuit. This proposal aims to uncover the details and structure of these decision-related NPDs in human and nonhuman primate dorsal premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to both the function and dysfunction of decision making. Particular attention will be devoted to examining how NPDs are organized across multiple decision-making tasks and how those NPDs emerge during learning of new tasks. During the K99 phase, novel analytical tools will be developed for extracting NPDs from simultaneously recorded neural population activity and, importantly, for providing interpretable links between NPDs and their role in decision-related neural computation. With the goal of identifying unifying principles of decision-related computation, large-scale analyses will then integrate existing and newly collected neurophysiological datasets involving multiple decision-making tasks performed by humans and nonhuman primates. During the R00 phase, the proposed research will pivot toward understanding how NPDs emerge during learning to make new types of decisions. The proposal postulates that the ease, speed, and efficacy of learning all hinge on the extent by which critical neural circuits can leverage pre-existing neural mechanisms of computation. These concepts will be tested in collaborative human and nonhuman primate neu- rophysiological experiments, with guidance provided by interrogations of artificial neural networks posed with similar decision-related learning tasks. Upon completion, the proposed research will provide new fundamental knowledge concerning i) the multi-functional and adaptive role of premotor cortex across many decision-making tasks and ii) unifying principles of neural computation that support this flexibility. Better understanding decision- related circuits and their neural mechanisms could ultimately elucidate the basis for the numerous psychiatric disorders that impair decision making, which could eventually lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Our brain’s ability to generate decisions can be severely disrupted by psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. This proposal develops novel analytical and experimental approaches for understanding decision making at the level of populations of individual neurons in human and non-human primate premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to decision making. By integrating a large collection of new and existing datasets reflecting the involvement of premotor cortex in a wide range of decision- making tasks, the proposed research is expected to generate fundamental knowledge about unifying principles of decision-related neural computation, which may ultimately lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treat- ment of decision-impacting psychiatric conditions.",Neural population dynamics in premotor cortex during decision making,9870842,K99MH121533,"['Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multitask', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,121494,0.10327399567284809
"Accessible technologies for high-throughput, whole-brain reconstructions of molecularly characterized mammalian neurons SUMMARY The BRAIN Initiative seeks to accelerate the development and application of innovative technologies that ultimately will revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. A central current focus of the brain initiative is to enable a swift and comprehensive survey of all brain cell types and circuits. Recently, single cell transcriptomics is helping to classify cell types by their expression patterns. Transcriptomic analysis is currently unique in that it scales to the entire mouse brain and all cell types. However, the correspondence between transcriptomic clusters and cell types, as defined by connectivity or physiology, is not clear. Classification of cell types will require integrative analysis of at least two data elements at the cellular level: (1) molecular signature (e.g., transcriptome), (2) anatomy (e.g., location, morphology, connectivity). We therefore propose here to elevate the complete reconstruction of the morphology of molecularly defined neurons from a small-scale artisanal method to a technology that scales to the analysis of all neuron types across the entire brain thereby providing critical information about cell types, neuronal structure and connectivity. To achieve this goal, we will build on an existing research partnership between the Departments of Neuroscience and Biomedial Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and Janelia Research Campus to develop novel tools for the reconstruction of molecularly defined neuronal subtypes. We will develop scalable imaging technology and neuro-informatics tools for morpho-molecular analysis that will be made available to researchers for a community wide effort of the mapping of all neuronal cell types and connections at and unprecedented scale and depth. Preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of our approach that will be further developed to enhance speed on a generally usable platform. We will also develop affordable tools for data storage and retrieval. Molecular identification of neurons is designed to take advantage of information from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to integrate data across platforms into a common Brain Atlas. Data collected in this proposal will be integrated into the searchable BICCN database at the Allen Brain Institute.

"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors.

"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10054745,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2020,196326,0.013362458587763602

"Using perceptual decision-making to understand the role of selective inhibitory activity in cortical computation Cortical circuits perform computations to generate appropriate behaviors based upon diverse sensory inputs. These computations are central to an animal maintaining its health and long- term survival. An example of this type of computation are perceptual decision-making tasks where an animal must weigh sensory evidence to choose a behavior which will elicit a reward. The classical circuit models of decision-making focus solely on the effects of recurrent excitation, treating inhibitory neurons as agnostic facilitators of competition between excitatory subpopulations. However, this view of inhibitory neurons is at odds with experiment results which show a diversity of interneuron tuning and connectivity across the cortex, recently in the decision-making context. I propose to develop new models of cortical decision-making circuits which parameterizes selectivity of connections between subpopulations within the excitatory and inhibitory populations to understand how selectivity shapes the attractor dynamics underlying decision-making and how these dynamics represent animal choice. Based on the analysis of these models, I will establish an updated theoretical framework for the neural circuit mechanisms of decision-making behaviors which more fully account the intricacies of cortical circuit structure and more fully represent the diversity of neuronal cell-types. The role of inhibitory selectivity in facilitating task learning will be investigated using artificial neural networks as a proxy. Finally, single cell resolution calcium activity will be measured from a labeled inhibitory cell-type. This work will address how circuit structure and cell-type shape population dynamics underlying decision-making and how local cortical processes generate meaningful behaviors. Complex cognitive processes such as perceptual decision-making arise through computations performed in cortical circuits. Models describing these computations often treat inhibitory neurons as agnostic facilitators of competition between excitatory populations. Using theoretical and single neuron resolution imaging of cortical population activity, this project aims to more fully account for the role of interneurons in cortical computation.",Using perceptual decision-making to understand the role of selective inhibitory activity in cortical computation,9991423,F32MH123011,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'two-photon']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2020,21881,0.1311084892692556
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,9991417,F32MH123012,"['ARNT gene', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Cloning', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73010,0.09546789385034488
"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,350546,0.04763363105924968
"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cre driver', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'anatomic imaging', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,2900000,0.09109807047660207
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. We propose here to pioneer the development of next-generation, vascularized brain organoids and to apply novel, scalable molecular and imaging tools to enable investigation of human neural circuits in health and disease.",High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids,10049677,RF1MH123977,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epitopes', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cell type', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'information processing', 'materials science', 'model design', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'synaptic pruning']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2509021,0.1017760081998836
"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,-0.007418636157990366
"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anxiety is characterized by a persistent and disruptive negative emotional state. This proposal will utilize pose estimation algorithms, unsupervised behavioral segmentation, neural population analyses, and simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging and input-specific optogenetic inhibition to investigate the mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety-like emotional states.

"Large-scale monitoring of circuits for adaptation and novelty detection in primary visual cortex Project Summary/Abstract  In a world filled with sensory information, the ability to filter out repetitive or redundant stimuli while still maintaining the ability to detect change in the environment is critical to biological success. Studies have characterized reduced cortical responses to repetitive stimuli (adaptation) and augmented cortical responses to stimuli that differ from these expected regularities (novelty detection); however, the cortical circuits that enable flexibly encoding stimuli based on the context in which they are experienced remain unknown. Disinhibitory microcircuits, especially those mediated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing inhibitory interneurons (VIPs), may play a role in this flexible coding by altering the inhibition supplied to principal excitatory neurons (PYRs) in neocortex. Despite this, the relationship between neural activity of VIPs and PYRs during adaptation and novelty detection remain poorly understood.  In this proposal, I seek to use fast dual-color, three-dimensional, two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neural activity of both VIPs and PYRs in primary visual cortex during a classic visual “oddball” paradigm (Aim 1). This paradigm presents the same stimulus in control, repetitive, and rare/deviant contexts, which enables directly recording neural responses to the same stimulus when it is an established regularity and when it is novel and thus deviates from established regularity. I will then use data and theory analysis tools to computationally model neocortical adaptation and novelty detection (Aim 2) by incorporating anatomical and neural recording data from PYRs and interneuron populations (including VIPs), which are often excluded from network models. The creation of this holistic model is likely to reveal fundamental circuitry that gives rise to flexible neural encoding of sensory stimuli. Finally, I will integrate optogenetic interventional tools for circuit manipulation with two-photon imaging to directly test the relationship between VIP neural activity and adaptation and novelty detection in PYRs. Altogether, these aims directly address several of the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goals: monitor neural activity, interventional tools, data and theory analysis, and integrated approaches. Furthermore, the experiments proposed under these aims will result in significant technical and theoretical training for the applicant and will advance essential understanding of how excitatory, inhibitory, and disinhibitory circuits across cortical layers diverge in their dynamic neural activity and differentially contribute to sensory processing. Project Narrative (3 sentences) The ability to filter repetitive sensory stimulation from conscious perception while remaining able to respond to changes in the environment is quintessential to successfully relating to the world in which one lives; however, the basic neural circuitry that enables this flexible encoding of sensory stimuli is poorly understood. Here we integrate state-of-the-art neurotechnologies to complete large-scale monitoring of neural activity with interventional tools to directly test relationships between genetically defined populations of cortical neurons and then incorporate them into a working computational neural network model. The model developed in this proposal will be distributed to the wider neuroscientific community and the results of the proposed aims will provide significant insight into context-dependent modulation of neural activity that is integral to normal nervous system function and is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric disease.",Large-scale monitoring of circuits for adaptation and novelty detection in primary visual cortex,10139328,F32MH125445,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Cortical Column', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'area striata', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'behavior test', 'career', 'cell type', 'deviant', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'lens', 'neocortical', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory mechanism', 'sensory stimulus', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,-0.01857377637235016
"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dopaminergic Cell', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Motor output', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Walking', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell cortex', 'cell type', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,0.01496464850599244
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,0.03536724467542109
