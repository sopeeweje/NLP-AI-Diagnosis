"SYSTEM FOR MACHINE READING OF CHEMICAL SYMBOLS This project will lead to the development of a proof-of-principle system for machine reading and understanding of hardcopy, graphical chemical structures.  This research will provide a basis for developing intelligent input devices for entry of chemical structure data into existing and future chemical information analysis and classification systems.  Such systems have applications for chemical patent searches, chemical design and analysis, and education.  Development of the proof-of-principle chemical structure reader will require a unique blend of current technologies, including electronic imaging, pattern recognition and analysis, and computer handling of chemical information.  The reader will be a microcomputer-based system using a CCD camera to capture page images consisting of chemical structure diagrams.  These images will be digitized and transmitted to the computer where the image data will be preprocessed into a format understandable by pattern recognition algorithms.  The algorithms will transform the data from a collection of graphic elements into chemical structure indices characterizing the chemical.  The specific goal of the Phase I effort will be to develop a system capable of automatically reading chemical structure diagrams from a limited set and correctly identifying the chemical.  n/a",SYSTEM FOR MACHINE READING OF CHEMICAL SYMBOLS,3497984,R43GM039007,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' mathematical model']",NIGMS,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R43,1988,50000,0.252308999
"INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  The project continues research into an integrated tool for documentation designed around the unique needs and communication language of biochemical researchers.  A software tool called ChemWriter will be implemented based on the Phase I research results. ChemWriter addresses the need of many health scientists to work with text, instrument data, and chemical structure diagrams in an integrated fashion. The software incorporates chemical intelligence to support and streamline the chemical structure diagramming process.  Structure diagram development and manipulation is enhanced by allowing users to work at differing conceptual levels--functional group, structural skeleton and molecular-- including the atomic level.  Libraries of each kind of structure are provided and the capability to create user-libraries.  Chemical intelligence is incorporated into each chemical structure or partial structure regardless of level, giving it knowledge of how and where bonds may form.  ChemWriter also supports importation of diagrams from chemical structure databases, and laboratory instrument data directly into documents.  The software is made machine independent through use of a common software architecture and a common interface, coded in the X- Windows display description language.  ChemWriter should increase researcher productivity, and speed dissemination of important research results.  n/a",INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS,3507967,R44GM042331,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment resource', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER HUMAN INTERFACE, INC.",R44,1990,264814,0.232001066
"KNOWLEDGE-BASED CHEMICAL SYMBOL RECOGNITION SYSTEM The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a functional, low-cost system for machine reading and recognition of chemical structure diagrams.  The specific Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing such a system using a knowledge-based approach which provides a logical method for expanding the chemical symbol recognition domain and for handling exceptions to recognition rules.  Prior work on system design, algorithm development and literature research supports our contention that developing a useable chemical reader is feasible.  the chemical reader will find application as an intelligent input device for entry of chemical structure data into chemical information systems.  Yearly, thousands of structures must be entered into large databases by specially trained persons.  In addition, searches of these databases by chemistry researchers often require input of structural information.  The chemical reader will enable entry of structural information via universally recognized diagrams instead of using system specific codes.  In this proposal we describe a knowledge- based approach to developing the chemical reader.  This approach has been successfully used by others in systems designed to recognize line drawings.  In the chemical reader system a knowledge base will be built which contains rules incorporating knowledge of chemistry and diagramming conventions.  The rules will use facts obtained from feature extractors operating on pattern primitives derived from 2D gray level images of structure diagrams.  the images can be acquired using either optical scanners or CCD camera/frame grabber devices.  The result of processing the structure diagram will be a connection table, the standard representation for chemical structures.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE-BASED CHEMICAL SYMBOL RECOGNITION SYSTEM,3498720,R43GM047173,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information retrieval']",NIGMS,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R43,1993,50000,0.22871281
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9902210,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,748733,0.214417233

"MCASE QSAR Expert System for Salmonella Mutagenicity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational expert systems provide an         inexpensive and fast alternative to short term genotoxicity assays such as the       Ames test. Validation studies show the predictive capability of the MCASE            system is about 85 percent. That is, 85 percent concordance is expected between      experiment and computational genotoxicity predictions for new chemicals. The         strong correlation between chemical structure and genotoxicity is particularly       useful for 'in silico' prescreening of new drugs in the pharmaceutical               industry.

"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION-INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall long-range objective is to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the family Callitrichidae, in social and sexual communication.  Studies are proposed to elucidate in detail those chemical patterns which encode gender and species.  A combination of analytical techniques, pattern recognition methods and behavioral assays will identify those components or patterns of compounds, both volatile and non-volatile, which are associated with the commmunicatory information.  Bacteriological studies will determine which of the active components are of bacterial origin. In addition, a pilot study will assess the possible role of the fatty acids in encoding individual differences in the scent marks.  We anticipate that this research will lead to a much more complete understanding of the nature of the chemical code in this primate species, and in the end that it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations a variety of the communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal, a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and two bacteriologists, as well as a pattern recognition expert has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  The proposed studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.

"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION-INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall long-range objective is to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the family Callitrichidae, in social and sexual communication.  Studies are proposed to elucidate in detail those chemical patterns which encode gender and species.  A combination of analytical techniques, pattern recognition methods and behavioral assays will identify those components or patterns of compounds, both volatile and non-volatile, which are associated with the commmunicatory information.  Bacteriological studies will determine which of the active components are of bacterial origin. In addition, a pilot study will assess the possible role of the fatty acids in encoding individual differences in the scent marks.  We anticipate that this research will lead to a much more complete understanding of the nature of the chemical code in this primate species, and in the end that it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations a variety of the communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.

The etiology of most chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental and genetic factors.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.

"Development of a Novel Membrane Protein Solubilization/Stabilization Screen ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing output of new integral membrane protein (IMP) structures is partially due to the availability of an increasing number of chemical variables such as detergents, detergent-like molecules, lipids, and solubilizing/stabilizing additives. It is clear that specific combinations and concentrations of these different variables are often necessary to improve IMP solubility/stability and crystallization. For each IMP studied, researchers typically explore (via a trial and error approach) many of these chemical variables. However, there is limited understanding of the importance and effect of specific combinations/concentrations of these chemical variables on IMP extraction, solubilization/stabilization, purification and crystallization. We propose to use our novel technology and approach, high-throughput self-interaction chromatography (HSC) combined with an incomplete factorial screen and artificial neural network analysis to discover new formulations that improve/optimize IMP solubility and physical stability (IMP homogeneity). This phase-1 proposal will perform a pilot study on seven different IMPs including the chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CCR1), epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), acid sensing ion channel (ASIC), P- glycoprotein (Pgp), bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ferric yersiniabactin uptake receptor (FIP). The HSC approach involves rapid experimental determination of second viral coefficient values (B- values) for an incomplete factorial of the total possible number of chemical combinations and concentrations for each IMP. This is followed by input and analysis via an artificial neural network (ANN) program that, once ""trained"", produces B-value predictions for a complete factorial of possible chemical combinations and concentrations. Chemical conditions associated with the most positive B-value predictions (suggesting improved solubility and physical stability) are then experimentally validated via HSC measurements followed by evaluation of the IMP's stability/folding (via differential scanning calorimetry, Western gels, CD and when available, bio- assays), solubility and stability in several of these solutions. It is possible that the proposed comprehensive analysis of chemical variables will result in new combinations and/or concentrations that may become useful ""cocktails"" to be included in screening solubility and stability new IMPs within the same class of IMPs. However, the major goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the value of the HSC technology and approach to determine novel and improved solubilization/stabilization solutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Researchers typically explore a variety of detergents and detergent/lipid combinations in attempts to enable isolation, purification of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) to support biological, drug discovery and structural biology studies. IMPs, important proteins involved in human disease, are the targets of more than 50% of all drugs currently under development. The inability to express, solubilize and purify homogeneous preparations represents a major bottleneck in IMP research adversely affecting drug development pipeline. This proposal involves use of a novel technology and experimental approach to determine novel combinations and concentrations of existing detergents and additives that can improve the solubility, stability and crystallization of IMPs.            ",Development of a Novel Membrane Protein Solubilization/Stabilization Screen,8831266,R41GM109565,"['ASIC channel', 'Affect', 'Bacteriorhodopsins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Crystallization', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Detergents', 'Development', 'Differential Scanning Calorimetry', 'Drug Formulations', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excipients', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Lipids', 'Measurement', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sodium Channel', 'Solubility', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Viral', 'chemokine receptor', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'epithelial Na+ channel', 'human disease', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'uptake', 'yersiniabactin']",NIGMS,"SOLUBLE THERAPEUTICS, INC.",R41,2015,153004,0.147781918
"KNOWLEDGE-BASED FRAMEWORK TO AUTOMATE HAZOP ANALYSIS Hazard and operability (Hazop) analysis is the study of systematically identifying every conceivable deviation, all the possible abnormal causes for such deviation, and the adverse hazardous consequences of that deviation in a chemical plant. Modern chemical plants are extremely complex and hence are difficult to analyze and assess from this Hazop perspective, thus raising serious occupational safety related concerns. Because of this complexity, they are also more vulnerable to equipment failures, as witnessed by the recent chemical plant accidents. The major goal of this proposal is to develop a knowledge-based system framework for automating Hazop analysis of process plants. Such automated systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants. Hazop analysis is often carried out by a group of experts poring over the process flowsheets for weeks or months. Thus, Hazop analysis is a very difficult, labor-intensive, and time-consuming process. In our proposed knowledge-based framework, we recognize and exploit two important features of the Hazop analysis: (i) even though each Hazop analysis is unique-to a process, it is systematic and logical; and (ii) many aspects of the analysis are the same for different process flow sheets. Thus, Hazop analysis can be automated through the use of knowledge-based systems. In this project, we propose a knowledge-based systems approach which introduces several novel techniques in a model-based framework to attack this problem. These are: (i) decomposing the knowledge-base into process specific and process general knowledge, (ii) developing generic cause-and-effect models of various processes and process equipments, and (iii) an object-oriented implementation framework. We have successfully tested the proposed approach on a small prototypical case study. Encouraged by the preliminary results, we propose to investigate this approach further by developing more comprehensive generic models library of complex process equipments, process interactions, process materials, and by testing on complex industrial scale Hazop case studies.

"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"NEURAL SYSTEMS THAT EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM DATABASES The intent of this project is to develop a method of automatically programming neural-networks to extract needed information from databases of biological and chemical information.  The specific application example we will pursue in Phase I will be the creation of a framework for training a neural network to predict the toxic and carcinogenic properties of chemicals using data stored in the Organ Toxicity Database.  The neural network will be trained to recognize patterns and correlations between chemical structure/substructures, physiochemical properties, and toxicologic/carcinogenic findings stored in the electronic compilation of a large subset of NTP TR and NTP TOX documents.  A system which automatically selects the pertinent data fields for accurately predicting toxicity and then trains a neural network will be developed.  The ability of the resulting neural network to predict the carcinogenic and toxic properties of known liver and kidney toxicants and carcinogens will be evaluated during Phase I. If accurate prediction is achieved, we will build a generalized framework for extending our techniques to other types of biological and chemical databases during Phase II.  The value of many databases will be greatly increased by the availability of methods to automatically create neural networks which extract needed information for various applications.  For example, our toxicity prediction system would reduce the exposure of the general public to possibly hazardous chemicals, would allow chemical manufacturers to quickly determine the hazards of new and existing products, and would same enormous amounts of time and money currently spent on animal testing.  Each application developed using our framework could offer similar benefits.  n/a",NEURAL SYSTEMS THAT EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM DATABASES,2104250,R43CA062795,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical carcinogen', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure function', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' toxicology information system']",NCI,NOVEL PHARMACEUTICALS,R43,1994,80768,0.13803915
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs.

"Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications.           n/a",Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC,7270029,R44RR020256,"['Air', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Technology', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Soil', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Today', 'Trademark', 'Urine', 'Water', 'base', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'commercial application', 'comparative', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'research and development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"GC IMAGE, LLC",R44,2007,239373,0.125810404
"Crowdsourcing Phenotypes - Diversity Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bringing new drugs to market is a lengthy and expensive endeavor. To increase the number of affordable new drugs available to consumers at reasonable costs, the efficiency of the drug development process must be greatly improved. We aim to develop a novel tool that addresses this challenge by rapid identification of drug targets and drug candidates for any given clinical phenotype utilizing our newly developed computational method. This method is based on a hypothesis that the tissue pattern of the expression of drug targets is essential for the unbiased matching of phenotypes to potential drugs. Matching complex molecular biomarkers of a disease to drugs thus depends on knowledge of the complete molecular signature (polypharmacologic fingerprint) of the drug or drug combination. Our approach is based on integration of large datasets from chemical and 'omics' databases and developing algorithms to link clinical phenotypes with drugs and drug-like chemicals. This is achieved by identifying the polypharmacologic profile of bioactive drugs and matching this drug-based profile to a phenotype-based tissue profile of a disease, which is derived from the computational analysis of 'omics' data. We have already developed and validated the 'drug' module of this system. Here we propose to (a) develop the 'phenotype' module, which will include the phenotype-tissue-target data via integration of clinical phenotypes, tissue-specific target expression, and GWAS and microarray data; (b) develop 'matching' algorithms for the modules that will build a direct link between drugs and clinical phenotypes as well as a ranking system for those matches; (c) validate this system using well-established clinical phenotypes and drugs for their treatment. When completed, the proposed research will result in a system that will allow users to instantly identify the ranked list of predicted drugs for any given clinical phenotype. Alternatively, it can be used to identify a list f phenotypes associated with any given drug/compound or drug/compound combination.

"Novel tool for linking drugs and phenotypes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bringing new drugs to market is a lengthy and expensive endeavor. To increase the number of affordable new drugs available to consumers at reasonable costs, the efficiency of the drug development process must be greatly improved. We aim to develop a novel tool that addresses this challenge by rapid identification of drug targets and drug candidates for any given clinical phenotype utilizing our newly developed computational method. This method is based on a hypothesis that the tissue pattern of the expression of drug targets is essential for the unbiased matching of phenotypes to potential drugs. Matching complex molecular biomarkers of a disease to drugs thus depends on knowledge of the complete molecular signature (polypharmacologic fingerprint) of the drug or drug combination. Our approach is based on integration of large datasets from chemical and 'omics' databases and developing algorithms to link clinical phenotypes with drugs and drug-like chemicals. This is achieved by identifying the polypharmacologic profile of bioactive drugs and matching this drug-based profile to a phenotype-based tissue profile of a disease, which is derived from the computational analysis of 'omics' data. We have already developed and validated the 'drug' module of this system. Here we propose to (a) develop the 'phenotype' module, which will include the phenotype-tissue-target data via integration of clinical phenotypes, tissue-specific target expression, and GWAS and microarray data; (b) develop 'matching' algorithms for the modules that will build a direct link between drugs and clinical phenotypes as well as a ranking system for those matches; (c) validate this system using well-established clinical phenotypes and drugs for their treatment. When completed, the proposed research will result in a system that will allow users to instantly identify the ranked list of predicted drugs for any given clinical phenotype. Alternatively, it can be used to identify a list f phenotypes associated with any given drug/compound or drug/compound combination.

"INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR WORKING WITH CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS The proposed efforts initiates research into an integrated tool for research documentation designed around the unique needs and communication language of biochemical researchers.  A computer system called ChemWriter will be implemented in Phase II from the Phase I design.  ChemWriter addresses the need of many health scientists to work with text, quantitative data, and chemical structure diagrams in an integrated fashion.  Existing tools offer only piece-meal and non-integratable solutions.  ChemWriter would enhance the research documentation process, increase researcher productivity, and speed dissemination of important research results.  The design for Chemwriter is developed through a methodology for human-computer interface design originated and successfully applied by the proposed principal investigator.  The methodology focuses on analyzing the functional needs of the specialist in the application domain (i.e., the biochemical researcher), and designing the user interface to fit these needs.  Software 'form' is then designed to the use-oriented function of the interface.  ChemWriter will incorporate elements of chemical intelligence to support and streamline the chemical structure diagram drawing process, and will be largely machine independent through use of the emerging technology of display description languages.  The chief innovation offered is applying a new design methodology to the fundamental information processing problems of biochemical professionals.  n/a",INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR WORKING WITH CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS,3498348,R43GM042331,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment resource', ' chemical information system', ' computer system design /evaluation']",NIGMS,"CHI SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,1989,46154,0.123163881
"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate new approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems.  Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  Industrial statistics show that even though major catastrophies and disasters from chemical plant failures are infrequent, minor accidents are very common, occurring on a day to day basis, resulting in many occupational injuries and illnesses, costing the society billions of dollars every year.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble- shooting.  We propose to improve this status by designing systems that would have better modeling of the problem-solving process through an appropriate representation of the domain knowledge through the use of causal modeling and reasoning from first principles, similar to human experts, by exploiting some of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence.  We propose a methodology that aids the development of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, resilient under unforeseen fault combinations, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults.  The domain knowledge of the system is based on a library of fault and causal models of process equipments as well as on the physical interconnections between equipment units and causal relationships among process state variables.  The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior.  We describe a prototype expert system, called MODEX, based on our methodology.  The system has performed successfully on test cases of prototypical chemical process plants and looks promising.  However, before a successful transfer of this methodology to the industry can be initiated a number of research issues outlined in the proposal need to be resolved by experimenting with larger prototypical chemical plants.  n/a",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY,3420587,R01OH002352,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' industry', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' occupational hazard', ' occupational psychology', ' safety equipment']",NIOSH,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,1989,59219,0.116635754

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately.

Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,9589783,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2018,1076717,0.107893763
"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced. In most cases, these safety assessments are performed using the Draize Rabbit Eye test, resulting in thousands of rabbits used in testing every year.

"Systematic data curation and integration to link models of human disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of experiments have produced vast amounts of data and identified a multitude of molecular processes that underlie specific biological functions directly relevant to human health. However, the potential of these data to inform about human health and disease have not yet been fully realized because publications report results in natural language that is not easily identifiable or computable. To capture and interrogate this wealth of data from the literature, we developed the BioGRID, an open repository for molecular interactions. BioGRID is a widely used resource, with on average over 6,500 unique visitors per month who explore the > 360,000 interactions in the database with custom search and visualization tools. In addition, BioGRID data sets are the source of interaction information for a host of partner databases. An analogous challenge exists with the description of models of human disease. While much information is available from years of research in powerful models of human disease, including yeast, nematode, fly, zebrafish and mouse models, the relationship of these models to each other and to human disease has not been systematically organized. In this and other proposals connected through the Linking Animal Models to Human Disease Initiative (LAMHDl), we will undertake a systematic, coordinated effort to expand the BioGRID database through curation of pivotal new data compendia, application of sophisticated new methods for data integration, organization of data into predicted networks, and critically, linkage of networks between model systems and human disease processes. Our curation effort will comprehensively annotate RNAi phenotype data and chemical genetic data, which are crucial for accurate models of human disease and therapeutic intervention in disease, respectively. We will apply data analysis techniques to integrate these and other data across species to link human diseases with all relevant models to predict new features of human disease. We will also develop software tools to allow facile access of the research community to all of these results. Thus, we will enable the biomedical community to access fully comprehensive, integrated datasets across multiple models for hypothesis generation and analysis of human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): We will collect a unique and extensive set of protein and gene interactions from models that are relevant to human disease, as well as their interactions with chemicals (drugs) and their effect on specific functions. These data will allow the prediction of new disease network functions using specialized algorithms, which will lead to a better understanding of human disease and facilitate the discovery of new drugs.           (provided by applicant): We will collect a unique and extensive set of protein and gene interactions from models that are relevant to human disease, as well as their interactions with chemicals (drugs) and their effect on specific functions.

"Electroanalysis of Neurotransmitters and Modulators The goals of this research proposal are to develop electrochemistry-based probes and ancillary tools to monitor neurotransmitters and other chemical substances in intact, functional brain tissue. Real-time measurements of chemical changes in the brain enable the regulatory kinetics and mechanisms to be . unravelled, and they also allow investigation of the alteration of these mechanisms by disease or drugs of abuse. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes will be employed with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Developed in the previous project periods, this approach provides a dynamic view of neurotransmitters relaying information in the brain. The major target neurotransmitter is dopamine, and the metabolic indicators, molecular oxygen and local pH, will also be monitored. The specific aims involve new technology (Aims 1, 2, and 5) and innovative applications (Aims 3 and 4). They are: 1. To employ principle component analysis of cyclic voltammograms collected in vivo to extract the major contributors to the electrochemical signal. This will improve signal-to-noise ratios and will separate pH and dopamine changes. Its use will allow further insight into the changes induced by cocaine and cannabinoids. 2. To develop and use iontophoresis with voltammetry to introduce chemical substances directly at the site where pH and dopamine measurements are made. This will allow local mechanisms that regulate dopamine release and uptake to be probed. In freely moving animals, the local injections will avoid whole animal effects of injected pharmacological agents. 3. To investigate dopamine release from its cell bodies. Measurements will be made in the ventral tegmental area while antidromically activating dopamine fibers. The mechanisms that control release and uptake will be contrasted with those in the terminal regions. 4. To investigate dopamine neurotransmission and pH changes in a model of a disease state. R6/2 mice, a genetic model of Huntington's disease, will be used. Preliminary data indicate dopamine neurotransmission is impaired in these animals. We will investigate the origin of this impairment and probe regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmission and regulatin of pH. 5. To develop carbon electrodes with greater flexibility and less fragility. The proposed design uses various forms of carbon deposited on the tips of tungstem wires.

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types. Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy. In this grant, we propose to: develop RPS19 and RPS10 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes ('phenoprints') using our drug discovery platform; conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on-target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS19 and RPS10; expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non-adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD34+ suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds arising from the project. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disease for which no targeted therapy exists. Loss of function in RPS19 and RPS10, or other ribosomal protein genes, results in the disease. We will use chemical suppressor screens of known drugs, based on structural changes in cellular disease models, to identify potential therapeutics for treatment of DBA.            ",HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments,8902889,R43HL127820,"['A549', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD34 gene', 'Cavernous Malformation', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diamond-Blackfan anemia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Erythrocytes', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hydrops Fetalis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'RNA Interference', 'Rare Diseases', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Stem cells', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'bone marrow failure syndrome', 'cell type', 'disease phenotype', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'early onset', 'erythroid differentiation', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'new technology', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'public health relevance', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'working group']",NHLBI,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R43,2015,217352,0.088797443
"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

"Vibrational Photoacoustic Microscopy for Bond-selective Tissue Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long term goal of our research is pursuing new understanding of molecular functions in health and disease via development of label-free microscopy. In this R21 application, we develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic (VPA) microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Our method is based on excitation of molecular overtone vibration and acoustic detection of the resultant pressure waves in the tissue. Our approach is significant in the following aspects: (i) Overtone excitation provides chemical bond selectivity and spectroscopic information in a label-free manner. (ii) Acoustic detection eliminates the tissue scattering problem encountered in near-infrared spectroscopy and enables depth-resolved signal collection in one scan. (iii) Our method provides a tissue penetration depth of a few mm, which is not accessible with existing vibrational microscopies. By excitation of the second overtone of the C-H bond stretch around 8300 cm-1, where blood interference is minimal, we have demonstrated preliminary VPA imaging of tissue phantoms and atherosclerotic plaques in arteries with a penetration depth in mm scale. These results show the great potential of developing VPA microscopy and endoscopy for label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of lipid-related disorders in live animals and eventually in patients. The two specific aims are (1) developing high-speed VPA microscopy for in vivo molecular imaging and quantitative analysis and (2) developing VPA spectroscopy and endoscopy for in situ, depth resolved characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. Successful development of VPA microscopy should provide a new platform enabling label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of biological specimen ex vivo and in vivo. Towards diagnosis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, VPA spectroscopy aided with principal component analysis should allow determination of lesion stages owing to the capability of identifying different pathophysiological compositions throughout deep tissues. Furthermore, our endoscopy development is expected to push the VPA method towards intravital imaging of plaques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: (provided by applicant): Intravital imaging of vulnerable plaques in cardiovascular diseases is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and/or chemical selectivity of current imaging tools. We develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Successful development of an intravascular vibrational photoacoustic probe holds the potential of detecting vulnerable plaques in a label free manner.           (provided by applicant): Intravital imaging of vulnerable plaques in cardiovascular diseases is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and/or chemical selectivity of current imaging tools.

"NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PROCESS FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate a new approach based on the emerging technology of Neural Networks in the discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems. Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry.  Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble-shooting.  In this project, we propose a novel methodology using Neural Networks that address the important issues which are central to the development of knowledge-based systems for process fault diagnosis and hazard control.  Our methodology for developing knowledge-based systems rests on the important characteristics of neural networks, namely, their ability to automatically classify and learn associations between input and output data and to be able to handle noisy data.  We have already successfully tested our approach on a prototypical case study based on real-plant data, that of fluidized catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) in operation in an Exxon refinery.  We plan to investigate this approach further by experimenting with larger prototypes of chemical process plants with more realistic, complex, models for the various units such as reactors, heat exchangers, distillation columns etc.  We also plan to explore the robustness of such systems for incomplete and uncertain data.  n/a",NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PROCESS FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND SAFETY,2277594,R01OH002740,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemicals', ' industry', ' injury prevention', ' occupational hazard', ' occupational health /safety']",NIOSH,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,1993,82901,0.086507076

The overriding theme of this interdisciplinary research PPG is protein-ligand, protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. This PPG will depend on a combination of experimental strategies involving whole animal models, and biochemical and molecular biological methods; a variety of biophysical methods including mass spectrometry and kinetics to address questions relating to regulation in the immune system and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix; nitration of proteins by peroxynitrite; and signaling pathways in RA-dependent transcription factors. These studies will specifically focus on: (1) identifying the signaling pathways in T lymphocytes that are altered by TCDD-induced AhR activation leading to T cell dysfunction, (2) determining the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility by PDGF, (3) elucidating the mechanisms by which oxidation of proteins by peroxynitrite interferes with protein-protein interactions, (4) investigating the role of GRASP and the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), in signaling pathways induced by RA, and (5) elucidating the mechanisms and dynamics involved in RA receptor-mediated gene expression induced by RA, methoprene acid, and other agonists.

This PPG will depend on a combination of experimental strategies involving whole animal models, and biochemical and molecular biological methods; a variety of biophysical methods including mass spectrometry and kinetics to address questions relating to regulation in the immune system and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix; nitration of proteins by peroxynitrite; and signaling pathways in RA-dependent transcription factors. These studies will specifically focus on: (1) identifying the signaling pathways in T lymphocytes that are altered by TCDD-induced AhR activation leading to T cell dysfunction, (2) determining the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility by PDGF, (3) elucidating the mechanisms by which oxidation of proteins by peroxynitrite interferes with protein-protein interactions, (4) investigating the role of GRASP and the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), in signaling pathways induced by RA, and (5) elucidating the mechanisms and dynamics involved in RA receptor-mediated gene expression induced by RA, methoprene acid, and other agonists. Experimental approaches to be used include flow cytometry, UV circular dichroism, fluorescence, quench and stopped-flow kinetics, and new techniques developed under the existing PPG (ES00040), including high speed cell sorting, a differential proteolytic sensitivity assay, H/D exchange, and singular value decomposition for analyzing multistate unfolding events at equilibrium.

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping.

"Predictive QSAR Modeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of this project is to develop, validate, and deliver efficient computational tools for rapid and reliable prediction of biological activity and/or related pharmaceutical properties of drug-like molecules. We plan to develop statistically significant and robust Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) methodologies, which incorporate rigorous validation procedures and lead to models with a high predictive power and practical utility. The methodologies are built upon the similarity principle, i.e., similarity or diversity of chemical structures determines similarity or diversity of their biological action. We argue that chemical similarity should be evaluated in the context of the target property and employ objective similarity and diversity functions to achieve biologically meaningful clustering of compounds in the descriptor space. Consequently, our methodologies employ variable selection procedures aimed at identifying descriptors most relevant with respect to the target property. Paramount to our approach is rigorous model validation with external datasets which ensures the highest hit rates when predictive QSAR models are ultimately applied to screening chemical databases or virtual libraries for biologically active compounds. Four major areas of concentration in this proposal corresponding to its Specific Aims include: . development of novel, mainly non-linear QSAR methods, such as k nearest neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) approaches. The emphasis will be on the development of novel descriptors of chemical structure, and the efficiency, automation and statistical robustness of the underlying methodologies to afford their application to large commercial datasets. . development of efficient and objective QSAR model validation methodologies, which define the domain of model applicability and maximize the predictive ability of the models. This studies should lead to establishing widely accepted ""good practices"" of reliable and extensively validated QSAR models. . application of validated QSAR modeling methods to various datasets of pharmacological or pharmaceutical significance in collaboration with experimental investigators; this part also includes the development of new approaches for effective data analysis and model interpretation based on advanced algorithms for data compression and mapping from high- to low dimensional descriptor space. . implementation of all modeling methods developed and validated in the course of this work in the publicly accessible UNC QSAR web server.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.070337159
"Vibrational Photoacoustic Microscopy for Bond-selective Tissue Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long term goal of our research is pursuing new understanding of molecular functions in health and disease via development of label-free microscopy. In this R21 application, we develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic (VPA) microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Our method is based on excitation of molecular overtone vibration and acoustic detection of the resultant pressure waves in the tissue. Our approach is significant in the following aspects: (i) Overtone excitation provides chemical bond selectivity and spectroscopic information in a label-free manner. (ii) Acoustic detection eliminates the tissue scattering problem encountered in near-infrared spectroscopy and enables depth-resolved signal collection in one scan. (iii) Our method provides a tissue penetration depth of a few mm, which is not accessible with existing vibrational microscopies. By excitation of the second overtone of the C-H bond stretch around 8300 cm-1, where blood interference is minimal, we have demonstrated preliminary VPA imaging of tissue phantoms and atherosclerotic plaques in arteries with a penetration depth in mm scale. These results show the great potential of developing VPA microscopy and endoscopy for label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of lipid-related disorders in live animals and eventually in patients. The two specific aims are (1) developing high-speed VPA microscopy for in vivo molecular imaging and quantitative analysis and (2) developing VPA spectroscopy and endoscopy for in situ, depth resolved characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. Successful development of VPA microscopy should provide a new platform enabling label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of biological specimen ex vivo and in vivo. Towards diagnosis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, VPA spectroscopy aided with principal component analysis should allow determination of lesion stages owing to the capability of identifying different pathophysiological compositions throughout deep tissues. Furthermore, our endoscopy development is expected to push the VPA method towards intravital imaging of plaques.        (provided by applicant): Intravital imaging of vulnerable plaques in cardiovascular diseases is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and/or chemical selectivity of current imaging tools. We develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Successful development of an intravascular vibrational photoacoustic probe holds the potential of detecting vulnerable plaques in a label free manner.

Successful development of an intravascular vibrational photoacoustic probe holds the potential of detecting vulnerable plaques in a label free manner.

"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context. This research proposes to develop an automated software platform that utilizes available data to develop and analyze mathematical models of complex processes in an automated fashion, resulting in the identification of critical intracellular processes.             n/a",A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using,7482734,R43GM084890,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Title', 'Universities', 'Urination', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical kinetics', 'commercialization', 'editorial', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R43,2008,99571,0.06513081
"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research.

"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail.

While chemical and mechanical signals, alone or in combination, can indeed lead to improved tissue growth as measured by material/mechanical properties, the current paradigm of applying these signals at fixed levels for the entire period of tissue growth is almost certainly suboptimal. The vision for the proposed project is to develop a rational basis for optimizing in vitro tissue growth via combined chemical and mechanical stimulation that does not require knowledge of the signal generation and transduction mechanisms, which are so daunting in complexity that a ""first principles"" model is unrealizable for the foreseeable future. It is inspired by a systems biology approach recently advanced by Janes and Lauffenburger (Janes, Kelly et al. 2004) based on principal component analysis and discriminate partial least squares regression that we will extend to determine a statistical relation between long-term ""downstream"" cell responses of interest (collagen and elastin production and associated tissue mechanical properties) and a subset of short-term ""upstream"" intracellular signals (i.e. phosphorylated proteins) that are generated due to extracellular stimuli. Having determined this ""signal-response reduction"" from a series of long-term step-response experiments on cells subject to various concentrations of chemical (e.g. TGF-b1) and mechanical (stretching) stimulation, an ""experimental steepest descent"" strategy will then be implemented to drive the cells as they grow a tissue to produce the maximum amount of collagen and elastin, which should maximize the tissue strength and modulus while imparting elasticity. This will be accomplished by periodically performing short-term step-response (""interrogation"") experiments in situ and using the predetermined reduction to predict the optimal combination of TGF-b1 concentration and stretching conditions for the subsequent incubation period, after which the tissue is again interrogated and the optimal conditions are again updated, and so on. If successful, this paradigm would dramatically change the field of tissue engineering and likely elucidate signaling pathways that lead to deposition of extracellular matrix components.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Few attempts to grow functional tissue replacements have succeeded.

"Estrogen receptor control of inflammatory gene expression Menopause induces systemic inflammation that contributes to impaired endocrine and bone function, metabolic disease, obesity, as well as autoimmunity and cognitive decline. These observations highlight a critical need to understand the relationship between estrogen signaling and inflammation. The overarching problem in both our basic understanding and therapeutic targeting of nuclear receptors remains an almost complete lack of understanding of how small differences in ligands can drive widely different transcriptional outcomes, including pathway and tissue-selective signaling. The goal is to define the chemical, structural, and molecular rules for how the estrogen receptor-α (ERα) ligands control inflammatory gene expression through binding directly or indirectly to DNA and altering coregulator recruitment, which in turn controls gene expression. A systems biology approach to chemical biology and structural biology will be used to reveal rules for how ligands achieve signaling specificity. Specific Aim 1. Discover and characterize the epigenetic regulome that mediates differential effects of ERα ligands on the inflammatory response. Functional genomics approaches will be used to identify three sets of inflammatory gene sets that we hypothesize will show distinct rules for gene control: 1) TNF-induced, E2 modulated genes with composite ERE/κB sites 2) TNF-induced, E2 modulated genes with ERα tethering to κB response elements; and 3) TNF-induce genes where ERα bounds but does not modulate. We will pick 3-4 representative genes from each category to target with an shRNA screen targeting all coregulators (~1200 shRNAmir targeting ~300 genes) to identify those required for ERα modulation. Coregulator-ERα interaction screens will be built and profiled with a compound library of 500 ERα ligands. Statistical models will enable identification of specific coregulator interactions that predict the inflammatory response to different classes of ligands and ties them to specific structural perturbations. Specific Aim 2. Identify the chemical and structural rules by which ERα transduces chemical structure into recruitment of specific signaling complexes that control inflammatory gene expression. Analysis of >100 crystal structures will be used to compute all atom distance matrices and use principal component analysis and multiple linear regression to identify ligand-induced perturbations that predict (1) regulation of specific genes, and (2) interaction with specific coregulators defined in Specific Aim 1. Impact: This work will identify structural rules for how ERα ligands differentially regulate inflammatory gene expression through the ligand-receptor interface allosterically controlling recruitment of an ensemble of specific coregulatory complexes. Identifying causal models for how ligands achieve signaling specificity impacts drug discovery and our understanding of the physiology underlying a variety of hormone-sensitive physiological systems and disease states, and should be readily translatable to other allosteric signaling systems including other nuclear receptors and GPCRs.   Following menopause, systemic and localized inflammation contribute to a suite of changes attributed to loss of estrogenic signaling, including obesity, autoimmunity, diabetes, and impaired endocrine and bone function, while there are important gender differences across human diseases with central inflammatory components, including infectious and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. The goal of this proposal is to define how different small molecule ligands of the estrogen receptor-α bind to the receptor and induce ligand-specific effects on controlling inflammatory genes.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS The major objective of this work is the application of digital computers to the derivation of synthetic pathways to complex organic structures. A general problem-solving program, LHASA (Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis), is being developed which can be used interactively by a chemist with simple graphical input-output of structural formulas.  The principles and strategies of organic synthesis are being formalized for use by the program.  A variety of strategies including long-range search capabilities are being employed in the program.  In addition, the vast range of information on synthetic chemistry is being organized and rationalized to provide a rich and effective knowledge base.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts.

"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,9868821,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69554,0.04512717
"Predictive QSAR Modeling  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this project is to develop, validate, and deliver efficient computational tools for rapid and reliable prediction of biological activity and/or related pharmacological or pharmaceutical properties of drug-like molecules. We plan to develop statistically significant and robust Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships(QSAR) methodologies, which incorporate rigorous validation procedures and lead to models with a high predictive power and practical utility. The QSAR approaches are based on the SAR premise: similarity or diversity of chemical structures determines similarity or diversity of their biological action. We argue that formal assessment of chemical similarity or diversity in terms of various chemically relevant molecular descriptors may be inadequate in case of QSAR modeling because the relative association of descriptors with target property (biological activity) is not known a priori. We suggest that the similarity (diversity) should be evaluated in the context of the target property and employ objective similarity and diversity functions to achieve biologically meaningful clustering of compounds in the descriptor space. Therefore, our methodologies employ variable selection procedures aimed at identifying descriptors that are most relevant with respect to the target property. Rigorous model validation ensures the highest hit rates (i.e., the highest content of biologically active compounds in the top scoring compounds) when predictive QSAR models are ultimately applied to screening  chemical databases or virtual libraries. Four major areas of concentration in this proposal are: development of novel, mainly non-linear QSAR methods, such as k nearest neighbor (kNN) QSAR approach, applicable to very large datasets. The emphasis will be on the development of novel descriptors of chemical structure,and the efficiency, automation and statistical robustness of the underlying methodologies. development of efficient and objective QSAR model validation methodologies, which maximize the predictive ability of the models and ensure their accuracy in rational design of focused libraries and database mining applications. application of validated QSAR modeling methods to various datasets of pharmacological or pharmaceutical importance; this part also includes the development of new approaches for effective data analysis and model interpretation based on advanced algorithms for data compression and mapping from high- to low dimensional descriptor space. implementation of all modeling methods developed and validated in the course of this work in the publicly accessible UNC QSAR web server. Successful implementation of this proposal is expected to afford highly automated and predictive QSAR modeling tools, which will benefit a broad research community working in the area of drug design and discovery.   n/a",Predictive QSAR Modeling,6792943,R01GM066940,[' '],NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,37803,0.037239695
"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7537117,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,97690,0.037146226
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.032686566
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,0.030502261
"QUANTIFYING NITROARENE GENOTOXICITY IN COMPLEX MIXTURES The biological activity of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroarenes) has ben the subject of extensive study primarily because of the potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some nitroarenes as well as their widespread occurrence in the environment, principally as the result of incomplete combustion processes.  However, most of us are not exposed primarily to individual compounds but rather to complex mixtures both outdoors (emissions from automobiles, power plants, etc.) and indoors (cigarette smoke, heaters, stoves, ovens etc).  The objective of the work proposed in this application is to relate the genotoxic and carcinogenic activities of individual nitroarenes to activities of artificial mixtures and extracts of emission particulates in order to use data for single chemicals to evaluate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures.  The proposed project, which employs both computerized and experimental methodologies, will involve professionals with expertise in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, artificial intelligence and risk assessment, and with extensive experience in the study of nitroarenes.  Two computerized techniques will be used.  First, Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (CASE), an artificial intelligence program which was developed to predict the mutagenicity of nitroarenes, will be used to identify structural determinants of mutagenicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Second, the Carcinogenicity Prediction and Battery Selection (CPBS) method will used to identify appropriate batteries of short-term tests for screening individual nitroarenes and mixtures and to predict potential carcinogenicity, including carcinogenic potency.  Experimental studies will be directed towards assessing the activities of compounds in mixtures.  Artificial mixtures of pairs of nitroarenes or related compounds, as well as extracts of combustion emissions combined with individual chemicals, will be tested for mutagenicity, metabolic activation and deactivation of mutagenicity, mammalian genotoxicity and metabolic biotransformation.

"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.020501256
"Activation and Regulation of the Understudied Kinome Using MIB/MS Technology DESCRIPTION: A novel approach has been implemented to study the activation state of protein kinases ""en masse"". Our methods allow isolation and analysis of protein kinases from cell lines, tissues and tumors assayed in a single mass spectrometry run using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs). MIBs consist of mixtures of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized, linker adapted, kinase inhibitors. Kinase capture is reproducible and is a function of  affinity of kinases for the different immobilized inhibitors as well as the activation state of the  kinase. The inhibitors we have synthesized for linker conjugation to Sepharose beads are primarily type 1 inhibitors that preferentially bind activated states of protein kinases. Extensive  characterization of the MIBs has demonstrated they have a strong preference for binding the active state of kinases and inactive kinases bind poorly. Using a layered bead composition for MIB columns, we are able to capture and identify more than 275 kinases in a single mass spectrometry run. Based on RNA-seq analysis, MIBs are capturing at least 75-80% of the expressed kinome from cell lines, tumors or normal tissues. Importantly, we have captured and characterized up to 275 kinases with as little as 500 mg protein from cell and tissue lysates. This level of sensitivity is essential for kinome analysis when tissue is limiting. Thus, MIB/MS provides an unparalleled scalable biology- based high throughput technology to assay the activation state of the kinome including ""untargeted and understudied"" kinases. There simply are few or no reagents for many of the ""understudied"" kinases, thereby limiting their study and MIB/MS overcomes these limitations. MIB/MS also detects activity changes in kinases for which reagents cannot distinguish closely related kinases (e.g., different activity states of MEK1 vs. MEK2 and ERK1 vs. ERK2, which are assessed together by anti-phospho-antibodies that cannot distinguish isoforms). Similarly, we can easily distinguish the regulation of related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as DDR1 and DDR2, for which there are few reagents for study. The aims will define comprehensive kinome activation signatures that include poorly or uncharacterized kinases. Aims include: 1. Determine the activation state of the kinome using MIB/MS for a series of human cell lines spanning different cancer types, human and mouse tumors, and normal tissues of the mouse. 2. Determine the response of the kinome to perturbation of cellular physiology using specific chemical probes targeting protein and lipid kinases, cytoskeleton, metabolic regulators, DNA damage and epigenetic chromatin modifying enzymes. 3. Determine the consequence of RNAi knockdown of understudied kinases on the activation state of the kinome. The aims emphasize determining the activation state of understudied kinases and if specific understudied kinases function as part of a signature of kinase activation/inhibition in response to specific cellular perturbations. This analysis will defne the signaling networks and cellular functions for which the activity of understudied kinases are regulated and contribute to homeostatic control mechanisms. The goal is to identify and validate which current understudied kinases function as regulatory nodes within the kinome and warrant future chemical probe development.

"Activation and Regulation of the Understudied Kinome Using MIB/MS Technology DESCRIPTION: A novel approach has been implemented to study the activation state of protein kinases ""en masse"". Our methods allow isolation and analysis of protein kinases from cell lines, tissues and tumors assayed in a single mass spectrometry run using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs). MIBs consist of mixtures of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized, linker adapted, kinase inhibitors. Kinase capture is reproducible and is a function of  affinity of kinases for the different immobilized inhibitors as well as the activation state of the  kinase. The inhibitors we have synthesized for linker conjugation to Sepharose beads are primarily type 1 inhibitors that preferentially bind activated states of protein kinases. Extensive  characterization of the MIBs has demonstrated they have a strong preference for binding the active state of kinases and inactive kinases bind poorly. Using a layered bead composition for MIB columns, we are able to capture and identify more than 275 kinases in a single mass spectrometry run. Based on RNA-seq analysis, MIBs are capturing at least 75-80% of the expressed kinome from cell lines, tumors or normal tissues. Importantly, we have captured and characterized up to 275 kinases with as little as 500 mg protein from cell and tissue lysates. This level of sensitivity is essential for kinome analysis when tissue is limiting. Thus, MIB/MS provides an unparalleled scalable biology- based high throughput technology to assay the activation state of the kinome including ""untargeted and understudied"" kinases. There simply are few or no reagents for many of the ""understudied"" kinases, thereby limiting their study and MIB/MS overcomes these limitations. MIB/MS also detects activity changes in kinases for which reagents cannot distinguish closely related kinases (e.g., different activity states of MEK1 vs. MEK2 and ERK1 vs. ERK2, which are assessed together by anti-phospho-antibodies that cannot distinguish isoforms). Similarly, we can easily distinguish the regulation of related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as DDR1 and DDR2, for which there are few reagents for study. The aims will define comprehensive kinome activation signatures that include poorly or uncharacterized kinases. Aims include: 1. Determine the activation state of the kinome using MIB/MS for a series of human cell lines spanning different cancer types, human and mouse tumors, and normal tissues of the mouse. 2. Determine the response of the kinome to perturbation of cellular physiology using specific chemical probes targeting protein and lipid kinases, cytoskeleton, metabolic regulators, DNA damage and epigenetic chromatin modifying enzymes. 3. Determine the consequence of RNAi knockdown of understudied kinases on the activation state of the kinome. The aims emphasize determining the activation state of understudied kinases and if specific understudied kinases function as part of a signature of kinase activation/inhibition in response to specific cellular perturbations. This analysis will defne the signaling networks and cellular functions for which the activity of understudied kinases are regulated and contribute to homeostatic control mechanisms. The goal is to identify and validate which current understudied kinases function as regulatory nodes within the kinome and warrant future chemical probe development.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,0.017740133

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets).

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative.

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques. Modern data science tools will reduce the barriers to high-throughput screening and make screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible.",A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening,10049862,R01GM135631,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Budgets', 'Chemicals', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protac', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening Result', 'Seeds', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'body system', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead optimization', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'prevent', 'protein degradation', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'technology development', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual library', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",R01,2020,475021,0.002449452
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,-0.006824852
"Support for Preparation of National Toxicology (NTP) Nomination Background Inform The goal of this contract is to provide support of National Toxicology Program (NTP) hazard identification activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents. To carry out its mission to evaluate environmental substances of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology, the NTP organizes and conducts a comprehensive research and testing program focused on determining potential human health hazards of exposures to chemical, biological or physical substances or mixtures of substances. The nomination and selection of substances for study by the NTP is critical to the effective long-term operation of the program and helps to ensure that NTP resources are being used to address priority public health needs. Within the NIEHS, the NTP Office of Nomination and Selection serves as the focal point for coordinating the nomination and selection process and providing supporting documentation for the evaluation and selection of substances nominated for study. This contract provides administrative and scientific support for the preparation of information materials and background documents on substances or issues under consideration for toxicological study by the NTP. Substances evaluated by the NTP include chemical, physical and biological agents to which humans are likely to be exposed and for which there is inadequate toxicity information to accurately estimate potential human health hazards and risks. The contractor utilizes public and proprietary databases and other information sources to comprehensively search and identify the existing information on substances under consideration. The data and information gathered in the literature searches are used to prepare brief summaries of the literature identified and a written review document (Toxicological Summary Report) containing information on physical and chemical properties, production levels and processes, uses, human exposure, regulatory status, human and environmental health effects, experimental toxicology studies, and structure-activity relationships. These reports are used in the formal open public process for the review and selection of substances for study by the NTP and for the design of NTP toxicology studies. Specifically, the reports are provided as supporting documents to each committee in the nomination review process (Interagency Committee for Chemical Evaluation and Coordination [ICCEC], NTP Board of Scientific Counselors, and the NTP Executive Committee). The supporting documents are made publicly available via the NTP web site during the nomination review process (e.g. see http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/34146) and are subsequently maintained on the NTP web site as nomination background information (e.g. see http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/18546). The information and documents developed though this contract, along with the data generated by the various NTP research and testing programs, are also used in the preparation of NTP Technical Reports.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,-0.01430401
"Screening method to identify environmental endocrine disruptors mediated by PPARs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 80,000 chemicals are in use in the United States and over 2,000 new ones are introduced annually (NRC, 1984; OTA, 1995). While relatively few of these chemicals are likely to pose a significant risk to human health or the environment, the effects of most of them are unknown. Of particular concern, particularly in children, are those that may affect the endocrine system. The potential health significance of endocrine disruptors that act through peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors (PPARs) is receiving more attention. Many of these are found at significant levels in infants and children and have the potential of influencing metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases and cardiovascular disease. In vitro screening tests to identify PPAR agonists currently available measure receptor binding or whole genome expression. These assays are clearly informative but the former provides no information on biological activities and the latter lacks specificity and can be difficult to translate to human health effects, having limied portability of the required technology to clinical studies and requiring intensive statistical analyses. Furthermore, PPAR responses are complex and difficult to interpret in terms of causality. PPAR-dependent responses are not only extremely diverse, but occur in both a species- and tissue-specific manner. The response can be influenced by the agonist concentration and combinations thereof as well as specific binding affinities. Given these current limitations, we propose to establish a high throughput in vitro cell culture screening assay to identify gene expression changes in key biological pathways that occur from putative environmental PPAR agonists using a low-density focused array card and selected human cell lines including HepaRG and THP1 cells, (hepatocyte and monocytes cell lines, respectively). Previous published studies and preliminary data provided here suggests that these cell lines respond to activation by PPAR agonists, reflect the biological responses that occur following human exposures and provide sufficient sensitivity indicating a high likelihood for success. The focus of this hypothesis-driven testing scheme is to identify agonists that can potentially produce health effects related to metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Results from these studies will help identify endocrine disruptors that have the potential to affect human health through their ability to serve as PPAR agonists. It can also be used to identify specific and potent candidate therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. population is exposed to a number of environmental chemicals termed endocrine disruptors that may be associated with the increasing incidence of metabolic disorders and obesity, particularly in children. A number of these chemicals are believed to act as PPAR agonists and affect homeostatic pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses.

"Integration of Metabolomics in Neuroimaging:Software for Brain NMR Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NMR spectroscopy is the most promising non-invasive method for assessing the biochemical state of the brain associated with different pathologies, including neurodegenerative and psychological disorders, cancer, inborn errors of metabolism, as well as for understanding the role of metabolites in the working brain. Incorporating metabolic information with the other modalities of neuro-imaging, however, is quite challenging. Chemical Shift Imaging acquires localized spectra in the brain in volumes as small as 0.4 cc, resulting in datasets containing hundreds of spectra. The goal of this grant application is to enhance software tool, 3D interactive Chemical Shift Imaging (3DiCSI), for comprehensive application to neuro-imaging data analysis. 3DiCSI combines data visualization, spectral processing, spectral localization and estimation, and spectral quantification together with spectral pattern recognition techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis and constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization. The proposed developments will improve the automatic importation of raw data by including file formats from all scanner brands as well as interface spectroscopy data with other neuro-imaging software tools. The standardization of data exportation and providing multi- platform support for the program will promote the data-sharing in the community and allow for dynamic collection of spectral data for creation of annotated database of brain metabolic patterns. The ability for a user to extend the functionality of the program will render 3DiCSI as a research platform providing data visualization, preprocessing and multivariate analysis which can be used to enhance an individual researcher's analytical procedures. Parallelization of the data processing routines and extending the spectral pattern discovery procedures will allow for real time identification and interpretation of aberrant spectral signature, related to type and state of disease, particularly important for the clinical application of 3DiCSI. Generation of comprehensive report summarizing the spectroscopy exam will be also essential for communicating the results. Support for automatic online program update download and improved documentation will ensure utilization of the program to its greatest potential. These developments will greatly improve the interoperability, adoptability and usability of 3DiCSI and facilitate the utilization of spectroscopy in neuro-imaging applications.     n/a",Integration of Metabolomics in Neuroimaging:Software for Brain NMR Spectroscopy,7364077,R03EB008203,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Individual', 'Invasive', 'Learning', 'Linux', 'Localized', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Numbers', 'Operating System', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'file format', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'metabolomics', 'neuroimaging', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,149058,-0.035154612
"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gene Expression', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histidine', 'Human', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cost', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,-0.040854074
