"DNA PATTERN IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS We will continue our development of methods for recognizing and                  representing functional domains in biological sequences.  This                   includes methods to identify regulatory sites in DNA starting                    from unaligned sequences, and to develop models that will allow                  new sites to be accurately predicted.  This will involve the                     adoption of better statistical models so that the most                           significant alignments can be more readily obtained.  We will                    also develop improved methods for recognizing functional motifs                  in RNA sequences that are composed of both sequence and                          structure.  These methods will be useful for identifying                         regulatory domains that operate post-transcriptionally, and also                 for determining the common motifs in RNAs selected in vitro for                  particular activities.  And we will further enhance methods for                  representing conserved domains in protein families that new                      members of the families can be identified more reliably.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2020,550000,0.06703078038424383

"Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic 09-MD- 102 Trans-disciplinary Research to Integrate the Biological and Non-biological Determinants of Health to Address Health Disparities. Description ""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors- specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction. Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six. Findings of this research will support clinical trials of risk-based caries management in vulnerable minority child populations and is adaptable to management of other chronic diseases in young children.

""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors-specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction.

"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.  (5) We will develop and             characterize unified methods for the simultaneous construction of alignments         and phylogenies over multiple sequences.  We will also develop standalone            tree-based alignment heuristics capable of rapidly aligning large numbers of         sequences.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES,6746918,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2004,364198,0.0732898926297042

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.

"OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system.

We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results                ",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,8968014,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'implementation research', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'systems research', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2015,899776,0.05419815627727861
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,0.0913258593623165

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB.

"Dfam: sustainable growth, curation support, and improved quality for mobile element annotation Project Summary / Abstract Repetitive DNA, especially that due to transposable elements (TEs), makes up a large fraction of many genomes. Thorough and accurate annotation of repetitive content in genomes depends on a comprehensive database of known TEs, along with robust statistical and procedural methods for recognizing decayed instances of elements and disentangling their complex relationships.  Annotation of TE instances is usually performed using our RepeatMasker software, which compares a genome to a database containing representations of known repeat families. These have historically been consensus sequences, which generally approximate the sequences of the original TEs. The largest repository of such consensus sequences is Repbase, whose restrictive license and limited interface for curators has led to a lack of input from third parties and the creation of many unaffiliated, often organism-specific open databases. The parallel existence of these many databases has led to a divergence in nomenclature and repeat definition.  Our Dfam database is an open access collection of repetitive DNA families, in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment and a profile hidden Markov model (HMM). We have demonstrated that profile HMMs support improved annotation sensitivity, and Dfam provides numerous aids to both curators of TE families and those who make use of the resulting annotations. In this proposal, we describe a plan to develop the infrastructure of Dfam to expand to 1000s of genomes, and to establish a self-sustaining TE Data Commons dependent on limited centralized curation. We further describe plans to improve the quality of repeat annotation through development of methods for more reliable alignment adjudication, to expand approaches to visualization of this complex data type, and to improve the modeling of TE subfamilies.  By further developing this open access database, we will provide a strong disincentive for the proliferation of unaffiliated non-standard repeat datasets and ease the burden of data management for those developing TE libraries. Project Narrative Most of the vertebrate genome finds its ultimate origin in transposable elements (TEs), and the thorough annotation of TEs is a critical aspect of genome annotation pipelines. Currently, the data used for this annotation is dominated by a single database, Repbase, whose restrictive license impedes coalescence on a central standardized resource. We have developed an innovative open access database (Dfam) that yields substantial gains in TE annotation quality and provides numerous novel features in support of community TE curation. We will grow and improve Dfam to create a sustainable, standardized, and open system for TE family data. To achieve this, we will develop Dfam's infrastructure to scale to 1000s of genomes, develop improved methods for computing and representing the complex relationships between TE instances, and develop a framework for aiding curators in developing and sharing their TE libraries.","Dfam: sustainable growth, curation support, and improved quality for mobile element annotation",9930626,U24HG010136,"['Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Biological databases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Commons', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disincentive', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'complex data ', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'vertebrate genome', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,U24,2020,607378,0.02512413719009641

"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,10003373,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness testing', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2020,540906,0.02246361815633046

Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,9815293,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2019,556256,0.02246361815633046

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,9988603,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2020,1338768,-0.0028067921551345703
"Effects of Lead on Calcium-Binding Proteins in Rats    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major long-term objectives of the proposed research are [1] to test the hypothesis that lead interacts with calcium binding proteins of the C2 and annexin families, and [2] to identify genes and proteins of these calcium-binding families that are regulated following lead exposure of rats. Lead poisoning remains a pervasive problem in the United States, affecting at least 5% of all children. The proposed research is intended to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying lead toxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated potent interactions between lead and proteins of the C2 domain family (e.g. protein kinase C and synaptotagmin) and annexins. Furthermore, lead exposure of cells has been shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding calcium-binding annexins. The four specific aims of this proposal are [1] to measure the interactions of lead with proteins of the C2 domain and annexin families, in order to determine the possible targets of lead. [2] To measure gene expression in the brain, kidney and liver of lead-exposed rats. This in vivo model may reveal whether lead exposure differentially regulates the expression of genes encoding calcium-binding proteins. [3] To extend gene expression studies to well characterized cell lines (astrocytes, PC12 cells, fibroblasts and normal rat kidney cells). These studies will complement gene expression measurements from the in vivo model. [4] To deposit gene expression data into a publicly accessible database. Together these studies may reveal which calcium binding proteins interact with lead, and which genes encoding calcium-binding proteins are regulated by lead exposure.         n/a",Effects of Lead on Calcium-Binding Proteins in Rats,7216675,R01ES012191,"['Affect', 'Annexin A1', 'Annexins', 'Astrocytes', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'C2 Domain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Binding', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Divalent Cations', 'Environmental Health', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Vitro', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Liver', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Molecular', 'Northern Blotting', 'PC12 Cells', 'Pattern', 'Phospholipase A2', 'Phospholipids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Proteins', 'Rat Cell Line', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'annexin A5', 'base', 'calreticulin', 'cell type', 'cellular targeting', 'frontal lobe', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'kidney cell', 'lead exposure', 'member', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotransmitter release', 'pup', 'repository', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'synaptotagmin']",NIEHS,HUGO W.

"A Genetic Study of GTS, OCD and ADHD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is a better understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors in human neuropsychiatric disorders through the study of the Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent research has led to several notable advances in our understanding of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. This research suggests that: 1) there are components of GTS, OCD and ADHD that represent distinct heritable phenotypes; 2) there are susceptibility genes of major effect that contribute to the expression of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions; 3) there are DMA markers in several genomic regions linked to susceptibility genes for each of these disorders; and 4) some of those genomic regions overlap, suggesting that some genes may be contributing to the susceptibility of shared components of each of these conditions. Furthermore, the prevalence of GTS, OCD, ADHD and associated illnesses and their debilitating affects on those afflicted makes these conditions a major public health problem. Understanding the genetic factors important for the manifestation of these conditions will be of direct benefit to patients concerned about recurrence in their families; ultimately, clarifying the genetics of these conditions may elucidate their pathogenesis and lead to more effective interventions. Results from our ongoing analyses suggest that there is an etiologic relationship between GTS, OCD and some types of ADHD. In this application, we are proposing to collect additional data that will make it possible to characterize more completely the nature of the relationship between GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. We propose to collect data from 700 families of ascertained individuals with GTS, OCD and ADHD. This data will allow a more complete delineation of the components of each disorder and allow a more complete examination of the genetic relationship between GTS, OCD and ADHD and their component parts. Data from these new family study samples should help identify specific genetic factors associated with the variable expression of GTS, OCD and ADHD and related behaviors.

"A Genetic Study of GTS, OCD and ADHD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is a better understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors in human neuropsychiatric disorders through the study of the Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent research has led to several notable advances in our understanding of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. This research suggests that: 1) there are components of GTS, OCD and ADHD that represent distinct heritable phenotypes; 2) there are susceptibility genes of major effect that contribute to the expression of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions; 3) there are DMA markers in several genomic regions linked to susceptibility genes for each of these disorders; and 4) some of those genomic regions overlap, suggesting that some genes may be contributing to the susceptibility of shared components of each of these conditions. Furthermore, the prevalence of GTS, OCD, ADHD and associated illnesses and their debilitating affects on those afflicted makes these conditions a major public health problem. Understanding the genetic factors important for the manifestation of these conditions will be of direct benefit to patients concerned about recurrence in their families; ultimately, clarifying the genetics of these conditions may elucidate their pathogenesis and lead to more effective interventions. Results from our ongoing analyses suggest that there is an etiologic relationship between GTS, OCD and some types of ADHD. In this application, we are proposing to collect additional data that will make it possible to characterize more completely the nature of the relationship between GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. We propose to collect data from 700 families of ascertained individuals with GTS, OCD and ADHD. This data will allow a more complete delineation of the components of each disorder and allow a more complete examination of the genetic relationship between GTS, OCD and ADHD and their component parts. Data from these new family study samples should help identify specific genetic factors associated with the variable expression of GTS, OCD and ADHD and related behaviors.

"The Neurotransmitter:  Sodium Symporter Permeation Pathway    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biogenic amine transporters play important roles in the action and recycling of their specific neuretransmitter substrates. They have been well established as the targets for many pharmacological agents that affect brain function. For examples, the rewarding properties of cocaine are due mainly to its inhibition of dopamine transporter (DAT); the antidepressant effect of imipramine is exerted on serotonin transporter (SERT). These transporters belong to the NeurotransmitterSodium Symporter (NSS) family, which has a large number of prokaryotic homologs, including a tryptophan transporter (TnaT), a tyrosine transporter (Tyt1), and a leucine transporter (LeuT). Recently, a LeuT structure has been solved in high resolution, with the substrate Leu bound in an enclosed cavity. However, the determinants of substrate specificity, an understanding of which is important for rational drug design, may lie not only within the binding site crevice revealed by the LeuT structure, but also along the permeation pathway. The long term goal of the present proposal is to elucidate dynamic structural changes of the permeation pathway of NSS family proteins during the translocation cycle and to evaluate competing transport models, e. g., the alternating-access scheme and the substrate hopping model. Specifically, using prokaryotic NSS-proteins, TnaT, Tyt1, and LeuT as model systems, this will be achieved by an integrated, comparative process of iteration between molecular modeling simulations and experimental investigations/validations. With this multidisciplinary protocol we will explore the conserved residue positions and potential auxiliary cavities that line the permeation pathway and reorganize dynamically in different conformational states. The common, and the different features of the permeation pathways, including the roles of sodium ions, will be compared among TnaT/Tyt1/LeuT, and with other prokaryotic and eukaryotic NSS-proteins. The knowledge acquired should shed light on the translocation cycles of biogenic amine transporters and will contribute to our understanding of the structural bases of substrate specificities.          n/a",The Neurotransmitter:  Sodium Symporter Permeation Pathway,7471635,K99DA023694,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Amphetamines', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cocaine', 'Data', 'Dental Cavity Lining', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Design', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Humulus', 'Imipramine', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Numbers', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Recycling', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Tyramine', 'Tyrosine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'extracellular', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular transporter', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurotransmission', 'noradrenaline transporter', 'novel', 'presynaptic', 'programs', 'protein transport', 'psychostimulant', 'receptor', 'research study', 'serotonin transporter', 'simulation', 'sodium ion', 'symporter', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2008,90000,0.0038427676281160396

"Families of cohort survivors over 90 - Study Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to recruit families of the long term survivors in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) for the Multicenter Study on Exceptional Survival in Families (ESF). The CHS cohort (n=5888) was originally recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in 4 US communities in 1989-90. They have been extremely well characterized regarding health and function, providing an opportunity to examine many specific as well as composite phenotypes over time. All have stored DNA or cryopreserved white blood cells. We have determined that about 400 individuals aged 90 and over will be available in CHS, with about 200 remaining free of disability and 100 with fairly large families (average 12) including sibs and their children. We would propose to characterize these family members at several levels of detail, to include the minimal data set suggested by the working group on exceptional survival. Since the disability measures proposed for the minimal data set may well not yet be expressed in the children, we also propose measures that would be   informative across a spectrum of age as markers of aging and subclinical disease processes. We have a long history of productive collaboration on large multicenter studies and can contribute to the design of common protocols and analytic approaches. Our goal is to contribute as a study center in the design and implementation of this study. We will recruit and examine older adults who have reached age 90, their siblings and the children of the index generation (index cases and siblings). We will determine the extent of clustering of several potential important exceptional survival phenotype. We can contribute data on environmental and behavioral determinants and intermediate phenotypes that can be assessed in younger old adults and will measure core phenotypic characteristics and important environmental exposures in these families. We will participate in the evaluation of aggregation of selected traits and combination of traits to inform future studies.

"Families of cohort survivors over 90 - Study Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to recruit families of the long term survivors in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) for the Multicenter Study on Exceptional Survival in Families (ESF). The CHS cohort (n=5888) was originally recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in 4 US communities in 1989-90. They have been extremely well characterized regarding health and function, providing an opportunity to examine many specific as well as composite phenotypes over time. All have stored DNA or cryopreserved white blood cells. We have determined that about 400 individuals aged 90 and over will be available in CHS, with about 200 remaining free of disability and 100 with fairly large families (average 12) including sibs and their children. We would propose to characterize these family members at several levels of detail, to include the minimal data set suggested by the working group on exceptional survival. Since the disability measures proposed for the minimal data set may well not yet be expressed in the children, we also propose measures that would be   informative across a spectrum of age as markers of aging and subclinical disease processes. We have a long history of productive collaboration on large multicenter studies and can contribute to the design of common protocols and analytic approaches. Our goal is to contribute as a study center in the design and implementation of this study. We will recruit and examine older adults who have reached age 90, their siblings and the children of the index generation (index cases and siblings). We will determine the extent of clustering of several potential important exceptional survival phenotype. We can contribute data on environmental and behavioral determinants and intermediate phenotypes that can be assessed in younger old adults and will measure core phenotypic characteristics and important environmental exposures in these families.

To accomplish this objective, the center and the three accompanying proposals, an ""Expert System for inferring patient illness and treatment models"", ""Self-regulation and self-management in older asthmatics,"" and ""Disease models, psychosocial factors and end-of-life planning"", have the following specific aims: 1. To deepen our understanding of cognitive and affective processes underlying older individuals' understanding and emotional reactions to their experiences with chronic illness, and the effects of their experience on function, treatment decisions, self care, social relationships and end of life decisions. The commonsense model of self regulation (CS/SR) will be used as the framework for integrating the individual, social, institutional and cultural level processes that reflect the inter-disciplinary make up of the center faculty. 2. To translate the findings of research based on cognitive/affective science into the clinical context by developing interventions that consider all participants in the management of chronic illness: practitioners, patients, and family members. We view this as a bidirectional process, the concepts for understanding cognitive-affective processes affecting practice, and practice raising questions and suggesting concepts for inclusion in the models of patient behavior. 3. Develop, test and disseminate theory based interventions to increase the overlap of common-sense models of illness and treatments (CS/SR) held by patients and family members with each other's representations and with valid biopsychosocial models of illness and treatment. A variety of methodologies are used by each study to achieve these aims including detailed observation of provider practices, cohort designs predicting patient behaviors and health outcomes, qualitative methods, and randomized trials assessing mediating processes and testing the efficacy of specific intervention strategies.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,0.05599944894923361

"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens,9557402,R43DA046238,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consumer Preferences', 'Cost Savings', 'Cultural Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Prevention Program', 'E-learning', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based program', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Family dynamics', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Speed', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral health intervention', 'child protection', 'child protective service', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'court', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'formative assessment', 'foster care', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interactive multimedia', 'mindfulness', 'preference', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'rehearsal', 'satisfaction', 'scaffold', 'service providers', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social learning', 'social media', 'social skills', 'software development', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,"STRENGTHENING FAMILIES PROGRAM, LLC",R43,2018,150054,0.1445518363961792
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,0.06407669899648077

By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9077885,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2015,846167,0.06407669899648077
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,0.1737839998049005
"THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEOSOME PATHWAY AND BMP-2 EXPRESSION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pharmacologic inhibition of the proteasome causes dramatic increases in bone formation in rodent bones in vitro and in vivo (Garrett.et al., 2003). Our preliminary data suggests that this effect is mediated (at least in major part) by increased expression of the bone growth regulatory factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Our recent Preliminary Data suggest that the Gli family of transcriptional regulators is responsible for the effects on BMP-2. It is the purpose of this application to (1) determine the molecular mechanisms by which inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway increases osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, (2) determine the role of increased BMP-2 expression in these effects in vivo, and (3) clarify the role of the Gli family of transcription factors in the increases in BMP-2 expression. Our most recent Preliminary Data suggest that in bone cells in vitro, Gli2 (and to a lesser extent, Gli1 and 3) stimulates BMP-2 transcription, while a truncated form of Gli3 produced in the proteasome is a powerful repressor (Gli2 is degraded completely by the proteasome, but Gli1 is not processed by the proteasome). Our hypothesis therefore is that BMP-2 transcription is normally regulated by Gli2 (which stimulates it) and truncated Gli3 (which opposes the stimulatory effects of Gli2). Proteasome inhibitors enhance accumulation of Gli2 and impair formation of truncated Gli3. These inhibitors thereby selectively stimulate BMP-2 transcription and bone formation primarily because of the effects of Gli2 on the BMP-2 promoter when unopposed by truncated Gli3. In this application, our goal is to test this hypothesis by a series of in vivo and in vitro biological experiments designed to determine the precise roles of these individual Gli family members on BMP-2 transcription and bone formation, as well as their relationship to proteasome inhibition. We also plan to characterize the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting Gli3 to the proteasome, namely (-TrCP, in bone formation by the use of transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of this enzyme. These experiments should clarify our understanding of the regulatory effects of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibition on bone formation, and identify important potential molecular targets for regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. n/a",THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEOSOME PATHWAY AND BMP-2 EXPRESSION,7455007,R01AR050605,"['26S proteasome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'BMP2 gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Bone Formation Stimulation', 'Bone Growth', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Resorption', 'COS-7 Cell', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Chemotaxis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enzymes', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Family member', 'GH1 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Marines', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Numbers', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Osteoporosis', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyubiquitination', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteasome Inhibition', 'Proteasome Inhibitor', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'Velcade', 'abstracting', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'bone cell', 'bone growth factor', 'bone morphogenetic protein 2', 'bone morphogenetic protein 4', 'concept', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'epoxomicin', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'mineralization', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'mutant', 'novel', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'smoothened signaling pathway', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'ubiquitin-protein ligase']",NIAMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,251037,0.04085393777981669

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials.             Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene,environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",7892091,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2010,154689,0.022085102878446526

These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene-  environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8288292,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2012,157939,0.022085102878446526
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis.

"Efficient Statistical Methods for Association Studies with Dense Genotypes and Family History of Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In many genetic studies, case-control samples (probands) are recruited and phenotypes in their relatives are collected through a family health history interview on the probands. In these designs with combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in probands and family history in relatives (GWAS+FH), family member’s dense genotypes are often not collected due to the high cost of in-person collection of blood sample or death of a relative. Discarding relatives’ phenotypes lead to waste of much useful information because by examining patterns of the phenotypes among relatives with combination of genetic factors, environmental conditions, and lifestyle choices, a GWAS+FH leads to improved power of identifying an individual at risk of disease than using probands data alone. Multilevel models are powerful tools to test for association between genetic markers and correlated phenotypes because of their ability to account for varying degrees of relatedness among individuals. Improved power is expected from increased sample size by including relatives, higher chance to detect genuine genetic associations, and better type I error control compared to probands only analyses. However, analysis is highly challenging due to missing genotypes in relatives and correlation among family members’ phenotypes. The use of mixed effects multilevel model tools is rare in genetic association studies until recently, mainly due to the bottleneck of sub-optimal computational tools that do not meet requirements to handle large-scale GWAS and large sample size. This proposal addresses these challenges by providing fast and comprehensive statistical tools to increase our ability to map genetic variants in the combined data of proband GWAS and family history in relatives. Through multilevel mixed effects models, we will achieve improved power of association testing while controlling for correlation and confounding by: (1) use dense genotypes in probands to estimate between-family genetic similarities and expected values of missing relative genotypes; and (2) combine with within-family relatedness represented by polygenic effects. We will apply our methods to analyze Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, which offers golden opportunities to discover genetic variants associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in multiple ethnicity groups (Caucasian, African American and Hispanics). The novel statistical methods will ultimately allow personalized risk estimation of disease to each individual’s unique biomarkers, and aid in important decision making including genetic testing and genetic counseling. PROJECT NARRATIVE Efficient statistical methods to estimate genotype-specific risk prediction in disease and analyze association of genetic risk variants with disease will directly impact the lives of individuals and families by providing prognostic information for subjects in relation to disease risk or onset.

"METHODS FOR FUNCTIONAL/COMPARATIVE GENOMICS The long-term research goal of my laboratory is to develop computational methods that can be extremely cost-effective in their ability to make functional predictions from DNA sequences, and to explore patterns of genomic evolution (comparative genomics).  In this proposal we plan to develop a statistical framework for modeling the alteration of evolutionary rate and substitution pattern during a certain period of evolutionary time (the rate-pattern change).  Our objective is to provide a statistically sound methodology for identifying amino acid residues that are responsible for functional divergence among homologous genes of a gene family, based on an auxiliary principle (working-hypothesis) that there is an intrinsic connection between evolutionary rate-pattern change and structural/functional change of a protein family.  These newly- developed methods may have great potential for biomedical and pharmaceutical research in the era of functional genomics.  Our specific aims are (1) develop a novel stochastic model for gene family evolution with special reference to evolutionary rate- pattern change after gene duplication, and implement an efficient maximum likelihood algorithm for sequence analysis; (2) develop the framework of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for predicting amino acid residues that have experienced rate-pattern changes among homologous genes of a gene family; (3) extend these methods such that they can be utilized with complicated cases such as a huge gene family; and (4) Test the relationship between sequence- diversity and function/structural diversity (the auxiliary principle) by using protein families for which related biological information is available, e.g., whether those residues important for functional divergence that have been verified by site- mutagenesis always receive high HMM scores.

Our specific aims are (1) develop a novel stochastic model for gene family evolution with special reference to evolutionary rate- pattern change after gene duplication, and implement an efficient maximum likelihood algorithm for sequence analysis; (2) develop the framework of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for predicting amino acid residues that have experienced rate-pattern changes among homologous genes of a gene family; (3) extend these methods such that they can be utilized with complicated cases such as a huge gene family; and (4) Test the relationship between sequence- diversity and function/structural diversity (the auxiliary principle) by using protein families for which related biological information is available, e.g., whether those residues important for functional divergence that have been verified by site- mutagenesis always receive high HMM scores.  Our methods may have many applications from understanding the 3D structure basis of functional divergence, predicting critical residues, to exploring the pattern of functional divergence among homologous genes at the genome level.  n/a",METHODS FOR FUNCTIONAL/COMPARATIVE GENOMICS,6196286,R01GM062118,"['biochemical evolution', ' cysteine endopeptidases', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic models', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' muscle proteins', ' protein structure']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,144500,0.20366399670323285
"CHANGING TEEN BEHAVIORS--CERVICAL CANCER PREVENTION The Family Planning Council of Southeastern Pennsylvania, in collaboration       with the Cancer Prevention Research Center of the University of Rhode            Island, is proposing an innovative study designed to address the risk            behaviors associated with a recent alarming increase in the incidence of         cervical neoplasias among young women. The proposed study is designed to         develop, implement and evaluate interventions that increase consistent           condom use and decrease cigarette smoking among 1,800 low income female          youth aged 14-17 years who obtain family planning services at four diverse       federally-funded family planning clinics. Smoking and unprotected sexual         intercourse have been found to be independently associated with increased        risks of cervical cancer in this population The proposed intervention is         based on the Transtheoretical or Stages of Change model combined with one        of the most promising modalities for reaching youth, an interactive              computer based expert system whose efficacy will be evaluated alone and in       combination with an adaptation of the anticipatory counseling model. Data        will be collected at four points during a nine-month intervention period         and at six-month intervals for 18 months post.intervention to assess             effects over time. In addition, the intervention is aimed at increasing          utilization of comprehensive, gynecologic health care including routine          Pap smear screening, follow.up colposcopic examination and treatment of          cervical dysplasia, the precursor of cervical cancers, when indicated.

"HLA and KIR Genomics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The two common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing, remitting conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Association studies have identified a number of susceptibility genes for both diseases, implicating both adaptive and innate immunity in response to intestinal microbes and, for CD, the autophagy pathway in disease susceptibility. As with virtually all autoimmune and inflammatory disease, allelic variation at the HLA class I and class II loci has been associated with both UC and CD. Based on our previous work, the association of specific HLA haplotypes (eg. DRB1*0103-DQB1*0301) is particularly strong and, based on our recent GWAS, the strongest SNP association is with particular clinical subtypes (eg. medically refractory UC). The contribution of the natural killer cells (NK) in innate immunity to the risk of IBD has not been as well examined. NK cells are controlled by several gene families that encode cell surface receptors. The stimulatory and/or inhibitory KIR receptors use polymorphic epitopes on HLA class I as their cognate ligands. In a recent study of CD, we found inhibitory KIR heterozygotes (KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3) significantly associated with protection in the absence of their HLA ligand (CI), and predisposing in the presence of CI ligand homozygosity. We propose to expand this work by examining the role of HLA and KIR alleles, haplotypes and KIR gene-HLA ligand pairs with clinically well-defined CD and UC cohorts of Caucasian and Hispanic-Puerto Rican ancestry. We will use our newly developed Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing system for allelic HLA resolution, and will finish development and validation on our KIR (16 gene) 454 assays to sequence both gene complexes in our cohorts. Caucasian (1300 patients/550 controls and 100 family trios) and Puerto Rican (300 patients/200 controls) CD cohorts, and Caucasian (300 patients with medically refractory disease/550 controls) and Puerto Rican (200 patients/200 controls) UC cohorts will be examined. We will also develop bioinformatic tools to deal with the complex analysis of the highly polymorphic HLA and KIR genes, and make these data management and analysis tools available through NIAID's ImmPort in partnership with BISC.

We will use our newly developed Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing system for allelic HLA resolution, and will finish development and validation on our KIR (16 gene) 454 assays to sequence both gene complexes in our cohorts. Caucasian (1300 patients/550 controls and 100 family trios) and Puerto Rican (300 patients/200 controls) CD cohorts, and Caucasian (300 patients with medically refractory disease/550 controls) and Puerto Rican (200 patients/200 controls) UC cohorts will be examined. We will also develop bioinformatic tools to deal with the complex analysis of the highly polymorphic HLA and KIR genes, and make these data management and analysis tools available through NIAID's ImmPort in partnership with BISC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are serious and common inflammatory diseases, involving adaptive and innate immunity and requiring long term and expensive health care. A deeper understanding of the role of HLA and KIR polymorphism in these diseases and in specific clinical subtypes of UC and CD may prove clinically valuable in patient stratification for choice of therapy; patients whose genotype indicates a more severe and rapid disease course may benefit from more aggressive therapy.          n/a",HLA and KIR Genomics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7992669,U01AI067068,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Ashkenazim', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colectomy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dideoxy Chain Termination DNA Sequencing', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epitopes', 'Ethnic group', 'Exons', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-A gene', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heterozygote', 'Hispanics', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inherited', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Puerto Rican', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Software Tools', 'Stratification', 'Support Contracts', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Titanium', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'genome wide association study', 'human leukocyte antigen gene', 'improved', 'killer inhibitory receptor', 'method development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'proband', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,U01,2010,973852,0.034359997064097134
"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6656262,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2003,25481,0.020779212850611545

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age.

"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9712679,R01HD090014,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Cities', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federal Government', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Income', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Poverty', 'Privatization', 'Public Housing', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social Policies', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wages', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lower income families', 'next generation', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'social', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment services', 'volunteer', 'voucher', 'welfare', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,483010,0.07910842955820618

"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,0.10496687890681679
"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases. This research bridges the gap by developing and applying data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods on genomic scale to predict high-quality structures covering the dark proteome, thus accelerating drug discovery leading to improved human health.",Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales,10029150,R35GM138146,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Disease', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Play', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'training opportunity', 'web server']",NIGMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R35,2020,362119,0.07814130883440945
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins.
