"COMPUTER BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence         data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)          of all viruses and related genetic elements. Phylogenetic trees will             provide a framework for the mapping of cell and tissue tropism,                  pathogenicity and virulence, modes of transmission and geographical              distributions, and many other higher order characteristics of viruses.           The specific aims of proposed analytical studies are: i) determining             functionally equivalent networks and frequency of exchange among and             between retroid elements, and their potential cellular homologues,               including new studies on 300 retroviral env proteins; 2) inferring               functionally important regions of all proteins of paramyxo-, rhabdo- and         filoviruses, (with privileged access to new Ebola sequences), and Borna          Disease virus, (including potential BDV sequences from schizophrenic             patients); and 3) the analysis of the dUTPase gene, as a model system,           to address issues relevant to the structure, function and evolution of           duplicated sequences, and potential horizontal transfer among and between        host and viral genomes. The specific aims of the technical studies are:          i) evaluation of stochastic production model approaches for generation           of multiple alignments, detection of recombination, and calculation of           evolutionary distances; and 2) development and testing of new and                existing methods for historical reconstruction of functionally equivalent        networks.                                                                                                                                                         RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, or Ebola) are the major causative agents of human,        animal and plant viral diseases world wide. The heterogeneous nature of          RNA populations makes it difficult to develop effective, anti-viral              agents. The sequence database is now large enough to conduct comparative         studies on natural variants versus chemotherapeutically induced mutants          for several retroviral proteins. This model study will provide new               information on the nature of selected mutations which will be useful in          future anti-viral drug development.                                                                                                                               Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense            interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science.

Unfortunately most biologists are           unaware of these developments. Application of these methods to real data         remains unexplored. The proposed studies will go a long way in rectifying        this gap in technological utilization. These studies will continue to            define important evolutionary' relationships and events, provide                 biologically informative sequence relationships for bench-marking new            software, and contribute new information relevant to the structure and           function of viral proteins suggesting new directions in laboratory               experimentation.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications.

"A Unified Nanopore Platform for Direct Sequencing of Individual Full Length RNA Strands Bearing Modified Nucleotides ABSTRACT We propose to implement a unified platform for detecting RNA nucleotide modifications on contiguous full length RNA strands using nanopore direct RNA sequencing. In principle, this technology could be used for all classes of RNA molecules in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It is a logical technical advance for RNA sequencing because the current standard, sequencing-by-synthesis using Solexa technology requires conversion of native cellular RNA into short (~300 nt) cDNA amplicons. In so doing, nucleotide modifications are erased and the continuity of intact RNA strands is lost, thus precluding accurate quantification of RNA isoforms. Nanopore strand sequencing overcomes these limitations because the ~2 nanometer-long integral sensor touches and identifies each base along intact native RNA strands as they are driven through the pore by an applied voltage. Thus, end-to-end sequence analysis of a given RNA strand is achieved.

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics.

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,9912024,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2020,38613,0.2980501102632692
"RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments Project Summary While very substantial progress has been made over the last 10 or so years with regards to next generation sequencing (NGS) and third generation sequencing (TGS) of DNA, the development of novel and enabling tool sets for RNA sequencing has lagged significantly. During this project, we aim to make significant progress with regards to that gap by developing and validating an entirely new solid-state sequencing platform, developed specifically and ideally for direct RNA sequencing, including its structural complexities and nucleotide modifications, all with high accuracy. While there are over 100 known RNA nucleotide modifications, due to the lack of analytical characterization methods available, the exact roles of these modifications remain to be determined. The technology that will be developed during the project will be capable of elucidating the roles of these modifications, and revolutionizing our understanding and use of the transcriptome/epitranscriptome. Project Narrative A method/technology capable of directly (without transcription) sequencing RNA, with extremely high accuracy and the inherent ability to identify nucleotide modifications, has the potential to revolutionize the use of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome, radically change standard R&D practices, as well as enable revolutionary diagnostics and therapeutics. The entirely new direct RNA sequencing methodology/technology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitation with currently available NGS, TGS, and single-molecule sequencing (SMS) approaches, resulting in technology that is cost efficient, highly accurate, easy-to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and capable of producing highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing.",RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments,9961426,R43HG011070,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudouridine', 'RNA', 'RNA primers', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'nanopore', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2020,279999,0.17405676499722056
"Efficient Methods for Dimensionality Reduction ofSingle-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data Project Summary: Efficient Methods for Dimensionality Reduction of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a revolutionary technology enabling discoveries in human physiology and disease. The datasets generated from single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments are so large that they cannot be analyzed or visualized using traditional statistical methods until the datasets have been shrunk using a technique named “dimensionality reduction.” Almost every analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing begins using a technique named principal component analysis (PCA) to accomplish dimensionality reduction. However, single-cell RNA-sequencing presents unique challenges making PCA difficult. First, the size of these datasets is so large that computing PCA requires specialized hardware and multiple hours. Fast algorithms to approximate PCA have been shown to dramatically speed up this process, but have not proliferated in the single cell-RNA sequencing community, in part because no parallelized algorithm has been written in the R computing language. Second, PCA requires the researcher to decide the final desired size of the dataset. Choosing too small of a size results in discarding valuable biological insights, while choosing too large a size increases the noise. However, there is no consensus on how to pick the optimal size for single-cell RNA sequencing, and there is evidence that this size might be systematically underestimated. Lastly, PCA cannot be applied directly to the count-data measured in single cell RNA sequencing, so researchers must first apply a preprocessing technique to normalize it. The current standard in the field is to apply the log transform – however, several recent studies have shown that the log transform creates statistical biases in single-cell RNA sequencing. In this fellowship, specifically tailored, fast methods for performing PCA on single-cell RNA- sequencing data will be developed: 1a) A framework to rigorously measure the consequence of changing preprocessing parameters on the final results of several publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets to enable experimentation of PCA on single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 1b) An ultra-fast, parallelized implementation of randomized PCA allowing researchers using standard laptops to rapidly perform PCA on single cell RNA sequencing data. 2) A technique for rigorously choosing the final size when performing principal component analysis for single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. 3) A method for transforming single-cell RNA-sequencing data so that it becomes appropriately distributed enabling proper usage of PCA without incurring statistical biases. This fellowship also includes a detailed training plan with valuable learning experiences for the applicant’s development as a physician-scientist who can apply methods from high dimensional-statistics to solving biomedical problems. Project Narrative: Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a revolutionary technology enabling discoveries in human physiology and disease. The data sets collected by this technology are so large that they require specialized statistical techniques to analyze using cumbersome computing hardware – however, these techniques were designed for a different type of data and consequently they create systematic biases.

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning.

"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10033447,R01LM013437,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'International', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,347736,0.14378479162916424
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.  n/a",MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS,3152439,R01AM032154,"['adenylate kinase', ' artificial intelligence', ' chromatin', ' cyclic AMP', ' enzyme induction /repression', ' gel electrophoresis', ' genetic transcription', ' glucocorticoids', ' hepatocellular carcinoma', ' hormone regulation /control mechanism', ' insulin', ' messenger RNA', ' phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase', ' radiotracer', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NIADDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,1985,81525,0.09950276346842583

"CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT IN NMR One of the most important applications for 2- and higher dimensional NMR spectroscopy is the determination of accurate 3-dimensional structures of small proteins, nucleic acids, and other important biological molecules in solution.  this new application, based in large part on NOESY data, offers unique promise for structural understanding of complex biomolecular systems.  There are significant challenges however, particularly in the area of computational methods which encompass:  (1) optimal preparation of the multi-dimensional NMR data for utilization including quantitative aspects, (2) automation of spectral assignments, and (3) development of efficient computational approaches for calculation and refinement of 3-dimensional molecular structures.  The goal of this project offers an improved methodology to meet directly the first challenge and to assist meeting the second challenge:  optimization of spectral contrast and resolution enhancement for multi-dimensional NMR data and improvement of quantification for evaluation of molecular structures.  To achieve this goal, non-linear processing methodology based on maximum likelihood spectral reconstruction is combined with selected symmetrization and other mathematical and logical operations, to enhance 2D and 3D NMR spectral contrast, and significantly facilitate identification of all crosspeaks, with subsequent improved quantification for both isolated and overlapped spectral features.  this project will evaluate and extend spectral quantification using these methods, exploring whether the methodology increases the number of usable and quantifiable crosspeaks.  Preliminary investigations suggest that gains of 25-50% or more can be achieved, significantly improving subsequent molecular modeling steps.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons.

"Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Summary/Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of algorithms in supervised machine learning that are able to build classification or regression models on training data such that these models can be used to predict information not seen during model construction. RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to 2 previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Narrative: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 1 way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated.          n/a",Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction,7157547,R43GM079132,"['RNA interference', 'biotechnology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gene targeting', 'genetic mapping', 'mathematical model', 'messenger RNA', 'method development', 'molecular genetics', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'thermodynamics']",NIGMS,"INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2006,97773,0.1594831164348309
"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments.

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging).

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases. Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.",An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks,8776718,R00GM095713,"['Age', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Foxes', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic approach', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Phase', 'Polyadenylation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer studies', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'design', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mRNA Export', 'mRNA Stability', 'markov model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2015,249000,0.23857607189081104
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.

"Identification, Discovery, and Public Archiving of RNA Structural Motifs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The non-coding RNAs play many functional roles in biological processes, such as catalysis, gene expression regulation and RNA splicing. The various roles played by non-coding RNA are determined by their character- istic structure. RNA structural motifs are recurrent structural components in the non-coding RNAs. The RNA structural motifs have conserved structures, and therefore, have conserved biological or structural functions. For instance, the kink-turn motif is found in different kinds of non-coding RNAs and all of them are responsible for protein binding activities. The alternation of their structures will result in loss-of-function of the RNA structural motif, and in some cases severe diseases. For example, the destruction of kink-turn motif in small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) will prevent it from recruiting the L7Ae protein, and thus lead to Dyskeratosis congenita and Prader-Willi syndrome. Therefore, the study of RNA structural motif will help us to elucidate the mechanisms of many diseases and lead to the development of novel treatment strategies. Currently, the essential RNA struc- tural motif research includes the following problems: 1) identifying all occurrences of the given motif (search), 2), classifying known motif instances based on their structures and functionalities (classification), and 3) defin- ing novel RNA structural motif families (de novo discovery). In this proposal, we aim at devising a suite of computational methods to solve these three problems. First, we will develop a new computational search tool which will, in addition to 3D geometry, take into account base pairing (hydrogen bonding forces) and base stack- ing (magnetic and electrostatic forces) information. Most of the existing RNA structural motif search tools show limitations in detecting motif instances with flexible geometry. The inclusion of base pairing and base stacking will resolve this issue. Second, we will develop a novel clustering strategy to solve the classification and de novo discovery problems simultaneously. Existing clustering strategies adopt length-dependent structural alignment score (which indicates the structural similarity between two candidate motif instances) as the distance measure- ment, and apply hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify closely related motif clusters. We plan to include a statistical framework that can normalize the alignment score, and thus resolve this issue. In addition, instead of hierarchical clustering algorithm, we will adopt clique-finding algorithm in our clustering strategy, so as to make it applicable to large data sets. We will examine the resulting clusters and compare them with known motifs, and then suggest novel RNA structural motif families. With the achievement of these two goals, we propose to build a database for archiving motif instances identified by our new search tool. Finally, we will report potential novel RNA structural motif families and encourage experimental investigation of their functionalities. We expect that the proposed work will lead to better understanding of the RNA structural motifs, and significantly promote biomedical research.

"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9973236,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,194584,0.10878684142170884

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.        ","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9070289,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2016,377807,0.37794015181628715
"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10007230,R01MH123183,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Bioconductor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'differential expression', 'excitatory neuron', 'frontal lobe', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte precursor', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical learning', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web app']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,620747,0.21771341668096364
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases.

To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence.

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.3952411466998103
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing data will determine which of the candidates is a true microRNA by detecting the ~22-nucleotide mature product.",Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo.,10043005,R21GM138951,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Embryo', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Northern Blotting', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organism', 'Plant Viruses', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonuclease III', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Small RNA', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Repression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep sequencing', 'exhaustion', 'gene repression', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'support vector machine', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,248333,0.1596147110556276
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood.

"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project.

"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework.

Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants.

"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches. Thus, this project is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability.",Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer,10027689,R01CA251150,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Chicago', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA methylation', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin Cancer', 'Standardization', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'biomedical resource', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2020,565529,0.320689272576604
