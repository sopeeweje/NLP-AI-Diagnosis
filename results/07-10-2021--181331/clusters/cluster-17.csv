"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,10005582,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,188226,178185562,0.49838311057742846
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.          PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.                ",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,8508595,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Commit', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2013,155064,37921345,0.5102135305265876
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology.
