"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States. This proposal furthers public health interests by providing important training opportunities to an early- career clinical investigator interested in developing medication to treat alcohol use disorder.

"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",10183106,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'detection sensitivity', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,183708
"Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods Project Summary The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek “protected time” for a period of intensive research focus to enhance the Candidate’s career development and to conduct research on the comparative effectiveness of competing brief alcohol interventions and their mechanisms. The proposed research strategy represents an ongoing, NIAAA-supported independent research program (R01 AA019511: Estimating Comparative Effectiveness of Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults, received 3rd percentile score). This K02 extends the R01 by (1) including an additional 25 data sets of individual participant data from brief alcohol interventions conducted between 2013 and 2020, and (2) embracing machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art statistical methods to help identify mechanisms of behavior change and to integrate and synthesize them across heterogeneous studies. The proposed protected time will be critical to update and enrich my research program in this current, rapidly changing clinical research environment. With accumulating high-quality clinical data and real-world data in the context of emerging data science capabilities, there exist opportunities as well as challenges. I am well suited to tackle emerging challenges for unprecedented opportunities, given my work in statistical data integration and broad experience in alcohol research. I want to create a large database where one can simultaneously examine secular/cohort effects, intervention effects, and effect heterogeneity at the most granular data level by developing and using new tools. My career goal is to become “one of the major hubs,” connecting disparate networks of researchers into a large connected network, promoting fluid interactions. The synergy from the large, interdisciplinary network would be helpful toward creating a “value” proposition of Big Data – the sum of the knowledge and insights from the collaboration by investigators is greater than isolated pursuits by each. Toward this goal, career development activities will be to (1) train in computational machine learning algorithms and real-world large-dimensional data analysis to facilitate collaboration with addiction researchers and statisticians; (2) enhance my understanding of technology-assisted adaptive interventions and passively collected outcomes data; (3) update my knowledge in basic health sciences related to addiction; and (4) submit at least two publications and two grants per year using newly acquired knowledge and skills proposed under K02. I have identified six highly active, nationally acclaimed experts in their respective fields. I will have individual and group research meetings with all six collaborators (three new collaborators for this K02) to develop innovative projects. In addition, I will attend workshops and conferences for training, carry out online training, and have guided reading and discussion with collaborators. I will visit collaborators for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Improving big data capabilities for biomedical and clinical research has been one of the major strategic plans of the NIH, and I am motivated and prepared to help meet that critical mission. Project Narrative Through innovative, comparative effectiveness research, we can improve interventions and develop individualized intervention strategies, which will reduce the serious negative consequences associated with heavy drinking and enhance the lives of adolescents and young adults. The results of this study will have a significant impact for all major stakeholders, including adolescents and young adults in need of treatment and their families, trial developers/researchers, school administrators. More broadly, this research will strengthen research practice, enhance transparency, and maximize the benefits of data sharing.",Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods,10223741,K02AA028630,"['Administrator', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Medical Research', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'behavior change', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief motivational intervention', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'multiple data sources', 'personalized intervention', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'research and development', 'sex', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tool', 'underage drinking', 'underage drinking prevention', 'university student', 'uptake', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,K02,2021,134843
"Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA ABSTRACT Recovering from Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) following treatment is difficult, with 43-83% relapsing post- discharge. These chronically high rates arise, in part, because of a gap in our knowledge about the co-evolution of in the moment risk mechanisms associated with relapse among those recovering from AUD, including Craving, Negative Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol (CASA). These four factors co-evolve among important protective factors that buffer relapse risk (e.g., improved sober support and psychosocial function associated with post-treatment community AUD recovery programs), and context-based risk factors such as near-at-hand places where alcohol is available. The immediate goal of this project is to develop the means to assess and understand the impact of these environmental/contextual factors for recovering alcoholics, towards a longer term research objective of developing effective just-in-time interventions that mitigate the risk of relapse. In this project, we will leverage novel assessment methodologies via a responsive ecological momentary assessment (rEMA) system developed by our team. This app-based system allows researchers to incorporate geospatial, time- specific and event-specific criteria for enhanced monitoring of (and just-in-time delivery of interventions to) recovering patients in post-treatment settings. Consistent with PA-18-620 from NIAAA, this project aims to build foundational evidence and refine the data collection/analysis strategy needed to achieve our long term objective, via the following specific aims: Aim 1) Pilot the use of our rEMA platform to capture fine-grained longitudinal data on Craving, Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol among 60 recovering alcoholics across 30 days, to evaluate CASA construct validity within rEMA data and assess the extent and impact of data missingness; Aim 2) Test incentive modalities that will inform us regarding best practices that maximize adherence to the rEMA protocol; Aim 3) Develop analytic strategies based machine-learning models of rEMA data, to forecast imminent risk and quantify causal pathways among CASA variables. To accomplish these aims, we will recruit and enroll adults (n=60; 50% female) in non-hospitalized residential AUD treatments in the Central Plains. Using smartphone assessment with GPS monitoring technology, we will collect longitudinal behavioral and experiential data from each participant over 30 days. Analysis of these data will advance our understanding of co-evolving contextual/social-environmental factors that impact the success/failure of the recovery effort, while establishing foundational evidence from which time/event-specific smartphone-based just-in-time interventions may be developed. The final phase of the project includes the creation of an advisory and dissemination board composed of local and national-level stakeholders, AUD treatment practitioners and other researchers that will guide the development of such an intervention. Included in this group are the directors of two non-hospitalized residential substance treatment facilities that function as community partners for the project through all project stages. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a significant need for reliable fine-grained data on the physical, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of relapse and recovery among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders. This study will use cutting-edge responsive ecological momentary assessment software to track craving, affect, stress, alcohol access, and exposure to support/risk locations among a cohort of 60 individuals currently participating in a non-hospitalized residential housing program. This data collection and modeling effort will set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of relapse and recovery risk patterns experienced by those with an alcohol use disorder, while supporting future cost-effective programming of relapse prevention and intervention services.","Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA",10196353,R21AA029231,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Homelessness', 'Housing', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Facilities', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol outlet density', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'data access', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'distilled alcoholic beverage', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'service intervention', 'sobriety', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'stressor', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R21,2021,262406
"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Focused on bartenders and servers, an at risk population, we will use innovative and rigorous data science techniques over mobile and social media data to study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) empathy. We further use machine learning to improve language-based assessments of psychological states and predictive models for future drinking, ultimately performing one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking.",Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers,10171732,R01AA028032,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consent', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Employee', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Restaurants', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'alcohol availability', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'social', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAAA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,648572
"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,10092805,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2021,19560
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus.

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187466,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2021,1025354
"Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation Project Summary Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach, considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification, and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition. Project Narrative Alcohol-associated liver disease represents a growing public health burden, particularly among younger age groups, women, and ethnic minorities, and is now the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. This project will identify predictors of outcome and improve prognostication in severely ill patients with alcohol- associated liver disease. Identifying reliable non-invasive markers that characterize the distinct phenotypes of alcohol-associated liver disease will be crucial to advance our understanding of this liver disease, target interventions, and appropriately allocate resources including liver transplantation.",Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation,10191957,K23AA029197,"['Abstinence', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Apoptotic', 'Ascites', 'Award', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bilirubin', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Creatinine', 'Cytokeratin-18 Staining Method', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatitis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'age group', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'career development', 'chemokine', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disease registry', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fibrogenesis', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'genetic variant', 'hepatocyte injury', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lipidome', 'liver transplantation', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'sarcopenia', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'sociodemographic factors', 'transcriptome', 'translational study', 'urinary']",NIAAA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,10201416,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,509663
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,10169180,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diagnostic platform', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,344735
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10212186,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,584057
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,10125984,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,183179
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,10169172,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,428830
"Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease, the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol- induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking. Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming, expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and can be adapted for high-throughput platforms. We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high- throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high- throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair. We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal alcohol exposure is a key factor contributing to abnormal heart development and is associated with various cardiac anomalies with serious long-term complications in adulthood. This study aims to discover novel molecular mechanisms and potential therapies to control the detrimental effect of alcohol exposure on cellular and functional properties of heart cells using human stem cell model.",Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model,10209255,R01AA028527,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'CXCL12 gene', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Ethanol', 'Ethanol toxicity', 'Event', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Woman', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'appropriate dose', 'cardiogenesis', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxicity', 'effective therapy', 'heart cell', 'heart disease risk', 'heart function', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'injury and repair', 'interest', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'nuclear factor-erythroid 2', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem cell model', 'stem cells', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAAA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,351750
"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes.

"Open bar assay: A novel operant paradigm for examining motivated response and substance abuse in Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individual variation in alcohol preference and self-administration facilitates compulsive alcohol seeking behavior. However, the circuit identity and function underlying individual variability in alcohol self-administration behaviors is still not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to identify subtle behavioral features, fundamental circuitry principles and neurophysiological dynamics underlying alcohol preference in the tractable model system Drosophila melanogaster. Aim 1 will employ a computer vision and machine learning approach to identify subtle behaviors that relate to alcohol preference and alcohol avoidance. In this Aim I hypothesize that animals that express alcohol preference display enhanced seeking behavior, in particular in response to alcohol self- administration whereas lower alcohol preference will manifest through avoidance and reduced locomotion. Aim 2 will employ thermogenetic inactivation, using the GAL4/UAS system, of learning and memory brain circuits we believe play a direct role in encoding alcohol preference. In this Aim I hypothesize that inactivation of our identified learning and memory brain circuits will directly suppress the expression of alcohol preference in flies. Aim 3 will investigate how the neurophysiological dynamics of our identified circuit differs between alcohol preferers and abstainers. I hypothesize that, in my identified circuit, alcohol exposure will result in robust neurophysiological responses in alcohol-preferers and that we will observe the opposite in alcohol abstainers. This work will provide a framework for predicting general circuit principles for escalation of alcohol self- administration in more complex brains, which is in alignment with NIAAA’s mission to support behavioral research on the causes of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innate drug preference has a direct impact on reward- and addiction-related behaviors, and yet how innate drug preference manifests is not well characterized.

"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,10147835,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone based assessment', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,628338
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,10132950,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,500906
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,10124252,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426735
"Trans-omic Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and its Relation to Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol consumption is an important modifiable lifestyle risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Advances in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to measure and analyze a variety of ‘omics’, that is, DNA methylation (methylome), gene expression (transcriptome), protein (proteome) and metabolite (metabolome), in relation to alcohol consumption and CVD in a cost-efficient manner. In this grant proposal, we will test the hypothesis that alcohol consumption alters multiple molecular processes across different “omics” dimensions and these molecular intermediates mediate alcohol’s effects on CVD. To test this hypothesis, we will assemble a multidisciplinary team to test five Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will first identify alcohol-associated transcriptomic markers. We will then examine the associations of alcohol-associated transcriptomic markers with incident CVD (fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke), and test whether these transcriptomic markers mediate the effect of alcohol intake on incident CVD. We will construct polygenic risk scores to examine the potential causal relationships between alcohol intake, transcriptomic markers, and incident CVD. We will also conduct a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to further test and quantify the causal relationships. In Aims 2 and 3, we will identify alcohol-associated proteomic (Aim 2) and metabolomic (Aim 3) markers and will test the relationship between alcohol, omics markers and CVD using similar methods outlined in Aim 1. Many alcohol-associated DNA methylation markers have been identified by our prior study in >13,000 participants. Therefore, in Aim 4, we will examine the relations of alcohol-associated DNA methylation markers with incident CVD using similar methods outlined in Aim 1. In Aim 5, we will integrate alcohol-associated multi-omics markers to identify key pathways and multi-omics modules associated with alcohol intake and CVD. We will perform Random Forest analysis to identify additional alcohol-associated multi- omics markers. We will also perform network analyses to identify modules of alcohol-associated multi-omics markers. We will examine the relationships between these identified multi-omics markers with incident CVD, and will functionally annotate these markers using bioinformatics tools (e.g., ENCODE, GTEx, Human Metabolome Database, and UniProt). With the completion of this project, we will highlight the novel molecular targets for both alcohol-associated CVD risk prevention and treatment. In addition, we will generate a multi-omics biomarker database of alcohol intake with tailored software to facilitate the future investigations of alcohol’s relations with other non-communicable diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases.
