"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,10129428,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2021,206030
"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN. n/a",ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks,10332268,OT2TR003441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digestion', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Provider', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'arbitrary spin', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'capsule', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'database query', 'distributed data', 'innovation', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,1052712
"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX,10333468,OT2TR003428,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knowledge graph', 'middleware', 'prototype', 'tool']",NCATS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2021,897051
"A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and  Communication Design Project Description 1. Overview Research on the effects of conflicts of interest (COI) in biomedical science have long- established, significant causes for concern. For example, industry-funded trials are significantly more likely to return results that support patient use of tested drugs. As early as 2003, a JAMA study of 370 randomized controlled trials found that industry-sponsored studies were 5.3 times more likely to return results favorable to industry.[1] Subsequent research has corroborated these sponsorship effects.[2] Furthermore, funding relationships come in the form of advisory board positions, speaking fees, consulting fees, free lunches, prescription pads, and ink pens, and these smaller, financial relationships also have significant, undesirable effects on biomedical research, including an 8.4 factor increase in the likelihood of results favorable to industry.[3] The primary purpose of this project is to develop new metrics and mechanisms for the evaluation and communication of COI risks in the biomedical research enterprise. The research will use a network science approach to understand the circulation and accumulation of COI in biomedical decision systems. Network science offers an ideal framework for assessing influence within the biomedical research enterprise. The approach also moves beyond understandings of COI as about individual researchers or funders to encompass systemic risk and network-level effects. To advance the science of COI mitigation, this research will improve and enhance a machine-learning-based system that identifies and classifies COI across published disclosure statements. We will apply this system to COI disclosure statements representing the current state of biomedical research for 240 of the most commonly used prescription drug products and distill COI networks for each drug. The team will test candidate COI and COI-network metrics against drug safety data drawn from the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Events Reporting System. The results will inform the development of new recommendations for COI policies in biomedical research and recommendations for evidence-based disclosure practices. 2. Intellectual Merit 2.1 Significance Given the growing recognition of the problems of COI, many federal agencies, universities, professional medical associations, and biomedical journals have adopted policies to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of these relationships. However, despite the consensus that policy interventions are a necessary and appropriate response, policies are inconsistent.[4] In some cases, institutions have outright bans on any financial relationships with industry. In other cases, institutions have complex requirements for vetting each individual COI. The FDA, for example, assesses each potential advisory committee member COI for “directness” and “predictability.” So, if a potential advisory committee member owns stock in a company that is seeking a new drug approval, regulators can identify a direct and predictable COI (stock values may rise based on the regulatory decision). The most common COI intervention across institutions is some form 12 n/a","A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design",10202242,R01GM141476,"['Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Circulation', 'Committee Members', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evaluation', 'Fees', 'Funding', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ink', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'New Drug Approvals', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'base', 'design', 'drug testing', 'evidence based guidelines', 'financial relationship', 'improved', 'medication safety', 'response']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,215960
"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We will model cross-disciplinary collaboration by building upon an existing partnership between the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University and the Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, grounding the project in both computing and biomedical research practice.",Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25),10199482,R25GM141501,"['Academic Training', 'Attitude', 'Biomedical Research', 'Certification', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Peer Review', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer science', 'education pathway', 'education resources', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'literacy', 'novel', 'online course', 'outreach program', 'pedagogy', 'programs', 'science education', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'student training', 'success', 'user centered design']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R25,2021,85673
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10330627,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2021,332969
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform Project Summary/Abstract Abstract: The rapid evolution of the field of biophotonics has produced numerous emerging techniques for combatting diseases and addressing urgent human health challenges, offering safe, non-invasive, and portable light-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and attracting exponentially growing attention over the past decade. Rigorous, fast, versatile and publicly available computational tools have played pivotal roles in the success of these novel approaches, leading to breakthroughs in new instrumentation designs and extensive explorations of complex biological systems such as human brains. The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX, http://mcx.space) light transport simulation platform developed by our team has become one of the most widely disseminated biophotonics modeling platforms, known for its high accuracy, high speed and versatility, as attested to by its over 27,000 downloads and nearly 1,000 citations from a large (2,400+ registered users) world-wide user community. Over the past years, we have also been pushing the boundaries in cutting-edge Monte Carlo (MC) photon simulation algorithms by exploring modern GPU architectures, advanced anatomical modeling methods and systematic software optimizations. In this proposed project, we will build upon the strong momentum created in the initial funding period, and strive to further advance the state-of-the-art of GPU-accelerated MC light transport modeling with strong support from the world’s leading GPU manufacturers and experts, further expanding our platform to address a number of emerging challenges in biomedical optics applications. Specifically, we will further explore emerging GPU architecture and resources, such as ray- tracing cores, half- and mixed-precision hardware, and portable programming models, to further accelerate the MC modeling speed. We will also develop hybrid shape/mesh-based MC algorithms to dramatically advance the capability in simulating extremely complex yet realistic anatomical structures, such as porous tissues in the lung, dense vessel networks in the brain, and multi-scaled tissue domains. In parallel, we aim to make a break- through in applying deep-learning-based image denoising techniques to equivalently accelerate MC simulations by 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes, as suggested in our preliminary studies. In the continuation of this project, we strive to create a dynamic and community-engaging simulation environment by extending our software to allow users to create, share, browse, and reuse pre-configured simulations, avoiding redundant works in re-creating complex simulations and facilitating reproducible research. In addition, we will expand our well-received user training programs and widely disseminate our open-source tools via major Linux distributions and container images. At the end of this continued funding period, we will provide the community with a significantly accelerated, widely-available and well-supported biophotonics modeling platform that can handle multi-scaled tissue optical modeling ranging from microscopic to macroscopic domains. Project Narrative The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) light transport modeling platform has quadrupled its user community and paper citation numbers during the initial funding period. Building upon this strong momentum, we aim to further explore computational acceleration enabled by emerging GPU architectures and resources, and spearhead novel Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to address the emerging needs of a broad biophotonics research community. We also dedicate our efforts to the further dissemination, training and usability enhancement of our software, and provide timely support to our large (>2,400 registered users) and active (>300 mailing list subscribers) user community.",Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform,10228757,R01GM114365,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Biophotonics', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future Generations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Linux', 'Lung', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'complex biological systems', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'portability', 'rapid growth', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,349146

The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects.

"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bibliography', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'Caliber', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Delirium', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Expenditures', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Study Section', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'patient population', 'peer', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'senior faculty', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'support network', 'symposium', 'systematic review', 'webinar', 'working group']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools.

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health. Special attention will be paid to factors creating health disparities.",Carolina Population Center,10136647,P2CHD050924,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'China', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Home environment', 'Inequality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural experiment', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Research', 'Population Sciences', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Talents', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Training Programs', 'Tsunami', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adolescent health', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'data access', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'sociodemographic variables', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,P2C,2021,766127
"The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR Project Summary  The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets. Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily manual.  We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on community standards.  Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their work. Project Narrative Data that offer precise descriptions of data—metadata—are critical scientific resources that facilitate the discovery, reuse, and reproducibility of the data to which they refer. Our goal is to create methods and tools that improve the quality of scientific metadata hosted in public repositories, and thus enhance the discoverability and re-use of public biomedical datasets. Making data more accessible through scientifically rigorous metadata will accelerate the ability to make transformative data-driven biomedical discoveries using public data archives.",The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR,10093841,R01LM013498,"['Age', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Categories', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numerical value', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data archive', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'metadata standards', 'public repository', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'search engine', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334847
"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of the R01 (MH074457-14) which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). BrainMap is a neuroimaging research resource facilitating cognitive neuroscience and disease-biomarker discovery via coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). BrainMap provides its end-user community with: curated 3-D coordinate data and experimental metadata from peer-reviewed publications; extensively validated computational tools for CBMA; CBMA-derived tools for data interpretation (e.g., functional property and disease loadings by location) and data analysis (e.g., via CBMA-derived disease models); instructional materials and on-site and on-line venues for learning CBMA methods; and, on-going end-user support. At present, BrainMap.org hosts two coordinate-based databases: task-activation (TA DB) and voxel- based morphometry (VBM DB). A voxel-based physiology database (VBP DB) is in the planning and piloting phase. BrainMap maintains an integrated pipeline of cross-platform (Java) tools for data coding (Scribe), filtered retrieval (Sleuth), activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) CBMA (GingerALE), data visualization (Mango), and data interpretation (CBMA-derived Mango plugins). Multiple network-modeling approaches have been successfully applied to BrainMap data – independent components analysis (ICA), author-topic modeling (ATM), graph-theory modeling (GTM), structural equation modeling (SEM), connectivity-based parcellation (CBP), and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) – but none are yet optimized and “pipelined” for general use. Utilization of BrainMap resources is substantial: our software, data and meta-data have been used in >1,000 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, > 500 were published in the current funding cycle (2015- 2020). Four aims are proposed, to maintain and extend this high-impact research resource.  Aim 1. Voxel-based Physiology DataBase (VBP DB) with Analysis Exemplars. Aim 2. BrainMap Community Portal for Multivariate Modeling with Applications & Exemplars. Aim 3. Large-scale Parameter Estimations. Aim 4. BrainMap Pipeline Enhancements and Community Support. The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data.",Meta-analysis in human brain mapping,10157292,R01MH074457,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Brain Mapping', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational workshop', 'Equation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mango - dietary', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'case control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graph theory', 'hemodynamics', 'independent component analysis', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'morphometry', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'simulation', 'webinar']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2021,637306
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2021,575125
"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function Project summary Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Astronomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'data standards', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'imaging platform', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus', 'web portal']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerobiology and novel tools to assess infectiousness Tuberculosis (TB), the leading cause of death in people living with HIV, is the archetypal airborne disease, spread person-to-person through the inhalation of aerosolized bacilli. In endemic regions, most TB disease results from recently acquired infection with M. tuberculosis (Mtb), and studies support that a minority of individuals are responsible for most TB transmission events. Although focusing TB control interventions, such as TB preventive treatment (TPT), on contacts of these highly infectious individuals is cost-effective, tests that accurately determine the infectiousness of patients with TB are lacking. The overall objective of this proposal is to prevent TB-related morbidity and mortality among PLHIV by developing a novel cough-based diagnostic of TB infectiousness. We previously developed a research tool to measure Mtb cough aerosolization, the cough aerosol sampling system (CASS), that predicts TB infectiousness. Recently, we investigated cough frequency as a marker of TB infectiousness, identified unique TB-related cough signatures and developed a mobile privacy-preserving cough detection system. In the proposed study, we will enroll HIV-positive and HIV-negative Kenyan adults who are newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB to assess their level of TB infectiousness using CASS-measured aerosolized Mtb counts (the outcome). In Aim 1, we will investigate cough frequency and/or cough spectrogram (collectively “cough signature”) to estimate TB infectiousness and investigate the impact of HIV co-infection on TB infectiousness. In Aim 2, we will identify the household contacts of Aim 1 participants (index cases) to investigate for latent TB infection using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and determine whether index case cough signatures associated with high Mtb aerosol counts are associated with a greater frequency of positive IGRAs in household contacts. Additionally, at 6 months after enrollment we will re-test household contacts with IGRAs to understand if the durability of positive responses is associated with index case cough signatures. We hypothesize that individuals with high Mtb aerosol counts will have high cough frequencies and unique cough spectrograms, and that cough spectrograms will differ by HIV status despite similar Mtb aerosol counts. Furthermore, we hypothesize that household contacts to index cases with “highly infectious” cough signatures are more likely to have positive IGRAs at baseline and at 6-month follow- up. Our team has developed the tools to not only robustly determine infectiousness (CASS), but to evaluate both cough frequency and intensity (spectrogram analyses) in a high HIV/TB burden setting. By identifying cough signatures predictive of TB infectiousness, we will develop tools for clinicians and public health programs to support the targeting of TB control interventions. Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) stops infection with M. tuberculosis from progressing to tuberculosis disease and is key to the control of tuberculosis, the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. Identifying people who are spreading the most tuberculosis (i.e., most infectious) would enable the targeting of TPT and other interventions to control tuberculosis. The investigators will use aerobiology assessments of infectiousness to study whether cough signatures identify highly infectious individuals with TB and to investigate the effects of HIV infection on tuberculosis infectiousness.",Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerobiology and novel tools to assess infectiousness,10151102,UH2AI152621,"['Acid Fast Bacillae Staining Method', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Bacillus', 'Belief', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Immunocompetence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inhalation', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sputum', 'Study models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'co-infection', 'cost effective', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UH2,2021,205391
"National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Project summary/abstract NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington) has been active since 1999. The existing NACC infrastructure is described in the Facilities and Resources Section of this application. The broad goals of the past funding cycles are consistent with those of the current U24 RFA — that is, to serve as: a.) the central hub for organizing and enabling communication within and outside of the ADRC program, including annual meetings and steering committees; b.) a national data resource, collecting data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) as well as affiliated data and sample repositories; and c.) a facilitator of current and future AD/ADRD research. NACC has considerable experience and success in reaching these goals, and is positioned for continued success in a rapidly advancing field. New data and methods are appearing in areas such as biomarkers, neuropathology, and tests for early detection. Through the strategic adoption of technological advances, we will build on these accomplishments at an accelerated pace. Building on our already significant capabilities, we will: promote and broaden communication within and outside of the ADRC program; expand informatics capabilities of NACC consistent with FAIR principles; conduct and support methodologic and applied research, leveraging deep expertise in biostatistics and data science; and support early-career research scientists by providing peer-reviewed competitive funding for several “junior investigators” each year. We aim to continue to improve our approach in each arena by combining time-tested approaches with the new tools and innovations we are developing to meet the changing scientific, technological, and communication needs of the NIA ADRC program and the field. Narrative NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington — now seeking renewal as a U24) has been active since 1999, and has established a standardized, longitudinal clinical database of over 42,000 individuals (with neuropathology data on over 6,100), as well as cross-sectional, retrospective data on roughly 66,000 individuals seen at ADRCs between 1984 and 2005. NACC has made these data freely available to researchers worldwide, resulting in hundreds of publications. We will modernize and intensify our informatics approach, making data access and use more efficient; will grow communication and coordination capabilities with the ADRCs and collaborating NIA projects; will develop and apply big-data research tools for the field; and will provide competitive, peer-reviewed research support for several new investigators each year. Together with the field’s leaders, NACC will innovate, develop, and drive solutions to meet the changing needs of the field as well as the NIA ADRC program.",National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center,10204491,U24AG072122,"['Achievement', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Peer Review', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Peer Review', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'clinical database', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'community center', 'data access', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease heterogeneity', 'e-science', 'experience', 'high standard', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'programs', 'repository', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'translational health science', 'trend', 'web site']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U24,2021,6979612

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,10071093,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2021,623092
"Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals PhysioNet, established in 1999 as the NIH-sponsored Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, has attained a preeminent status among biomedical data and software resources. Its data archive was the first, and remains the world's largest, most comprehensive and widely used repository of time-varying physiologic signals. Its software collection supports exploration and quantitative analyses of its own and other databases by providing a wide range of well-documented, rigorously tested open-source programs that can be run on any platform. PhysioNet's team of researchers drive the creation and enrichment of: i) Data collections that provide comprehensive, multifaceted views of pathophysiology over long time intervals, such as the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Databases of critical care patients; ii) Analytic methods for quantification of information encoded in physiologic signals relevant to risk stratification and health status assessment; iii) User interfaces, reference materials and services that add value and improve access to the resource’s data and software; and iv) unique annual Challenges focusing on high priority clinical problems, such as early prediction of sepsis, detection and quantification of sleep apnea syndromes from a single lead electrocardiogram (ECG), false alarm detection in the intensive care unit (ICU), continuous fetal ECG monitoring, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation detection and prediction. PhysioNet is a proven enabler and accelerator of innovative research by investigators with a diverse range of interests, working on projects made possible by data that are otherwise inaccessible.

Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),10372242,P30GM122734,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Mission', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'New Mexico', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'distinguished professor', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'meetings', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,LOVELACE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2021,373857

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,10147861,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker signature', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1490544
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,10190807,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sample archive', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,191195
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342
"OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT OpenMM [http://openmm.org] is the most widely-used open source GPU-accelerated framework for biomolecular modeling and simulation (>1300 citations, >270,000 downloads, >1M deployed instances). Its Python API makes it widely popular as both an application (for modelers) and a library (for developers), while its C/C++/Fortran bindings enable major legacy simulation packages to use OpenMM to provide high performance on modern hardware. OpenMM has been used for probing biological questions that leverage the $14B global investment in structural data from the PDB at multiple scales, from detailed studies of single disease proteins to superfamily-wide modeling studies and large-scale drug development efforts in industry and academia. Originally developed with NIH funding by the Pande lab at Stanford, we aim to fully transition toward a community governance and sustainable development model and extend its capabilities to ensure OpenMM can power the next decade of biomolecular research. To fully exploit the revolution in QM-level accuracy with machine-learning (ML) potentials, we will add plug-in support for ML models augmented by GPU-accelerated kernels, enabling transformative science with QM-level accuracy. To enable high-productivity development of new ML models with training dataset sizes approaching 100 million molecules, we will develop a Python framework to enable OpenMM to be easily used within modern ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Together with continued optimizations to exploit inexpensive GPUs, these advances will power a transformation within biomolecular modeling and simulation, much as deep learning has transformed computer vision. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomolecular modeling and simulation is a key technology for leveraging the $14B global investment in biomolec- ular structure data in the protein databank to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying biology and disease and the development of new therapies. In this proposal, we aim to expand the development of OpenMM, a free and open source biomolecular modeling and simulation package that can exploit a wide range of consumer-grade and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable researchers and applications built on OpenMM to achieve high performance with extreme ﬂexibility. A key aspect of this proposal is to accelerate research in the emerging ﬁeld of biomolecular machine learning by tightly integrating OpenMM with modern ma- chine learning frameworks, enabling researchers to build, use, and deploy machine learning potentials, collective variables, and integrators to advance the state of biomolecular modeling.","OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning",10100573,R01GM140090,"['Academia', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Performance', 'Plug-in', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug development', 'enzyme mechanism', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'protein data bank', 'quantum', 'repository', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426294
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,10092079,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker signature', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,728879
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10330631,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2021,736476
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10269008,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617911
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'metadata standards', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275

The project will develop a uniﬁed SGT framework for big data analysis using machine learning including the treatment of time varying covariate survival analysis, unsupervised learning, highly imbalanced data and multivariate regression.

"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,10214625,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2021,3125
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,360227
"2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology The purpose of this proposal is to seek support for the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP), which will be held in conjunction with the Experimental Biology 2021 conference from May 1-4 using a virtual meeting platform. ASIP’s Annual Meeting provides a unique forum for presentation and sharing of cutting-edge research in experimental pathology. The target audience and subject matter for the meeting are diverse but united by a common focus on mechanisms of disease. The theme of the ASIP 2021 Annual Meeting is ‘From microbiota to artificial intelligence: emerging technologies and approaches for discovering mechanisms of pathobiology.’ Reflecting the interests of the ASIP membership, the 2021 Annual Meeting contains strong components in neoplasia and precision medicine. Major sessions will focus on the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer; hepatic tumorigenesis; epigenetic regulation in cancer; single-cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis; precision oncology; new technologies in precision medicine; and progress in the use of big data and artificial intelligence to understand mechanisms of disease. Application of insights gained from basic research to therapy and prevention will be a particular focus throughout the meeting. The four-day program comprises symposia, workshops, and lectures by award recipients, as well as abstract-driven minisymposia and poster sessions. The program further provides a number of educational initiatives, both targeted and of interest to the biomedical research community as a whole. These include sessions on diverse career paths in the biomedical sciences; preparation for the first faculty position; and creation of individual development plans. The ASIP regards promotion of the career development of trainee and young investigators as an extremely important aspect of the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the meeting provides not only special events designed for their needs but also sessions that showcase their work. Similarly, the Program Committee works hard to ensure diversity among the participants with respect to gender, ethnic/racial group, and stage of career. The sole specific aim of this application is to promote the participation of trainees in the 2021 Annual Meeting through provision of a trainee scholar award program targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and clinical residents and fellows in pathology. The Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology offers a unique forum for the sharing of original research results related to a wide spectrum of human diseases and disorders, with particular emphasis on the development, treatment, and prevention of cancer. Such sharing fosters more rapid advances in the understanding of human diseases such as cancer and accelerates the rate at which this knowledge can be applied to the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests, as well as targeted therapies. A major goal of the meeting is to provide educational and career support to young investigators who are interested in cancer biology and experimental pathobiology.",2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology,10231963,R13CA260876,"['American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational workshop', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Pathology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasms', 'Organoids', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Societies', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Societies', 'Special Event', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'breast cancer progression', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'design', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'member', 'microbiota', 'new technology', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic assays', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis', 'virtual']",NCI,AMERICAN SOCIETY/INVESTIGATIVE PATHOLOGY,R13,2021,12500
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,10133117,R00HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blockchain', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy preservation', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2021,249000
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209
"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs. We will accomplish this goal through six cores that function synergistically together: four Resource Cores with particular expertise in protein (Core C) and metabolite (Core D) phenotypes of aging, invertebrate longevity and healthspan phenotypes (Core E) and artificial intelligence and bioinformatics (Core F), along with a Research Development Core (Core B) that supports external pilot projects and junior faculty studies, and an Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) that supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, sponsorship and organization of national meetings and pre-meetings, courses, workshops and seminars, and, in coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, a Geropathology Research initiative.",Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10260476,P30AG013280,"['Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology of Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Gerontology', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell age', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach services', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P30,2021,962037
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10183329,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2021,797476
"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10143312,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2021,499966
"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Education', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Reports', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Molecular', 'National Research Council', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anxious', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'broadening participation research', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'price lists', 'protein folding', 'service providers', 'supercomputer', 'uptake', 'web portal']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform. Project Narrative We will compile existing TB gene expression data and develop a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. We will provide curated data for dozens of existing TB RNA-sequencing datasets, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly software toolkit and platform.",Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease.,10214482,R21AI154387,"['Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'comorbidity', 'computational platform', 'data harmonization', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'interactive tool', 'latent infection', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'multiple datasets', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,206823
"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,10077318,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2021,383279
"A High Performance Research Image Repository (RIR) for the Washington University Center of High Performance Computing (CHPC) Project Summary/Abstract: We propose to build a Research Image Repository (RIR) to house large collections of biomedical imaging data. The RIR will include datasets produced locally at Washington University: The Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) (which itself includes the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult study, The Lifespan related projects, the Disease related projects, and assorted HCP-related projects), The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, The Comprehensive Neuro-Oncology Data Repository (CONDR), and the clinically-based PACS image repository. In addition, copies of external data collections such as the UK Biobank, The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA) will be maintained. The RIR includes a data management software solution that will introduce many novel features (such as `data tagging' to enrich datasets, and advanced search features) and will allow us to leverage existing storage including the Center for High Performance Computing's (CHPC) 1.4PB of BeeGFS `scratch' storage, solid-state NVMe drives integrated into the compute nodes, and 10PB of ZFS-based storage. All storage will be presented to the user as a single file-system, while data will be migrated to different performance tiers based on the storage requirements of the datasets or processing algorithms. The RIR will be integrated into the CHPC for data processing. The proposal also includes two NVIDIA DGX A100 GPU servers providing state-of-the-art GPU- based processing power. The combination of high-quality, diverse sets of biomedical imaging data with next- generation computing power will have a transformative effect on biomedical imaging processing pipelines and nowhere will the effects be more profound than in the emerging field of Deep Learning for image processing.
