"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'provider factors', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10256796,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2021,3917810
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10162387,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,759049
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,10092219,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,33126
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,10112311,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,705172
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,10138024,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,249264
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,10164863,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2021,694636
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,10075321,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,816340
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,10133145,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,191000
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,10129768,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,377498
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,10089147,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,664089
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9841303,R01DC014498,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317844
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,10057390,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,748815
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis).

"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),10129429,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'design', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2021,1640084
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10227196,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data repository', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,774017
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk,10122994,R01MH120090,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,583239
