"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes. The results will complement the current knowledge base for individual patient care using evidence generated from patients in real-world clinical practices.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,10129392,R01GM124104,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Categories', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Formulation', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'adaptive learning', 'adverse event risk', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'complex data', 'data modeling', 'data space', 'design', 'evidence base', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'scale up', 'statistical learning', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,328697
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy PROJECT SUMMARY: Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged adults in the United States (US). Advanced diabetic retinopathy is referred to as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In many patients, blindness associated with PDR can be prevented with appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, some patients at high risk for PDR are not receiving adequate eye care. More knowledge is needed about PDR outcomes in a real-world setting, and the differences between published study outcomes and real-world effectiveness. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in nearly 90% of outpatient physician offices and can be a powerful tool for studying PDR in a real-world setting. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate EHR-based methods to improve outcomes in PDR. The study aims are: (1) to classify patients with PDR in the EHR system using an automated method that incorporates structured (e.g., diagnosis code, medications, labs) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes), (2) to predict the progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to PDR using a forecasting model with time-varying covariates, and (3) to determine the real-world effectiveness of treatments for PDR in a large nationwide eye dataset. The study will utilize data from the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) De-Identified Clinical Data Warehouse, a de-identified EHR with over 1 million patients that has available eye exam information, and the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry, a nationwide comprehensive eye database that includes data from over 15,000 eye providers in the US with over 1 million patients with PDR. The innovative methods and tools from this study can be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR- based clinical studies in ophthalmology. The candidate, Dr. Catherine Sun is an ophthalmologist whose long- term goal is to study real-world clinical outcomes in ophthalmology by conducting EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials and using large-scale EHR data. While she possesses the foundational skills, additional mentored training and coursework in data analytics, biomedical informatics, biostatistics, and advanced clinical trial design and implementation will help her reach her goals. Her outstanding mentorship team of primary mentor Dr. Nisha Acharya and co-mentors Dr. Travis Porco and Dr. Joshua Stein, and the exceptional environment of the Department of Ophthalmology and the F.I. Proctor Foundation at UCSF will support Dr. Sun’s development into an R01-funded independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) represents advanced diabetic eye disease and can result in permanent vision loss. The electronic health record (EHR) can be a powerful tool for studying real-world outcomes of conditions like PDR to help prevent disease occurrence and improve outcomes. We will develop and validate EHR-based methods and tools to improve outcomes in PDR, which can also be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR-based clinical studies in ophthalmology.",Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy,10191673,K23EY032637,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'comparison intervention', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'risk stratification', 'routine care', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'unstructured data']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,252236
"COVID-19 disease course analysis using multi-site large-scale EHR data Project Summary/Abstract  Since its ﬁrst case reported in December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pan- demic in 188 countries/regions, and has precipitated an unprecedented health, economic and social crisis. In order to cope with the volatile dynamic and severity of the pandemic, it is imperative that we characterize the various clinical courses of COVID-19 infection, and determine whether and how demographic, clinical and other variables inﬂuence them. Knowledge of the disease's transmission, symptomatology, clinical course, treatment and outcomes is rapidly evolving based on many sources. An important source for advancing this knowledge is data from electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE) because they can pro- vide a real-time, unvarnished view of the disease. Using large-scale, well-integrated and rich EHR data enables comprehensive proﬁling and quantiﬁcation of the COVID-19 disease course that can directly inform clinical prac- tice. The long-term goal of our research is to develop Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) tools to facilitate access to and analysis of clinical data. The goal of this application is to develop effective algorithms and tools to mine clinical data to categorize disease courses of COVID-19, and determine the effect of clinical and other variables asso- ciated with them. We will develop our algorithms using data from a large and comprehensive health information exchange, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), which has about 40,000 COVID-19 patients and fairly complete EHR data about them. We will evaluate the algorithms against other data sets, including EHR data from the OSU Wexner Medical Center and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The speciﬁc aims of this project are to (1) develop COVID-19 disease course groupings, (2) relate comorbidities and other clinical variables to the COVID-19 disease course, and (3) validate the developed algorithms on N3C data. This pro- posal is signiﬁcant because the methods developed in this project have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase our capability for computational analysis of large and rich patient data during the pandemic and beyond; the knowl- edge derived from our comprehensive proﬁling of COVID-19 courses over large, inclusive patient populations supported by rich EHR data can positively impact clinical practice; and the tools developed in this project will be released to the public as a free COVID-19 research re- source. It is innovative because our methods integrate novel methods such as patient clustering using clinical variables and disease progression trajectories, and pa- tient trajectory comparison, with established univariate and predictive analysis; our primary approach will lever- age the oldest and one of the country's largest HIEs to derive detailed and comprehensive knowledge about a large patient population; and the strong preliminary data generated by this project can help improve COVID-19 patient phenotyping, disease characterization and diagnosis.

"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,10149327,R21LM013937,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Store', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,186725
"PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally. However, a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping (i.e., correctly identifying individuals with a particular trait of interest). Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. However, each requires an extensive investment of time and resources to develop due to the heterogeneity, complexity, inaccuracy, and frequent fragmentation of EHRs. The lack of general, automatic, and portable approaches to enable accurate high- throughput phenotyping is a critical barrier that hampers our ability to leverage valuable clinical data in EHRs for better healthcare. We propose a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that we have developed from public resources and will further refine and implement across various EHRs. We recognize that mass information about phenotypes is often described in significant detail and continuedly accumulated within publicly available resources (e.g., MedlinePlus and Wikipedia). We hypothesize this information can be retrieved, filtered, organized, measured, and formalized into standard EHR phenotype profiles. Indeed, we have used such an ensemble approach to integrate four generalizable online medication resources (e.g., SIDER and RxNorm) to create MEDI--a resource linking 2,136 medications and 13,304 indications. In preliminary studies, we extended this strategy to phenotyping and created a prototype PheMAP. For each phenotype, we identified relevant clinical concepts and weighted each based on its importance to the phenotype. We then mapped all associated concepts to commonly-used clinical terminologies. Our preliminary studies showed an average consistency of 98.6%±0.8% between our early-stage PheMAP and three validated eMERGE algorithms (Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism). We seek support to refine and optimize PheMAP and develop tools to allow researchers to implement PheMAP efficiently in different EHRs. This will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention. Since PheMAP is created using independent resources that are more generalizable than a local clinical dataset, the implementation will generate more consistent outcomes in different EHRs for large-scale analyses.The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to conduct high-throughput genome-wide and phenome-wide association analyses (GWASs and PheWASs). We will use data from multiple biobanks to accomplish these tasks. Specifically, we will achieve the following goals in this grant: 1.refine PheMAP and conduct large-scale validation, 2. implement PheMAP and perform representative GWASs and PheWASs, 3. Use PheMAP to conduct GWASs for unstudied or understudied diseases and phenotypes, and 4. Share PheMAP to facilitate research using EHRs. Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally while a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping. Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. We propose to refine, validate, and share a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that allows researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention.","PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping",10095131,R01GM139891,"['Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'MedlinePlus', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Terminology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'implementation tool', 'interest', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'off-label use', 'phenome', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'prototype', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,432500
"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,10113626,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,397484
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,10160823,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,121288
"Personalized Predictions for Glaucoma Progression Using Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Health Records Project Summary/Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 60 million people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's success in becoming an independent clinician-investigator integrating ophthalmology and informatics. Project Narrative/Public Health Statement: This project is relevant to public health in focusing on developing and evaluating predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression, which are necessary to tailor treatment approaches to individual glaucoma patients' needs and achieve optimal treatment outcomes to prevent blindness. The powerful artificial intelligence techniques we will develop and use for large-scale data from electronic health records can be extended to include a wide variety of data sources and shared with the research and clinical community to answer ophthalmic questions in many domains.

"Developing and Evaluating a Machine-Learning Opioid Prediction & Risk-Stratification E-Platform (DEMONSTRATE) Project Summary/Abstract An unprecedented rise in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health crisis in the US. In response, health systems, payers, and policy makers have developed or adopted measures and programs to target individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. However, significant gaps exist in the current approaches to identify individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. First, the definition of ‘high-risk’ currently used by payers and health systems varies widely (ranging from high opioid dose to the number of pharmacies or prescribers a patient has visited). Second, little is known about how accurately these measures truly identify patients with overdose or OUD, and there is some evidence showing they perform poorly, missing 70% to 90% of individuals with an actual OUD diagnosis or overdose. Third, our NIDA-funded work (R01DA044985) using national Medicare and Pennsylvania Medicaid claims data has shown that machine-learning algorithms can achieve better performance for risk prediction for opioid overdose and OUD. Thus, the immediate next step is to expand our algorithms to other data sources (e.g., electronic health records [EHR]), as well as to apply state-of- the-art longitudinal neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to further improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we aim to translate these risk scores into a clinical decision tool to be used by health care systems to automatically analyze and visualize the relevant information regarding risk prediction and stratification for opioid overdose or OUD, using either claims data, EHR data, or both in real time. Leveraging our NIDA-funded work on developing machine-learning algorithms to predict opioid overdose and OUD, we propose to “develop and evaluate a machine-learning opioid prediction & risk-stratification e- platform (DEMONSTRATE)” that can be used by health care systems to identify patients at high risk for opioid overdose and OUD. We have 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will refine and validate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose/OUD using 3 different datasets (i.e., 2011-2020 Florida all-payer EHR, Florida Medicaid claims, and Florida Medicaid claims linked with EHR data) from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. We will expand our current algorithms by applying state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NLP) to improve prediction. In Aim 2, we will design and prototype a DEMONSTRATE clinical decision support tool to incorporate the best prediction algorithms to provide automatic warnings to primary care providers of patients at high risk of overdose/OUD. An iterative user-centered design approach will be used to enhance DEMONSTRATE’s functionality and usability. In Aim 3, we will integrate DEMONSTRATE into the University of Florida Health’s EHR system, and deploy and pilot test DEMONSTRATE in three primary care clinics. We will assess DEMONSTRATE’s usability, acceptability, and feasibility. Our proposed research is highly innovative in its expansion, translation, and application of a promising NIDA-funded machine-learning opioid prediction and risk stratification tool into a software platform to better inform clinical practice for improving safety of opioid use. NARRATIVES The proposed study aims to harness advanced natural language processing and longitudinal neural network approaches to build on our previously developed machine-learning prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose or opioid use disorder. We will develop the prediction tool using all-payer electronic health records (EHR), Medicaid claims, and Medicaid claims linked with EHR data from the One Florida Clinical Research Consortium and translate the risk prediction algorithms into a clinical decision support platform integrated into the EHR system to identify patients at high risk of overdose and opioid use disorder. This innovative and integrated platform will better guide clinical providers and health care systems for improving safety of opioid prescribing in clinical practice, and prevent opioid-associated adverse outcomes.",Developing and Evaluating a Machine-Learning Opioid Prediction & Risk-Stratification E-Platform (DEMONSTRATE),10119030,R01DA050676,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Behavior', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high risk', 'implementation outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neural network', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'structured data', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,701725
"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133
"Leveraging Electronic Health Records and Genomic Biobanks for Kidney Stone Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Kidney stones are highly prevalent and recurrent. Our current understanding of kidney stone disease risk factors and disease associations has relied primarily on data from chart review, nonspecific administrative datasets, and secondary analyses of observation studies. Current study designs suffer from small sample sizes, heterogenous patient groups, and lack of standardized accuracy data and outcome definitions. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides novel research opportunities for kidney stone disease. EHRs contain a robust clinical repository of data collected over time from clinical care. However, there are currently limited tools to identify and characterize kidney stone patients in the EHR. The objective of this study is to establish feasibility of utilizing EHR data to investigate kidney stone disease. To structure EHR data in an efficient and cost-effective manner, natural language processing and deep learning methods can be designed for identifying and phenotyping kidney stone patients and clinical outcomes. Our de-identified EHR is linked to a DNA biobank that can enable investigation of genetic associations with disease. This project has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform genetic association studies in our EHR and linked DNA biobank. We will replicate previously described associations with genetic variants and kidney stone disease. We will then perform a genome-wide association study to discover novel associations. In Aim 2, our goal is to develop and validate a computable framework to extract clinical outcomes of kidney stone disease from the EHR. Clinically meaningful outcomes include symptomatic stone passage and radiographic stone characterization. We will develop and test natural language processing and deep learning algorithms to extract keywords and context-based information in clinical notes and reports. We will train and test these algorithms using manual annotation as the gold standard. This aim will enable rigorous phenotyping of each kidney stone patient using structured and unstructured EHR data. Successful completion of this project will lay the groundwork towards advancing genomic medicine and precision health to support clinical decision-making in kidney stone patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to establish the feasibility of kidney stone research using electronic health record data. Genetic association studies will be performed to replicate known and discover new variants with kidney stone disease.

"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10063011,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,794994
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,10090579,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,170176
"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,10085674,R01LM012973,"['Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,366696
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV. This R03 proposal focuses on applying advanced clinical informatics to assemble a large AAV cohort and characterizing how complications co-occur (i.e., complication clusters) in AAV.",Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters,10198103,R03AR078938,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preparation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remission Induction', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Rheumatism', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Vasculitis', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'comparative efficacy', 'data resource', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'structured data', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment strategy', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,105843
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk-Taking', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'joint inflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'risk variant', 'small molecule', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,10091381,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,376860
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10171921,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Store', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2021,241411
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,10066366,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'risk prediction', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,750379
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,10103780,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,574852
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD.

"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'precision medicine', 'risk stratification', 'standard care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192
