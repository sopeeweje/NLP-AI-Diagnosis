"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,10223179,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2021,1186500
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium. RELEVANCE The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is a highly collaborative effort aiming to develop a comprehensive list of functional elements in the human genome. This proposal creates a data analysis center to provide support and computational prowess for this effort in collaboration with other ENCODE groups.

"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,10369167,R00AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R00,2021,249000
"Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY The last twenty years have experienced extensive growth in the sequencing of cancer genomes, leading to a dramatically increased understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic mutations in cancer. This has largely been enabled by developments in high-throughput “second-generation” sequencing technology and analysis that characterize cancer genomes using short-reads. Recently, a new generation of high-throughput long-read sequencing instruments, primarily from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have become available that are poised to displace short-read sequencing for many applications. We and others have used these technologies to discover tens of thousands of variants per cancer genome that are not detectable using short-reads, including structural variants and differentially methylated regions in known oncogenes and cancer risk genes. These technologies carry the potential to address many open questions in cancer biology, however, the analysis of long-read sequencing data is computationally demanding and needs specialized algorithms that are either too inefficient to use at scale or do not yet exist. In this proposal, we will address several gaps in the application of long-read technology for basic research and clinical use in cancer genomics. First, we will develop improved methods for finding structural variants and complex repeat expansions from long-reads, both of which are major diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease, yet are not accurately identified using existing methods. Leveraging the improved phasing capabilities of long reads, this work will include the detection of mosaic variants, revealing tumor heterogeneity and variants in precancerous tissues. Next, we will apply machine learning and systems level advances to accelerate and improve the comparison of variants across large patient cohorts. Critically, this will compensate for the error prone nature of single molecule long-read sequencing to make these comparisons more accurate when comparing tumor-normal samples or pedigrees of related patients so that recurrent driving mutations can be accurately identified. Finally, we will develop integrative methods for the joint analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenetic profiling of cancer genomes. These advances will improve the identification of fusion genes, and allow for entirely new forms of epigenetic analysis, such as the allele-specific analysis of methylation across transposable elements and other repetitive elements. Synthesizing the many thousands of novel variants we will detect using our methods, we will then develop algorithms that will identify and evaluate recurrent genetic or epigenetic variations as putative driving mutations. All methods will be released open-source and will empower us, our ITCR collaborators, and the cancer genomics community at large to study genetic and epigenetic variants with near perfect accuracy and thereby unlock many new associations to treatment and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emerging long-read single molecule sequencing platforms are poised to establish a new level of quality and resolution in cancer genome sequencing. Here we will develop and enhance algorithms for several important tasks in genomics with long reads, including improved genetic variation detection, transcriptional profiling, and methylation analysis. We will then work with our collaborators and other researchers to deploy these methods to develop a more complete understanding of cancer progression.",Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing,10187808,U01CA253481,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Karyotype', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fusion gene', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'power analysis', 'premalignant', 'risk variant', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,383463
"Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology. Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles. Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development. Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and improve our understanding of disease etiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year and so it remains a high priority to develop effective prevention approaches and to identify new disease specific therapies to reduce disease mortality. The research proposed here has two components: (1) To characterize the genetic component in ovarian cancer development through epigenomic landscape; (2) to establish the functional relevance of genetic findings for clinical translation. This is a highly integrated multi-disciplinary research proposal, and these approaches to novel discovery and mechanistic understanding are desperately needed to advance our basic knowledge of this disease to develop clinical interventions that reduce mortality.",Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations,10115485,K99CA256519,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Ovarian', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'population based', 'precursor cell', 'professor', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'success', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,173048
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,10054960,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,326483
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,10119300,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2021,357750
"Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project For many cancer types, the wide-spread adoption of cancer screening has increased the detection of pre-malignant lesions (PML). Despite such efforts, screening has had limited impact on overall survival. Clinical guidelines vary widely from watchful waiting (e.g., prostate) to radical surgery and adjuvant treatment (e.g., breast). In absence of reliable progression risk biomarkers and models, these interventions may have deleterious consequences at the two clinical extremes: delay in life-saving treatment or overtreatment. The study of pre-malignant lesions (PML) at molecular level present significant challenges: PML are small, generally archived in formalin. Moreover, the clinical significance of any identified marker can only be assessed after long follow- up, limiting the translational studies to retrospective collections. These hurdles have prevented the development and application of precision medicine approaches and unbiased biomarker to develop models of progression. The current proposal will extend the MCL Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP initiated in September 2017) with the goal to build multi-modal profiles of highly characterized pre-malignant lesions from the 4 target organs (Lung, Breast, Prostate and Pancreas). The four organs included represent a diverse spectrum of histology - pure histology or mixed with invasive lesions - and clinical settings - treatment or active surveillance. Similarly, the selected profiling methods are as comprehensiveas for invasive tumors atlas (whole transcriptome gene expression or DNA mutations) but also innovative, focusing on micro- environment and exploring spatial heterogeneity (multiplex IHC) and, for a few cases, cellular heterogeneity (single-nuclei sequencing). The propose extension will support the completion of the PCAPP and enable a uniform data analysis and sharing with the community.

The IGM Genomics Center offers assay design consultation, sequencing library preparation (DNA/RNA/smallRNA/targeted sequencing), single cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics), lllumina platform sequencing (MiSeq, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq 6000), and Illumina genotyping and methylation arrays. The UC Davis Center for Genomic Pathology Laboratory provides expert histology and pathology services on a recharge basis. We provide tissue processing/sectioning, routine and special tissue staining, immunohistochemistry, whole slide scanning, database hosting, help with quantitative image analysis and pathology consulting services. Proposed Work: For the budget period we will perform the following work a. PCAPP project management x Continue to organize PCAPP monthly calls: Until December 2020, these calls will be used to keep track on  progress. The goal will be to ensure that data is being generated and shared and to address any logistical  or technical question that may delay progress. In 2021, the focus of the calls will be slowly transitioning to  discuss standardized analysis and present preliminary analysis across teams and organs. x Continue to attend and collaborate with the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). In particular identify  immediate opportunities for collaboration and data sharing. x Complete the data sharing via JPL LabCAS and dbGaP. Data standardization, upload and registration is a  complex process and every member will need to be assisted to accomplish these goals. b. PCAPP data generation and analysis support x The UCSD IGM genomic center will be contracted to perfrom Exome library preparation and sequencing of  any supplemental DNA samples that need additional coverage or replication x The UCSD team will offer to assist PCAPP teams to analyze and QC their raw data. They will determine  whether the JPL cloud can be used to scale up this analysis and will provide forums and discussion board  for data generator and analyst to discuss the results and suggest novel iterations. x The UC Davis histology core facility will be contracted to perform high resolution scanning, cell counting  and analysis of the multiplex immuno-histochemistry data from the other PCAPP teams. c. Pan-PCAPP analysis, data enrichment and integration Unified data processing: The raw sequencing data (RNA and DNA) from all PCAPP teams will be re-processed at once to generate a uniform call of gene expression, mutations and copy number aberrations. Similarly, the multiplex IHC primary analysis results will be aggregated and processed at once to ensure that no team or organ specific technical differences occurs. The results of the Pan-PCAPP unified analysis will be made available in dbGaP through a new version of the data. Pan-expression analysis: Mitotic grade, immune-infiltration, presence of necrosis, or lesion morphology (papillary, cribriform, tubular, solid) may reveal commonalities across organs. Each component, or expression state, driving these differences will be annotated via gene set enrichment analysis to understand which biological signal and processes may be responsible Pan-mutational analysis: from a set of known driver genes in cancer we will build the oncomap of driver events (mutations or copy number gains and losses), annotate them for their known, likely or unknown pathogenic consequences and determine how their prevalence differs from the drivers identified in more advanced tumors. Pan-spatial immune analysis; across all PML and organs we will determine the relative number of each cell types in the stroma, defining hot, warm and cold immune states and determine their association with expression states or mutational status, after correcting for organ type. We will contract with Dr. Cambell (UCSF) to calculate the EcoScore for each PML, which will summarize a more context depend micro- environmental status, accounting for the clustering and distance between cells. We will determine whether the EcoScore is associated with specific histological features or epithelial expression states, independently of the overall immune-infiltration. Mutational burden and signature analysis: The mutational load (substitution and copy number) will be calculated for all PMLs and tested for association with expression state and histology features. Similarly for PML with sufficient number of mutations, we will determine the contribution of each of the COSMIC mutational signatures [4] to the mutational load and determine whether the presence of any signature is associated with expression state, histology features, or stromal-immune states. Stromal-Epithelial interactions: we will perform an unsupervised integration of the data to investigate stromal vs epithelial interaction. We will first select and abstract multiple epithelial features derived for RNA and DNA analysis above, such as proliferation, burden, presence of key mutational signature, organ-independent expression state (NMF cluster membership), common mutation drivers. We will then use random forest regression with 5 fold-cross validation to determine which features associate with specific stromal immune features derived from the mIHC experiments: hot / cold stroma, immuno-suppressive, proliferative T-cells, EcoScore, etc.",Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project,10269615,U2CCA233254,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial-Stromal Communication', 'Event', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene set enrichment analysis', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intervention', 'Invasive Lesion', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Papillary', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patient observation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'System', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Testing', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'computer center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'precision medicine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted sequencing', 'tissue processing', 'transcriptome', 'translational study', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U2C,2021,304550
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics,10136665,R01HG007352,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crete', 'Cytology', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Knowledge', 'Lamin Type B', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primates', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Visualization', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'frontier', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mental function', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,345658
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482
"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,10148720,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2021,597684
"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carrying Capacities', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene Delivery', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic approach', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Variant', 'adeno-associated viral vector', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'cell type', 'computational suite', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'human disease', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'intein', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'success', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871
"Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients Project Summary/Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of less than 30% for metastatic disease. Our lab has identified mutational processes as predictors of survival and response to therapy, along with a working model to predict homologous recombination deficiency from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole-slide images. Our collaborators in diagnostic radiology have discovered robust associations between BRCA mutational status and qualitative features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). These two imaging modalities, however, have yet to be combined with genomic information to improve stratification of HGSC patients. Based on these preliminary data, I will test the hypothesis that combined mesoscopic information in CE-CT and microscopic information in H&E can be used to infer known mutational subtypes and also to identify novel patient strata. I have curated a cohort of 118 HGSC patients with matched targeted panel-based genome sequencing, scanned H&E whole-slide images, and segmented pre-treatment CE-CT images for this purpose. In Specific Aim 1, I will develop a machine learning model to integrate CE-CT and H&E imaging to predict mutational subtype from these ubiquitous imaging modalities. In Specific Aim 2, I will develop an end-to-end deep learning model to integrate the complementary information from CE-CT, H&E, and genome sequencing for survival analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. I anticipate that this work will (1) identify refined stratification of HGSC patients using this multimodal prognostic signature and (2) develop a general-purpose machine learning model to integrate CE-CT, H&E, and genomic sequencing for cancer patient survival analysis. This research will be conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the mentorship of Dr. Sohrab Shah. The training plan that Dr. Shah and I have developed will prepare me well for a future as a physician- scientist conducting machine learning research for cancer patient prognosis. Project Narrative Mutational subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer stratify patients by clinical outcome, yet genomic sequencing omits spatial information with potential prognostic relevance. In the proposed project, I aim to (1) infer mutational subtype by combining radiologic and histologic imaging and (2) identify refined patient strata by integrating radiologic and histologic imaging with genomic sequencing. Completion of this work will identify new strata of ovarian cancer patients and result in new machine learning models to integrate cancer imaging with genomic sequencing.",Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients,10146152,F30CA257414,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measures', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Platinum', 'Point Mutation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Serous', 'Slide', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genome sequencing', 'health care settings', 'histological image', 'homologous recombination', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted sequencing', 'tumor', 'whole genome', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F30,2021,51036
"A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing PROJECT SUMMARY Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as new genomic medicines that address underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it remains challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. Our long-term goal is to understand and predict such unintended biological effects to advance the development of safe and effective therapies. T-cells are an ideal cellular model because: 1) they are highly relevant as the most widely used cells for development of therapeutic genome editing strategies (such as cell-based treatments for HIV and cancer) and 2) mature T-cells encode a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that can be exploited as built-in cellular barcodes for quantifying clonal expansion or depletion in response to specific treatments. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) to predict which unintended editing sites have biological effects on human T-cells by integrating large-scale genome-wide activity and epigenomic profiles with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 2) to develop a human primary T-cell platform to detect functional effects of genome editing by measuring clonal representation, off-target mutation frequencies, immunogenicity, or gene expression. If successful, our experimental and predictive framework will profoundly increase confidence in the safety of the next generation of promising genome editing therapies.

"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10155396,R01AI148470,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomass', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fermentation', 'Frustration', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Industry', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photosynthesis', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Shapes', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Yeasts', 'design', 'driving force', 'droplet sequencing', 'emerging antibiotic resistance', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2021,391250
"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual. We aim to utilize a computational method to identify such elements in the genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program.

"Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer Abstract A few germline pathogenic structural variants (SV) have been identified in cancer predisposition syndromes, e.g., MSH2 inversion in Lynch syndrome. The advent of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the detection of SVs. However, a pitfall of this sequencing methodology is the inability to capture all SVs, given the reads do not map well to low complexity regions, and current algorithms used to identify SVs from short-read data have very low sensitivity and very high false-positive rates. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to optimize and implement an SV calling pipeline that utilizes multiple algorithms to increase the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification from germline short-read WGS trios. This pipeline is currently being developed and tested on pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the NIH-funded Baylor Advancing Sequencing into Childhood Cancer Care (BASIC3) exome study, which consists of ethnically and racially diverse pediatric patients with solid (CNS and non-CNS) tumors. This BASIC3 subset includes 63 proband/parent trios who have subsequently undergone germline short-read WGS. Five SV callers are run and then filtered using either a percent reciprocal overlap filter or a proposed Artificial Intelligence-based proximity graph filter to identify de novo and inherited SVs. This cohort has recently been selected for a long-read sequencing pilot, data which serves as the gold standard for SV detection. Comparison of short-read WGS generated SV calls with the long- read data will help determine the sensitivity and specificity of variant calls and further improve the short read pipeline (Aim 1A). Once optimized this short-read WGS SV pipeline will be applied to the Kids First Genetics of Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma cohort (n=900), as an independent assessment of the method and also to identify recurrent germline SVs in this cancer which has not yet been well characterized (Aim 1B). The second training and scientific objective is to explore the functional effect of a novel de novo SV identified through the initial analysis. A de novo germline duplication of the Prostaglandin Reductase 2 (PTGR2) enhancer and promoter region was found in a pediatric Posterior Fossa subtype A (PF–A) ependymoma patient. Transcriptome data from the patient’s tumor revealed increased PTGR2 expression. The PTGR2 protein converts 15-keto- prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGE2. Studies in adult malignancies suggest that increased 15-keto- 13,14-dihydro-PGE2 is associated with cancer risk potentially through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Increased STAT3 signaling is reported as a distinct feature of PF-A ependymoma. The identified partial duplication of PTGR2 will be engineered into ependymoma progenitor cells, to functionally assess the effects on STAT3 signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis. In parallel, further analysis of PTGR2 expression and structural variants will be analyzed in pediatric ependymoma cohorts (Aim 2). Completion of this experimental plan and described training activities under Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic will provide Owen Hirschi highly interdisciplinary training in analysis of genomic data, structural variation, and the downstream effects on pediatric cancer biology. Project Narrative Structural variation occurring in the germline of pediatric patients is linked to cancer-predisposition, however the tools used to identify these events from short-read whole genome sequencing are often erroneous and limited. This project will seek to optimize a pipeline that can more accurately identify these events and determine the functional effects of one of these identified events. Such studies are essential to accurately determine how often these events occur and whether they play a broader role in pediatric cancers, as well, if these events can influence clinical care and potential cancer prevention.",Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer,10314873,F31CA265163,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Ependymoma', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dinoprostone', 'Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Enrollment', 'Ependymal Cell', 'Ependymoma', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Inherited', 'Interleukin-6', 'Link', 'MSH2 gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neuroglia', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Play', 'Posterior Fossa', 'Predisposition', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostaglandins', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Role', 'Running', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stat3 Signaling Pathway', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Tumor Promoters', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer care', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional gain', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'proband', 'promoter', 'racial diversity', 'stem cells', 't(9', '22)(q34', 'q11)', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,43631
"Statistical methods for cancer progression delineation and subtype identification Project Summary  Carcinogenesis is a complex process involving somatic mutations in a number of key biological pathways and processes. Full study of the temporal order of somatic mutation occurrences is very important to understand biological mechanisms of cancer development and to inform new therapeutic targets and treatment options. The first and most recognized example of order of mutations is from colon cancer, which is frequently initiated by mutations that affect the Wnt signaling pathway, and then progress upon subsequent mutations in genes involved in MAPK, PI3K, TGF-beta, and p53 signaling pathways. However, for many other cancer types, temporal orders of mutations are still largely unknown. Somatic mutation profiling via high throughput DNA sequencing has provided an unprecedented opportunity for using statistical/computational methods to study cancer progression. We and others have developed methods to infer temporal order of somatic mutations based on combining mutation profile data from a cohort of patients. However, one major limitation of current methods is that they only consider presence or absence of mutations in a patient’s tumor, but do not take into account intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH). The ITH refers to the presence of multiple cell populations, i.e. subclones, with distinct mutation profiles within a patient’s tumor. The ITH, which can be inferred from either single-/multi-region bulk sequencing or single cell sequencing, is usually characterized by a phylogenetic tree with nodes in the tree indicating different subclones and edges indicating the evolutionary relationships of subclones. As a phylogenetic tree describes the temporal order of mutations within an individual patient’s tumor, incorporating such in-depth intra-patient information into the tumor progression analysis across patients is likely to substantially increase the power and accuracy of the analysis. Another important priority in cancer research is to identify molecular subtypes. As cancer is a complex disease, patients of the same cancer type may have very different prognoses and responses to therapy. Further classifying patients into subtypes allows clinicians to better predict a patient’s clinical outcomes and design more personalized treatment strategies. By harnessing omics profiling data, statistical/machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to identify molecular cancer subtypes. However, due to the high complexity of cancer omics data and limited sample size, it is still challenging to obtain stable and biologically interpretable results. Recently, it has been advocated that incorporating biological knowledge and structure into the construction of statistical/machine learning models is a viable approach to improve the mechanistic interpretability and robustness of the models. To advance current capabilities, we propose to develop new statistical methods to better estimate the temporal order of pathway mutations by integrating ITH, pathway and mutational functional annotation information, and thereby, to classify patients into biologically meaningful subtypes. Project Narrative This project aims to develop new statistical methods to delineate temporal order of pathway mutations during tumorigenesis and identify cancer subtypes with different cancer progression mechanisms. The success of this project will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer progression and enable better classification of cancer patients into subtypes, which can potentially impact drug development and clinical practice.",Statistical methods for cancer progression delineation and subtype identification,10201322,R03CA259670,"['Adenocarcinoma Cell', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appalachian Region', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cancer Cluster', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Knowledge', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'TP53 gene', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Trees', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'molecular subtypes', 'new therapeutic target', 'p53 Signaling Pathway', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R03,2021,74902
"Single cell quantification of genomic instability in cancer as a determinant of therapeutic response PROJECT ABSTRACT Tumor genetic heterogeneity is an extensive feature of cancer biology and underlies patient response to therapy. One aspect of tumor heterogeneity that has been difficult to study is heterogeneity of large genomic aberrations, including high level amplifications a few megabases in size, whole or partial chromosomal gains and losses and whole genome duplications. This is because identifying these aberrations in subclonal populations (present in <100% of cells) is extremely challenging when sequencing tumors in “bulk”. Single cell genomics however, can resolve these alterations at cellular resolution enabling precise quantification of heterogeneity at these genomic length scales. To comprehensively investigate the extent and consequences of intra-tumor heterogeneity generated by these types of genomic aberrations I will leverage recent advances in robust highly scalable single cell whole genome sequencing and my expertise in computational modeling. In the K99 phase of the award I will investigate how differences in the ability of cells to repair their genomes results in different patterns of genetic heterogeneity, and how such cellular diversity can cause differential response to treatment in high grade serous ovarian cancer, a cancer driven by genomic instability. In the independent phase of the award I will focus on heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics of extra-chromosomal DNA, small circular pieces of DNA that cause high level amplification of oncogenes. The results of this proposal have the potential to give fundamental new insight into the biology of genomic instability and enable better predication of patient response to therapy and identification of therapeutic vulnerability that may be exploited. This proposal also describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator, combining computational modeling inspired by evolutionary theory, machine learning and high-resolution genomics to quantify cancer evolution in order to better predict patient response to therapy and uncover the mechanisms driving cancer progression. During the K99 phase I will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts in single cell genomics, cancer evolution, ovarian cancer biology and genomic instability. I will broaden my knowledge of machine learning, genomic instability and scalable bioinformatics software engineering and improve my communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this research proposal we will study how the instability inherent to the genomes of cancer cells impact patient response to therapy. We envisage that the results from this proposal will enable better prediction of patient response to therapy and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities that may be exploited to design more effective therapies.",Single cell quantification of genomic instability in cancer as a determinant of therapeutic response,10115351,K99CA256508,"['Aftercare', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CCNE1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal Gain', 'Chromosomal Loss', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immersion', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Software Engineering', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'chromosome missegregation', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'extrachromosomal DNA', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic aberrations', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient response', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'whole genome']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2021,99798
