"BRAIN Initiative: Assessing development of event-related cortical network dynamics Project Summary The Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network (HBN) is an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of brain and behavioral data now being collected from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). In response to RFA-MH-120-20 (‘Integration and analysis of BRAIN Initiative data’), we will collect their high-density EEG and continuous eye tracking data, recorded from now over 3,000 young participants while they watch movies and rest, plus participant MR head images, to create a developmental EEG and eye tracking data and analysis resource within the BRAIN Initiative-funded NEMAR portal (NEMAR.org) to the OpenNeuro human neuroimaging resource (OpenNeuro.org). We will store the data in accord with the latest advances in the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS), including innovative co-registration of eye-tracking information and EEG, extraction of anonymized Leadfield matrices for advanced participant-based source localization, and Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) annotation of movie and eye tracking events in the data, to enable sophisticated exploratory and model-based analyses by any user of the Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), which offers processing of complex tasks on the U.S. XSEDE computer network (XSEDE.org) for users of standard neuroscience software. We propose to build on the large existing and readily extensible set of tools for analysis, modeling, and visualization of human EEG data in the world leading EEGLAB software environment for electrophysiological signal processing we develop and maintain (5R01-NS047293-15) (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), to process the large corpus of innovative EEG and synchronous eye tracking data recorded during movie viewing by the HBN project. We will then apply source-resolved event-related analysis models to cortical EEG network dynamics associated with movie watching, will model their changes across development, and will compare the time course of these changes with changes in eye gaze patterns at the same age levels. We will use cortical source-resolved, event-related functional EEG connectivity measures implemented in the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT) to model event-related EEG dynamics of individual participants, and will apply advanced hierarchical Bayes-based methods and statistical assessment to perform statistical testing on subject group models. We will study the development of event-related cortical information flow during movie watching and rest across the large HBN developmental (5-21 years) sample, and compare it to the developmental trajectory of changes in eye gaze patterns during movie viewing. Project narrative. The Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network is collecting and sharing a biobank of brain and behavioral data from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). We will upload high-density EEG and continuous eye tracking data from this project recorded during movie watching and rest to an integrated data, tools, and computer analysis resource, the NEMAR portal to the BRAIN Initiative OpenNeuro human neuroimaging resource.

"The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function Innovations in human neuroimaging tools have driven profound advances in our understanding of brain function under well-controlled and constrained conditions. While we are gaining greater understanding of how the brain functions in single-snapshot experiments under restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-world environments. The goal of this project is to build a portable, miniaturized, lightweight, high-density wearable combined – functional Near Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Electro-Encepholography (EEG) - Eye-tracking system for enabling “Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW)” by permitting long duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings (>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and (C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state- of-the-art computer vision for adaptive acquisition and automated data annotation. In Aim 2, we will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements. This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations, we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology, and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links between brain activity and behavior will build. There is a need to link brain activity to human movement, perception and cognition, and social communication in real time, and in the Everyday World. This project aims to develop a multi- modal wearable functional neuroimaging device to study brain function in freely behaving healthy subjects and to track the breakdown of normal brain function potentially revealing brain patterns that are signatures of these conditions.",The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function,10263915,U01EB029856,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Walking', 'Work', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'hemodynamics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light weight', 'millisecond', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'social communication', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),U01,2021,1000000
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,10175064,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,543993
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Clip', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagination', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'career', 'cost', 'density', 'diffuse optical tomography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'light weight', 'mental imagery', 'motor impairment', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,10129873,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app', 'web-based intervention']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,924106
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auras', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Community Hospitals', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focal Seizure', 'Forehead', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective therapy', 'encryption', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'remote monitoring', 'sensor', 'social', 'standard of care']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,999853
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities. The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders aims to strengthen the scientific base and increase the research capacity of the discipline, which will lead to improvements in the communication health of millions people with communication or related disorders. The Symposium presentations will advance the scientific dialogue and be broadly disseminated through freely available peer-reviewed publications and transcribed recordings. The associated Travel Award will provide funds to support 130 promising early-career scientists in attending the Research Symposium and engaging in mentored research activities before, during, after the Symposium to increase their recruitment and retention in a research career.",Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders,10070224,R13DC003383,"['Address', 'American Speech-Language-Hearing Association', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communication Disability', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome Measure', 'Peer Review', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Slide', 'Speech', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial implementation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'online community', 'recruit', 'social media', 'stem', 'symposium', 'web site']",NIDCD,AMERICAN SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSN,R13,2021,39900
