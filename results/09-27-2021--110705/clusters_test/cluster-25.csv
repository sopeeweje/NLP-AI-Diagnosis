"Methods and Tools for Integrating Pathomics Data into Cancer Registries The goal of this project is to enrich SEER registry data with high‐quality population‐based biospecimen data in the form of digital pathology, machine learning based classifications and quantitative pathomics feature sets. We will create a well‐curated repository of high‐quality digitized pathology images for subjects whose data is being collected by the registries. These images will be processed to extract computational features and establish deep linkages with registry data, thus enabling the creation of information‐rich, population cohorts containing objective imaging and clinical attributes. Specific examples of digital Pathology derived feature sets include quantification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and segmentation and characterization of cancer or stromal nuclei. Features will also include spectral and spatial signatures of the underlying pathology. The scientific premise for this approach stems from increasing evidence that information extracted from digitized pathology images (pathomic features) are a quantitative surrogate of what is described in a pathology report. The important distinction being that these features are quantitative and reproducible, unlike human observations that are highly qualitative and subject to a high degree of inter‐ and intra‐observer variability. This dataset will provide, a unique, population‐wide tissue based view of cancer, and dramatically accelerate our understanding of the stages of disease progression, cancer outcomes, and predict and assess therapeutic effectiveness.  This work will be carried out in collaboration with three SEER registries. We will partner with The New Jersey State Cancer Registry during the development phase of the project (UG3). During the validation phase of the project (UH3), the Georgia and Kentucky State Cancer Registries will join the project. The infrastructure will be developed in close collaboration with SEER registries to ensure consistency with registry processes, scalability and ability support creation of population cohorts that span multiple registries. We will deploy visual analytic tools to facilitate the creation of population cohorts for epidemiological studies, tools to support visualization of feature clusters and related whole‐slide images while providing advanced algorithms for conducting content based image retrieval. The scientific validation of the proposed environment will be undertaken through three studies in Prostate Cancer, Lymphoma and NSCLC, led by investigators at the three sites.

"Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in males in the United States. Despite high incidence and tremendous human and economic impact of PCa, there is no good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Commonly used blood test for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is inexpensive but lack specificity for clinically significant PCa. Over the last decade, multi- parametric prostate MRI has been shown to have an increasingly important role in the detection and localization of clinically significant PCa. Despite the demonstrated value of prostate MRI, there are two major challenges in clinical implementation of prostate MRI as a first-line screening tool at a population level: (1) high cost of the scanner and the exam, which decreases accessibility, and (2) lack of robustness of the MRI exam. To overcome these limitations we propose establishing a low-field, robust, widely accessible, and thus low- cost high-performance MRI system for PCa screening. Major challenges for imaging at lower field strength is the lower signal to noise (SNR) and thus longer acquisition times compared to 1.5 and 3.0 T. In this proposal we aim to address these efficiency and scan time challenges at low field. Our team of clinical and imaging scientists will bring to bear novel acquisition and reconstruction techniques to restore SNR, specifically random matrix theory (RMT- a technique our center has recently introduced), and deep-learning- based image reconstruction (an area our group has helped to pioneer). We will evaluate these techniques in healthy volunteers and patients with PCa. Subsequently, we will perform head-to-head comparison of low-field bi-parametric exam to routine clinical 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI exams in 30 patients with known or suspected PCa. Project Narrative Although Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer- related mortality in men in the U.S., there is a lack of a good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Multi- parametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in detecting and localizing clinically significant PCa, but cost and accessibility of conventional MRI limits its use as a first-line screening test. Therefore, we propose establishing a low-field, robust, accessible, and thus low-cost, high- performance MRI methodology for screening clinically significant PCa.",Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer,10111669,R21CA256324,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Helium', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Intestines', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Ownership', 'PSA screening', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinically significant', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'economic impact', 'head-to-head comparison', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prostate lesions', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'theories', 'volunteer']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,237724
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,10115670,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,452748
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,10005144,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'PD-1 blockade', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'ipilimumab', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'phase I trial', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2021,2275599
"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,10145619,R01CA241666,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fingerprint', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune system', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nanostructures', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Silanes', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Width', 'Woman', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'cancer type', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'early screening', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'multiplex detection', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'nanoscale', 'nanosized', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vesicle transport', 'vesicular release']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,533280
"PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research Project Summary Understanding protein–ligand molecular interactions is fundamental to understanding the role of proteins in complex diseases such as cancer. For instance, there is growing interest in predicting the binding modes of peptide-based ligands (e.g., cyclic and phosphorylated peptides) to inhibit or induce targeted degradation of high-proﬁle cancer targets. Another promising example is the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens for cancer immunotherapy applications. Both examples involve very speciﬁc molecular interactions, provide opportunities for computer-aided design of better cancer treatments, and highlight the need for structural analyses in cancer research. They also require new methods that account for the ﬂexibility and variability of the protein receptors involved in these molecular interactions. The objective of this project is to develop an integrated approach to the structural modeling and analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research that will be implemented in the proteomics toolkit PROTEAN-CR. The proposed toolkit will adopt a data-science approach to the problem by introducing approaches for data acquisition and aggregation, as well as algorithmic advances for handling receptor ﬂexibility and for modeling driver mutations, drug-resistance polymorphisms, and post-translational modiﬁcations. PROTEAN-CR will streamline running structural analyses at scale while providing meaningful data analytics. The long-term goal of our research is to fully integrate three-dimensional structural information about proteins and ligands and structural analysis into cancer research. The PIs will work with collaborators to target a wide range of users, from experimentalists with little to no programming experience, to advanced users who are comfortable scripting large-scale analyses and integrating the toolkit with their own computational pipeline. The central hypothesis is that a uniﬁed data-science-inspired approach can be used to address major challenges in structural analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research at scale. The ﬁrst aim will incorporate protein ﬂexibility in docking studies for cancer research. Speciﬁc workﬂows will be used to generate ensembles of protein conformations (receptor ﬂexibility) and innovative machine learning methods will be implemented aiming at a better scoring of protein–ligand complexes. The second aim will focus on including cancer variability into structural analysis. We aim to ﬁll the gap that exists between available data on cancer variants and the structural analysis of ensembles of tumor-associated mutations and protein modiﬁcations. Finally, the third aim will focus on customization, interpretability and scalability, where user-friendly methods will be deployed to manage ensembles of protein-ligand complexes. PROTEAN-CR will be developed focusing on speciﬁc cancer-related projects, and with a broad network of collaborators, enabling the design, implementation and evolution of the tool according to the needs of the cancer research community. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it employs an innovative data-science approach to make molecular structural analysis accessible to cancer researchers. The toolkit that will implement and harden this approach will be made freely available to advance efforts to discover key mechanisms inherent to cancer, enabling the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. The proposed software toolkit will integrate data acquisition, computation, analytics and visualization with emphasis on three fronts: (a) ﬂexibility, allowing the sampling of conformations taking into account receptor as well as the ligand dynamics; (b) variability, allowing the user to simulate proteins with cancer-associated mutations and post-translational modiﬁcations; and (c) scalability, giving researchers the opportunity to process and analyze large amounts of structural data, using intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.",PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research,10188196,U01CA258512,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cellular immunotherapy', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'HLA Antigens', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Mythology', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Peptides', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'RNA Editing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'peptide based vaccine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'scale up', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'web app']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,402077
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.  The requested funds will be used to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the device in a larger clinical study needed to enable regulatory approval of the device.",Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing,10127607,R44CA250768,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Assessment tool', 'Basal Cell', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Detection', 'Device Approval', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Family Practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hand functions', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malpractice', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasms', 'Nevus', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Optics', 'Painless', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Pigments', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening for Skin Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Vascular resistance', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical pressure', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'peace', 'pressure', 'provider behavior', 'response', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'skin lesion', 'tumor', 'vascular abnormality']",NCI,"VERISKIN, INC.",R44,2021,833460
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,10172866,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'diagnostic technologies', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,397823
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,10238766,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,378722
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities.

"OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions Project Summary/Abstract In this cycle of the project, we will extend OpenIGTLink software to enable individualized precision guidance, where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image- guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination. The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model- based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models in vivo needle placement. Project Narrative Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in biopsy and focal ablation of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate free open-source software named OpenIGTLink to support advanced image-guided robot-assisted systems, where a robotic system guides a needle into the prostate based on biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models that predict the tissue and needle deformation in the patient during insertion. We expect that the accurate prediction will enable individualized planning and control for robot-assisted needle placement and improve accuracy biopsy and focal ablation.",OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions,10211359,R01EB020667,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brachytherapy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'individual patient', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'real-time images', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'robotic system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,701392
"Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi- center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gauging electrical properties of surgical margins during tumor resection procedures has the potential to alert surgeons to regions of cancer not fully extracted and subsequently reduce the number of positive surgical margins which are significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. The intraoperative electrical property sensing/imaging probe and the visualization tools proposed here will provide an accurate, rapid, and cost- effective method for gauging these surgical margins for multiple cancer types. We will explore this technology in the context of prostate cancer surgery with the expectation that this will further advance the study of electrical property signatures of normal and diseased tissue in vivo and help to translate this technology to the clinic.",Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment,10218115,R01CA237654,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bladder Control', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nephrectomy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pelvic floor structure', 'Periprostatic', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Urethra', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'expectation', 'feasibility trial', 'flexibility', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'man', 'men', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'programs', 'prostate surgery', 'prototype', 'safety and feasibility', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'urinary bladder neck']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,478142
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",10166783,U54CA209988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,1851265
"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited.

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10239049,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'dissemination strategy', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'unethical', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,517978
"THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of CEDAR in cancer research. NARRATIVE Progress in the use of epitopes for cancer immunology and immunotherapy is hampered by a disconnect in information technology, which segregates investigators from the data and tools needed to appropriately conduct their research. Development of a Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource will overcome this issue by harmonizing and centralizing the capture of cancer epitope data, and by using these data to establish and evaluate epitope analysis and prediction tools that will be made freely available to the research community.",THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187436,U24CA248138,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Histology', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Intuition', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Cell', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'T-Cell Immunologic Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost effective', 'data tools', 'database structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'single cell sequencing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'web site', 'web-accessible']",NCI,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U24,2021,839852
"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,10112096,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2021,38109
"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: · continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, · leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a  common analysis pipeline, · develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and · support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The laboratory mouse is an important model system for investigating the genetics and biological principles of cancer and as a preclinical platform for testing new therapeutic approaches to treating cancer in humans.

"Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations 1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available  2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a  3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause  4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small  5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called  6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before  7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the  8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which 9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and 10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown 11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in 12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are 13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer 14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed 15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin. 16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of 17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the 18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily 19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to 20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely 21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual 22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage 23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used 24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies 25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin 26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the 27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment 28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions. 29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers 30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology. UV-induced clonogenic mutations (CMs) can be used to evaluate an individual's overall sun exposure and the status of sun-induced genotoxicity in the skin which can profoundly impact how we diagnosis and treat early stage skin cancer. CMS can be used to evaluate therapeutic response to field treatments for skin cancer. CMS can be used to rapidly evaluate strategies for the prevention of skin cancer, such as the genoprotective efficacy of sunscreens or an individual's adherence to sunscreen application.",Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations,10097574,R01CA255242,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermis', 'Erythema', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Redness', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Squamous Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sun protection factor', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'UV carcinogenesis', 'UV induced', 'UV protection', 'UV sensitive', 'UVB induced', 'Ultraviolet B Radiation', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care outcomes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy evaluation', 'genetic variant', 'genotoxicity', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mouse model', 'photoprotection', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive panel', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'skin cancer prevention', 'skin damage', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'standard of care', 'sun damage', 'sun protection', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,596193
"Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate cancer Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts more men in the U.S. than any other malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death in this population. Recently, new therapies have improved survival in some men but have offered little benefit to others. Tissue profiling has identified genes and pathways associated with resistance and progression to advanced disease, but little is known about the dynamics of when and how such changes arise during therapy. Such insights can only be gained through minimally invasive monitoring that allows repeated disease profiling over time. Our multidisciplinary team has developed and tested two such minimally invasive monitoring capabilities: The first is multi-parametric liquid biopsy: streamlined analysis of blood samples that simultaneously measures PC-relevant cellular and molecular features from single circulating tumor cells and matched plasma cell-free nucleic acids. The second is radiomic analysis: high-throughput extraction of quantitative metrics to identify PC-relevant phenomic imaging features. By synergizing the strengths of the two methods, our goal is to test the hypothesis that liquid biopsy and radiomic techniques can be applied jointly to monitor metastatic PC noninvasively over time, culminating in new prognostic and predictive tools to guide therapy. To maximize the impact of our findings, liquid biopsy profiling and radiomic analysis will be integrated into Southwest Oncology (SWOG) S1802, a phase 3 prospective therapeutic trial for over 1200 men with newly diagnosed metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) treated with standard systemic therapy alone or in combination with definitive treatment of the primary tumor. Notably, SWOG and the other participating cooperative groups have reviewed and approved this proposal (see Letters of Support), and the requisite blood samples and CT scans already are being collected as part of the active protocol. In this unique setting, we will pursue three Specific Aims. We will: 1. Use multi-parametric liquid biopsies to monitor the evolving cellular and molecular landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; 2. Use radiomic analysis of CT scans to monitor the evolving radiographic landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; and 3. Integrate cellular, molecular, and radiomic data to develop composite disease monitoring models predictive of PFS and OS. Importantly, liquid biopsies and CT images will be matched within patients and analyzed at key inflection points over the course of the trial: at diagnosis, after initiation of systemic therapy, after definitive therapy, and at disease progression. In this way, the proposed work will illuminate when and how PC-relevant phenotypes arise during therapy, and how they relate to clinical outcomes. In particular, we will better understand which components of the liquid biopsy – circulating cells, plasma, or both – most accurately reflect the tumor's evolving molecular profile, which radiomic metrics most closely correlate with these molecular features and can serve as early cost-effective indicators of emerging resistance, and which composite models combining liquid biopsy and radiomic features best predict PFS and OS and can serve as powerful minimally-invasive tools to monitor and adjust therapy. Project Narrative Prostate cancer is the most common and second most lethal malignancy in U.S. men, and better tools are needed to monitor disease and guide therapy. We propose to combine analysis of liquid biopsies (peripheral blood samples) with quantified evaluation of CT scans to monitor disease over time in a phase 3 multi-center clinical trial for men with metastatic prostate cancer. By integrating these modalities and the data we generate from them in a large prospective cohort, we will develop and validate new minimally invasive signatures of disease response and resistance that predict survival and can be used to monitor and optimize treatment in real time.",Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate cancer,10154662,R01CA257610,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Site', 'Synaptophysin', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'men', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'phase III trial', 'phenomics', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'survival prediction', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,706071
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,10049232,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,599950
"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The risk for gastric cancer in the general population of the United States is low; however, certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups are at much higher risk.

"Development of a Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Generation of Cancer Probability Maps and Imaging Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men. There is a large discrepancy between the incidence of the disease and its mortality rate. Thus, the development of screening tools to identify prostate cancer and determine if it is aggressive or indolent is an area of considerable interest. Current methods rely on the use of serum biomarkers and follow-up biopsies for screening. However, there is substantial debate as to the appropriate methodology for screening. The goal of this proposal is the development of: 1) new imaging biomarkers (i.e., “features”) for prostate cancer; and 2) a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma. These tools will enable more effective use of mp-MRI in prostate cancer screening in the future and thus enable a future improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of screening, reducing the rates of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Aim 1: To implement a deep learning algorithm for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences, creating a cancer prob- ability map that is predictive of biopsy results. Aim 2: To create a multimodal framework that will combine discovered imaging features with clinical data points from the medical record (e.g., age, risk factors, medical history, biomarkers) to predict the presence and aggressiveness of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: In Aim 1, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on a clinical dataset comprised of patches extracted from pre-prostatectomy mp-MRI sequences from patients with prostate cancer, using his- topathology analysis of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens as ground truth. The innovations in this aim will be the development of a CNN that can simultaneously learn from three different imaging sequence types, the use of patches for data augmentation, and the proper alignment of mp-MRI sequences and prostatectomy specimens for machine learning. The result of the work of this aim will be the creation of an algorithm for gen- erating imaging biomarkers (features) and cancer probability maps from mp-MRI data. In Aim 2, a multimodal learning framework that will integrate mp-MRI sequence data with clinical parameters in order to predict the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma will be developed. The innovation in this aim will be the devel- opment of a framework that can integrate information from multiple modalities (imaging, serum, history, etc.) in order to generate a high confidence prediction of the presence of aggressive prostate cancer without the use of invasive testing. Long-term Objective: The development of a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate mp-MRI data that will enable better future use of this data for the early detection of prostate cancer. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men. This research aims to develop imaging features and a predictive model that will enable better use of mul- tiparametric MRI for noninvasive prostate cancer screening, which could reduce over- and underdiagnosis in order to provide better care at lower cost.",Development of a Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Generation of Cancer Probability Maps and Imaging Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI,9723045,F30CA210329,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostatectomy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'denoising', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'risk stratification', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'secondary outcome', 'serum PSA', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2021,39534
"Developing deep learning models for precision oncology Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.  We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data, including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer ontology and promote the development of precision medicine. Project Narrative Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed project aims to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning, to study cellular signaling systems and disease mechanism. A better representation embedded in the cancer omics data will improve the prediction of drug sensitivity and patient survival.

"Sustaining the Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and other computationally intensive methods have the potential to revolutionize cancer imaging research and patient care. The broad adoption of these technologies depends on the availability development of imaging informatics tools to assist users in managing massive data sets, generating well-curated annotations, and accessing scalable computing resources. The Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center has played a lead role in implementing cancer imaging informatics technology, with a focus on expanding the widely used open source XNAT informatics platform to better support computational workflows in cancer imaging. I3CR has also developed knowledge management tools to better track data processing and analysis, including tools for orchestrating and tracking container-based computing pipelines. As result of this work, XNAT has emerged as the most widely used imaging informatics platform in cancer research. It is deployed in over 200 organizations across academia and industry and has been adopted across a wide range of research contexts, including preclinical imaging, multi-site clinical trials, and clinical translation. As the I3CR informatics platform has matured and been widely adopted, the Center is now evolving to the next phase of development to more broadly sustain the platform. In the work proposed here, we will sustain the I3CR’s ongoing engineering initiatives and expand its outreach efforts. The Center’s sustainment activities will build on and extend the I3CR platform’s expansive set of data and knowledge management capabilities, with a focus on addressing key emergent needs within our user base. In Aim 1, we will continue to develop the XNAT-based data management platform, including adding standards-based clinical interfaces, developing a cohort discovery service with natural language processing support, implementing a task automation service, and extending its container-based computing service to support high performance computing and cloud computing environments. In Aim 2, we will implement a suite of integrations with complementary image analysis and data sharing platforms, including The Cancer Image Archive and the NCI Imaging Data Commons. In Aim 3, we will expand the I3CR’s outreach initiatives to ensure broad and effective adoption of the I3CR informatics platforms. The Center’s training program will utilize the XNAT Academy education platform to host a series of online training programs directed at specific audiences including developers, data scientists, integrators, and system administrators. A suite of supporting cloud services will be implemented assist the community in adopting and developing on the I3CR platform.

"Extraction of Symptom Burden from Clinical Narratives of Cancer Patients using Natural Language Processing Project Summary / Abstract Cancer patients frequently experience high levels of pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing, often related to the disease itself, its treatments, or both. This high symptom burden leads to significant impairment of cancer patients’ quality of life and may be associated with impaired survival. Optimal symptom management is required to minimize symptom burden and maximize quality of life for cancer patients throughout the course of their disease. Supportive care in cancer (SCC) teams are multidisciplinary teams that are focused on the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatments across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. These teams typically lack the resources to see all cancer patients and need to prioritize patients with the highest need, often relying on oncology physicians for referral. However, oncology physicians are often too focused on curing cancer than treating its symptoms. As a result, SCC services are often accessed by chance even when available, often later in the cancer trajectory. To improve recognition of SCC needs and to identify the symptom burden of cancer patients for better management and care, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches that can automatically extract symptom information from unstructured narratives. The proposed systems will utilize neural nets and build on the state of the art information extraction methods. To accomplish our goals, we will create a dataset of clinical notes for a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020. We focus on these two types of cancer as examples of two very different and prevalent cancer types. We propose to represent symptom burden documented in clinical narratives with a generalizable frame representation that captures fine-grained details including presence/absence, change-of- state, severity, characteristics, duration, frequency, and anatomy information related to patient symptoms. We will use active learning to create a diverse and representative gold standard annotated with symptom frames to train and test the proposed neural-based NLP approaches. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source resources. After successful completion of the project, the developed NLP methods will be integrated into the information access methods of SCCA and HCI clinical repositories. Project Narrative Cancer patients commonly experience pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing as well as impaired quality of life due to complications of the cancer itself, and/or cancer treatments. In this project, we will develop natural language processing (NLP) approaches to automatically extract detailed symptom information documented in clinical narratives of a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020.

"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There has been significant work in creating tools that leverage computer vision algorithms to automate medical image analysis. Most of these algorithms have been developed for natural images, which are usually single static images that can be treated individually. However, medical images are usually part of a study that may include various views and orientations that are considered together with other clinical data when making a diagnosis. Three dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN) can address this issue in part when images are evenly spaced, but many medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, and biopsy imaging have variable orientations and irregular spacing. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have the potential to address this issue as they generalize the assumptions of CNNs to work on arbitrarily structured graphs. Automatic thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound (US) is one application that such a graph-based approach could have a large impact. The thyroid cancer incidence rate has tripled in the past thirty years, with an estimated cost of $18-21 billon in 2019. US is the imaging modality of choice, which consists of multiple 2D images of different locations and orientations. US readings are often vague and subjective in nature, which has resulted in a steady increase in the number of biopsies performed over the past 20 years. It is estimated that about one-third of all thyroid biopsy procedures performed in the United States are medically unnecessary, leading to the unmet need for noninvasive diagnostic tests that can reliably identify which nodules require a biopsy. The research objective of this R21 is to develop a new graph-based approach to leverage spatial information contained within imaging studies that will be combined with biomarkers and other known risk factors. Our graph model will enable more complete detection of thyroid cancer, as well as the prediction of future cancer aggression, both with spatially localized explanations. GCN features will be used to predict voxel-level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical image analysis plays an important role in computer aided detection and diagnosis, but usually focuses on individual images in isolation. Graph convolutional networks have the ability to utilize the relationships be- tween images in a study to aggregate information and make a more accurate evaluation. The focus of this project is to implement a graph-based approach for distinguishing indolent from aggressive thyroid cancer, thus pre- venting patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative functional outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging,10110934,R21EB030691,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nodule', 'Nomograms', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'functional outcomes', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'risk stratification', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment', 'ward']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,224566
"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers. The findings will facilitate the optimal usage of existing drugs and the development of novel therapies for pediatric cancer, and will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career as an expert in this area.",Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells,10112859,K99CA248944,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Screening for cancer', 'Seasons', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translations', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'chemical genetics', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'experimental study', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,K99,2021,105802
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy validation', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,438819
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,10086856,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,309176
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",10116983,U01CA239055,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Oncology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'cohort', 'combat', 'companion diagnostics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1
"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),10201527,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'detection platform', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,816240
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,10085670,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,356700
"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,9929565,U01CA220401,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer survival', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'interactive tool', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplasm resource', 'non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma patients', 'open source', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,437968
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156
"Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression Abstract  Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best. An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?  To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4 we will validate classifiers in large cohorts. Project Narrative  Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making; namely, can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?",Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression,10146314,R01CA249899,"['Apoptosis', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Formalin', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Indolent', 'Infiltration', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'PI3K/AKT', 'PSA screening', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Pathway', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prostate cancer progression', 'serum PSA', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,795107
"Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Big Data has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and care, but extracting the information it holds on the optimal strategies for cancer control will require cutting-edge tools in data science. The optimal strategies for cancer control will be dynamic strategies that adapt clinical decisions over time to a patient’s evolving clinical history. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods cannot appropriately compare dynamic strategies, so we need methods specifically designed for this task: g-methods. G-methods have helped to shape clinical care in many areas, but they have not been systematically applied to cancer research. Further, while g-methods let us validly estimate the effect of pre-specified strategies, these may not be the optimal strategies. My overarching goal is to apply and further develop analytic methods to learn the optimal strategies for cancer control from complex longitudinal data and generate user-friendly, publicly-available software to make these methods available to the cancer research community. I will apply these methods to answer key clinical questions across the prostate cancer control continuum: 1) the optimal dietary and lifestyle strategies to prevent aggressive prostate cancer, 2) the optimal screening strategy following a baseline PSA test to maximize detection of aggressive disease while minimizing detection of indolent tumors, and 3) the optimal statin therapy strategy to maximize survival among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. This project will leverage data from a large prospective cohort study and a novel platform of electronic health records linked with genetic data. I will first apply g-methods to estimate the effects of recommended strategies for cancer control that a randomized trial would have limited feasibility to evaluate. I will then investigate whether novel methods that learn the optimal strategies from the data may lead to improved, targeted recommendations that get the right interventions to the right people at the right time. This innovative project will advance comparative effectiveness research for cancer care at the cutting edge of data science. I am optimally positioned to undertake this research based on my 1) expertise in cancer, epidemiology, and causal inference; 2) exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of global leaders in their respective fields; and 3) unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this work, I will expand my expertise in new areas, including machine learning. The proposed research and training will help me achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator and lead a transdisciplinary research program that integrates causal inference and machine learning to identify optimal strategies for cancer control. Leveraging rich, existing data, this proposal represents a significant opportunity to develop, apply, and disseminate powerful methods for big clinical data to accelerate progress in cancer research and care.
