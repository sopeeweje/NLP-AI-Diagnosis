"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,10086077,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2021,161528
"A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder PROJECT ABSTRACT  The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. It has led to an increased incidence of opioid overdose, injection substance use, and, eventually, HIV transmission. More than 171,000 people in the United States are living with HIV as a result of substance use disorder (SUD). Despite the known fact that both HIV and SUD significantly disturbs both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, their underlying molecular mechanisms, and interplay to immune dysfunction remain unexplored. Comprehensive functional characterization at a single-cell resolution is essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of immune dysfunction up HIV infection and SUD. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR- seq) with high-dimensional, multi-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the transcriptional, epigenetic, and network alterations and to key immune dysfunction drivers associated with HIV and SUD. Specifically, we will (1) Integrate novel functional genomics assays with single-cell multi-omics data to construct cell-type-specific multi-modal gene regulatory network (GRNs) in healthy individuals, (2) build a comprehensive immune profiling data hub for HIV/SUD-affected individuals and construct disease- and cell-type-specific GRNs, (3) uncover how key network changes and aberrant behaviors of TFs upon HIV infection and/or SUD can lead to immune dysfunction. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on transcriptome analyses, this proposed work presents a genuinely novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles at a single-cell resolution. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements at a single-cell resolution will expand the number of known functional regions. The constructed immune cell atlas, GRNs, and identify key drivers of immune dysfunction will be accessible to the public via web services and annotation databases. Our integrative computational efforts will be released distributed open-source programs. Altogether, our released resource will accelerate research in the broader scientific community by providing essential tools to investigate immune function, which will benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of immune system function of HIV and/or SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage high-dimensional, multi-scale, and highly heterogeneous genomics data to discover the essential molecular alterations of immune cells introduced by HIV and/or substance use disorder (SUD) at a single-cell resolution. In contrast to existing methods that rely on either transcriptome or epigenome only, this work assumes that several key transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network alterations jointly occur with HIV and/or SUD, resulting in immune system dysfunction. Hence, we propose a computational framework to depict the comprehensive immune cell regulome, construct molecular networks of various cell types, and pinpoint key immune dysfunction driver events at a single-cell resolution.","A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder",10214582,R01DA051906,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hi-C', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humoral Immunities', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural Immunity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Psychological Transfer', 'PubMed', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data hub', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'immune system function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health emergency', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'web services']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,572929
"HIV/ART, low birth weight, and mortality in HIV-exposed uninfected children: a translational mechanistic study Abstract Despite the rapid scale-up of lifelong triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women living with HIV (WLH), children born to WLH continue to have an increased risk of low birth weight (LBW), morbidity, and mortality compared to infants born to women who are not living with HIV. Although the association between LBW and decreased child survival has been well studied, the biological mechanisms linking HIV or ART and LBW are not well described. To better understand how HIV/ART increases the risk of LBW, we leverage an ongoing, well-characterized cohort of women living with HIV enrolled in a trial of data-driven continuous quality intervention to improve long term outcomes of ART in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; our specific focus is on HIV-associated inflammation, immune activation, and microbial communities in the context of universal ART. A cohort of 600 women living with HIV on ART and 600 HIV-negative control along with their HIV-exposed un-infected (HEU) and HIV unexposed (HU) infants will be recruited and followed up through delivery and up to 12 months postpartum to determine how HIV/ART-induced placental dysfunction (Aim 1) or microbial dysbiosis (Aim 2) modulate the risk of LBW and subsequent infant mortality. Using biological specimen obtained from those women, we will document histopathologic placental abnormalities (e.g. necrosis) and measure levels of markers of inflammation, immune activation, and microbial translocation. We will also use a cutting-edge microbiome and virome toolkit with machine learning and ecosystem modeling approaches to evaluate associations between these entities and inflammation and LBW, as well as in silico test myriad mechanistic hypotheses derived from functional analyses. We expect that completion of these complementary aims will provide insight into the biological mechanism(s) associated with increased risk of LBW among HIV-exposed infants. This insight could ultimately identify an optimal HIV- treatment or care modality for pregnant WLH: one which promotes maternal health, prevents HIV mother-to-child transmission, and maximizes infant survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV-infected women have a greater prevalence of low birth weight infants than HIV-uninfected women. We expect that a greater understanding of the mechanism of low birth weight among WLHIV on ART will lead to improved birth outcomes.","HIV/ART, low birth weight, and mortality in HIV-exposed uninfected children: a translational mechanistic study",10258233,R01HD105526,"['Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Ecosystem', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV therapy', 'HIV-exposed uninfected infant', 'Health', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypertension', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Health', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Metagenomics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mother-to-child HIV transmission', 'Necrosis', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spottings', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Woman', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cohort', 'dysbiosis', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'immune activation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal therapy', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'scale up', 'therapy development', 'transmission process', 'vaginal infection', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota', 'virome']",NICHD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,772373
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis",10189504,R01AI143453,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asia', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cryptococcal Meningitis', 'Cryptococcosis', 'Cryptococcus', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Encapsulated', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glucans', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Meningitis', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morphology', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Solid', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'antigen test', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'beta-Glucans', 'differential expression', 'fungus', 'global health', 'glucuronoxylomannan', 'high risk', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immune reconstitution', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'insight', 'interest', 'laminaran', 'microbial', 'mind control', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'natural antibodies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,709959
"The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cities account for a large proportion of the global population of people living with HIV. As a result, Cities have become the focus of UNAIDS's “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic through targeted scale-up of prevention and testing services. In the United States, HIV surveillance data indicates a shifting composition of the population of people newly infected with HIV, with females and minority populations accounting for disproportionate rates of infection. These emerging health disparities in HIV incidence suggest that the largely successful “Getting to Zero” public health initiatives (e.g. rapid expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], needle exchange and safe injecting sites, etc.) are not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging routinely collected surveillance data paired with primary data collection, the major goal of this research is to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection in Fast Track cities, using San Francisco as a test case. This proposal seeks to provide multidisciplinary methodological and theoretical training to investigate the scientific knowledge gap of ongoing HIV transmission in the era of “Getting to Zero.” The proposed training areas are: (1) semi-parametric statistical modeling and machine learning in order to improve the accuracy and precision of population size estimation methods; (2) molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic techniques to assess the relatedness of HIV viral sequences between individuals, inferring a shared source of infection; and (3) minority stress theory to measure the (socio-structural) characteristics of the environment and relate these structural exposures to disparities in HIV infection. Aligned with the training components, the research goals of this study are to: (a) estimate how many people are living with HIV in San Francisco and quantify the magnitude of disparities in infection rates and access to health care services; (b) identify the sociodemographic correlates of membership to a transmission cluster; and (c) identify the socio-structural facilitators of recent HIV infections, particularly among minority populations, using a case-control study design. The evidence generated from this work could have a direct impact on San Francisco's Getting to Zero campaign and inform novel intervention targets for other Fast Track cities. Additionally, the exceptional methodological and practical experience gained from this project will position the candidate for an impactful career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cities account for a large proportion of HIV prevalence and incidence, and therefore are the focus of UNAIDS' “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic. Several “Fast Track Cities”, including San Francisco, CA, have achieved significant reductions in new HIV infections, and yet despite this success racial/ethnic and gender disparities in new infections are emerging. The proposed study will use semi-parametric statistical modeling and HIV phylogenetics applied to routinely collected public health surveillance data, paired with primary data collection informed by a minority stress theoretical framework, to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection and offer novel targets for intervention to achieve zero new infections.",The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination,10105283,K01AI145572,"['Accounting', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'African American', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infection', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Needle Sharing', 'Needle-Exchange Programs', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sizes', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universal Coverage', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antibody test', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'diverse data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender disparity', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'housing instability', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevention service', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'scale up', 'semiparametric', 'sex', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social epidemiology', 'social stigma', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'testing services', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2021,135824
"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP.

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,10135718,U01HL146201,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Baltimore', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'District of Columbia', 'Echocardiography', 'Endocrine', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver diseases', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Time', 'Viral load measurement', 'Walkers', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Interagency HIV Study', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'adjudication', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data management', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'men&apos', 's group', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'synergism']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,169039
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env.

"Developing a risk assessment tool to identify HIV-uninfected adolescent girls and young women at highest risk for HIV infection: a key step for targeted biomedical HIV prevention PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) 15-24 years of age remain at epicenter of the HIV epidemic, with more than 270,000 new HIV infections each year. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies like tenofovir-based oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are promising measures for reducing HIV acquisition in AGYW. However, providing PrEP to all 100 million AGYW in SSA is not feasible, economical, or necessary, as the risk of HIV acquisition among AGYW is not uniformly high. Risk assessment tools are needed to identify those AGYW sub-populations at greatest risk for acquiring HIV in order to support targeted PrEP program implementation. Existing risk assessment tools for HIV incidence in AGYW have had important limitations surrounding feasibility, validity, and generalizability. The primary goal of this project is to develop a regional risk assessment tool for AGYW that is feasible to implement, valid, and generalizable. Our overarching premise is that risk of HIV acquisition among AGYW is not uniform and it is possible to identify high risk AGYW at a regional level. Aims and Methods: Using nationally representative data from 13 African countries collected as part of the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) initiative, our team will address this premise through three specific aims. In the first aim, we will explore risk factors associated with recent HIV infection, a marker of incident HIV, among AGYW. Recent infection is defined in the PHIA data using a well-established testing algorithm. Using data from 13 PHIA surveys from 2015-2019, which include >50,000 observations, individual, structural, household, and epidemiologic predictors of recent HIV infection among AGYW will be identified. In the second aim, we will use the candidate predictors from the first aim to develop and internally validate a risk assessment tool to identify AGYW at highest risk of HIV acquisition. In the third aim, we will externally validate the risk assessment tool in five second-round PHIA surveys from 2020. Team: The team, led by an early-career Principal Investigator, has expertise in HIV prevention for AGYW, biomedical HIV prevention, risk score development, and advanced methods for complex survey data. The team is supported by a technical advisory panel of experts from multiple SSA regions. Expected Impact: These findings will provide an in-depth understanding of the current transmission dynamics of HIV among AGYW in SSA. At the end of the study, we expect to have a validated clinical risk assessment tool that can be applied to a range of SSA settings. Such a tool has the potential to transform the clinical delivery of PrEP and other biomedical HIV prevention strategies in SSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young women 15-24 years old are at high risk for HIV acquisition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tenofovir-based oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising intervention for reducing HIV acquisition in this group, but it is not feasible, economical, or necessary to provide PrEP to all 100 million young women in the region.

"The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV ABSTRACT For the first time on a national level, we propose to utilize routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa in a way that is uniquely robust to transfer across facilities. South Africa is home to more people living with HIV than any other country, and nearly one in three pregnant women attending antenatal care is living with HIV. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased substantially since the start of the national ART program in 2004, with >95% ART coverage during pregnancy and delivery, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV greatly reduced. However, our work has demonstrated that women who initiate ART during pregnancy are at heightened risk of dropping out of care, particularly after delivery, leading to the potential for viral transmission, morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to evaluate the success of policies of expanded access to ART care, and assess continuity of care, due to the lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. In addition, patient movement between unlinked facilities means that self-transfer often is misclassified as loss to care. To address this major shortcoming, our team at the Health Economics and Epidemiology Office (HE2RO) partnered with the South African National Health Laboratory Services in 2015 to use existing HIV-related laboratory data to create the South African National HIV Cohort. Now, through this five-year award, we propose to expand this successful project to use routinely- collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. We propose three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate a novel national cohort of pregnant women accessing HIV care. Using laboratory test data matched to facility type, we will identify entry to antenatal care to build the cohort, then describe key treatment milestones, including 1) engagement in antenatal care, 2) initiation of ART, 3) HIV viremia, and 4) continuity of HIV care in the postpartum period. Second, we will measure the effect of system-wide factors impacting continuity of care among pregnant women. We will assess policies of expanded treatment access on continuity of care using regression-discontinuity analyses. We then will assess mobility and its effect on continuity of care during and after pregnancy. Third, we will identify individual-level risk factors for loss from HIV care in order to develop targeted interventions to improve engagement in HIV care.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Women who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy in South Africa are at high risk of dropping out of care – particularly after delivery – but efforts to evaluate continuity of HIV care among pregnant and postpartum women have been hampered by lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. Through this five-year award, we propose to use routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a national cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa that is uniquely robust to patient transfer. This novel cohort of pregnant women will be a powerful tool available to policymakers, clinicians and researchers for improving our understanding of engagement in care among pregnant women in South Africa and assessing the performance of the South African national ART program in caring for pregnant women living with HIV.",The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV,10137991,R01HD103466,"['Address', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Feeding', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'High Risk Woman', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mother-to-child HIV transmission', 'Movement', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Public Sector', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'antenatal care', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cohort', 'data tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient mobility', 'postpartum care', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NICHD,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",R01,2021,192470
"Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH) PROJECT ABSTRACT Several studies (ASPIRE, VOICE) have shown that adherence is paramount to the success of HIV prevention methods in women. Providing women with options through alternative drug delivery technologies can positively impact adherence. A compelling strategy includes co-delivery of an anti-HIV agent with a contraceptive agent to prevent pregnancy. This proposal plans to develop a next generation multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) film platform for once a month intravaginal administration of the 4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) prodrug (EFdA-P) and a progestin (levonorgestrel (LNG) or etonogestrel (ENG)) to achieve the dual goal of preventing HIV infection and pregnancy. EFdA-P showed increased bioavailability and tissue permeability compared to the parent EFdA, a highly potent exciting new antiviral drug. This versatile extended release MPT film platform is intended to provide a discrete, low cost and convenient alternative to women at high risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Recent data from our lab shows that films can deliver an anti-HIV agent in the vagina for up to 1 month even in the context of menses and sexual intercourse. Using this knowledge and our expertise in the development of intravaginal films, this proposal will develop a film platform for co-delivery of a progestin (licensed contraceptive agent) and EFdA-P at a predetermined rate for at least 1 month. MPT films containing EFdA will also be generated for comparison. The R61 phase of this milestone driven proposal will generate critical preformulation data for EFdA/EFdA-P and LNG/ENG drug combinations and optimize the MPT film formulation to achieve one- month delivery of both drugs with desired short-term stability. This phase will also establish the compatibility of film prototype with vaginal tissue and microbial flora in vitro followed by vaginal retention studies in the non- human primate (NHP) model. The R61 phase will demonstrate the ability of the MPT film prototype to attain desired release profiles of both drugs in vivo (NHP model). Using a clearly defined go / no go criteria, a lead MPT film will be transitioned to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will involve IND-enabling activities including drug- drug interaction, in vitro transporter and metabolism studies, manufacturing scale up and establishing long-term stability of the lead MPT film. It will also demonstrate the safety (rat, rabbit, and NHP) and efficacy of the lead MPT film against SHIV infection in NHP model. It will also confirm the ability of the film to function in the context of sexual activity and its ability to deliver contraceptive levels of progestin in the NHP model. The successful completion of proposed work will generate a novel extended release MPT film platform that can be applied to other drug combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The adherence of women to anti-HIV and contraceptives can be improved by providing convenient low-cost alternative product options. This project will develop novel extended release vaginal films that co-deliver anti- HIV and contraceptive agents for one month upon single intravaginal administration.",Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH),10085198,R61AI142687,"['2&apos', '-deoxyadenosine', 'AIDS prevention', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Biological Availability', 'Cervical', 'Coitus', 'Contraceptive Agents', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dosage Forms', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Epithelial', 'Etonogestrel', 'Female', 'Film', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV drug resistance', 'HIV therapy', 'High Risk Woman', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intravaginal Administration', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Levonorgestrel', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mediating', 'Menstruation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nucleosides', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Parents', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prodrugs', 'Progestins', 'Rattus', 'Resistance profile', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'SIV', 'Safety', 'Sex Behavior', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Vagina', 'Vendor', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'condoms', 'contraceptive efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'drug release profile', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'microbiota', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'physical property', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'reproductive tract', 'research clinical testing', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety testing', 'simian human immunodeficiency virus', 'success', 'unintended pregnancy', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R61,2021,1295960
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,10112810,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'perinatal HIV', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,188938
"North American AIDS Cohorts on Collaboration and Design (NAACCORD) The North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) has represented Region 1 of the leDEA initiative since 2006. The 23 single and multi-site clinical and classical epidemiologic HIV cohorts of the NA-ACCORD encompass most HIV cohorts within the US and Canada. Over 100 sites contribute data collected from over 190,000 people with HIV (PWH). We have established a strong collaborative infrastructure that capitalizes on the talents and expertise of a multi-disciplinary group of investigators that span basic science, clinical research, epidemiology, data informatics and biostatistics. We have been highly productive in addressing our previous Aims and key questions in contemporary care and public health relevant to adult PWH. Our strengths are especially relevant to the goals of the US DHHS Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, uniquely providing the broad geographic and demographic scope, established scientific platform, large sample size, extensive longitudinal follow-up of >1.3 million person-years, and depth of clinical data to inform the goals of EHE with rich data on those who will continue to survive with HIV after transmission is halted. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on HIV outcomes and trends in HIV indicators, as well as longer-term outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH, can be answered in the NA-ACCORD. Within this context, we present three broadly-defined aims for the next funding cycle: Aim 1: Characterize the longitudinal course of HIV treatment, progression and outcomes in North America in the setting of the EHE initiative, which will increase the number and heterogeneity of those in HIV care as HIV treatment and the long-term challenges of living with HIV continue to evolve. Aim 2: To assess and characterize the clinical course of HIV infection in North America, with a focus on major non-AIDS comorbidities and co-infections, multimorbidity and comorbidity- free life expectancy. Aim 3: To expand and extend our state-of-the art epidemiologic, biostatistical, and data science methodologic approaches. The NA-ACCORD is a world-class collaboration of established HIV cohorts well-positioned to a) provide in-depth understanding of the longitudinal course of HIV when extraordinary efforts are being made to EHE; b) collaborate with the other IeDEA regions to inform the future HIV epidemics in low- and middle-income regions; and c) understand differences in HIV treatment, outcomes and prognostic factors that will inform future research and HIV care globally. The NA-ACCORD is the most wide-ranging and in-depth collaboration of HIV cohorts that exists within North America. Its large sample size, the comprehensiveness and quality of its data, combined with the expert use of state-of-the-art statistical methods will allow us to provide answers to the most pressing questions of contemporary importance for the care and outcomes of people with HIV in the US and Canada. The questions will inform the End the HIV Epidemic initiative and provide important information on the long-term course of HIV disease.",North American AIDS Cohorts on Collaboration and Design (NAACCORD),10236657,U01AI069918,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biometry', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liver diseases', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhoods', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Polypharmacy', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Viral', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical research site', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data visualization', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'longitudinal course', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'social health determinants', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,323564
"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,10107795,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'comorbidity', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'vascular injury', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,648591
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment. Capitalizing on existing datasets, this project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments in active drug users.",MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications,10086974,R01DA045565,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'cocaine use', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'connectome data', 'daily functioning', 'data fusion', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'denoising', 'executive function', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non-drug', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention service', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'service delivery', 'sound', 'stimulant use', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,415066
"Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV Many HIV vaccine candidates have failed clinical trials, as they were unable to elicit a potent and durable response to HIV viral challenge. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified in a number of HIV+ individuals with well-controlled viral levels, and these bnAbs target epitopes that contain residues that are relatively conserved across viral strains. It is thought bnAbs may have efficacy against various strains of HIV pathogen. It is therefore widely believed that systems which induce a potent immune response that includes the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) in humans could be effective HIV vaccines, and help to mitigate the wide genetic diversity in envelope proteins and relatively high mutation rate of HIV. However, developing a vaccine which can elicit the production of these bnAbs in vivo has proven to be extremely challenging. This is likely due to the complex affinity maturation process that is required to produce bnAbs. Immunization protocols typically administer a single dose of antigen (prime dose), which is sometimes followed by a “boost” dose delivered several weeks later. In a traditional bolus immunization, the half-life of the antigen present in lymph nodes is generally shorter than the time scale over which germinal centres start producing higher affinity IgG antibodies relative to the initial IgM response (~18 hrs). In contrast, natural infections expose the immune system to escalating antigen and inflammation over days to weeks, resulting in the formation of a germinal centre with dynamic antigen presentation. This germinal centre niche also supports activation of antigen presenting cells, T follicular helper cells, and appropriate cytokine signalling to generate bnAbs. It is likely that to develop effective bnAbs, sophisticated vaccination techniques which can more closely mimic natural infections and natural bnAb formation may be required. We believe that to develop a successful HIV vaccine, researchers must aim to engineer more sophisticated and biomimetic vaccines. Bioengineered vaccines should therefore consider three key parameters in parallel; 1) delivery of an appropriately selected antigen, with 2) favourable kinetics of antigen expression, and 3) control of the immune response in the germinal centre. We believe lymph node targeted delivery of computationally designed mRNA antigens inside immunostimulatory lipid nanoparticles (mRNA LNPs) administered with computationally optimized immunization protocols will address these three aspects in a unique way. Additionally,Translate Bio will provide expertise in manufacturing considerations for mRNA therapeutics. As modifications to mRNA structure may impact the mRNA antigen translation, stability, and immunogenicity, the input of our translational partner (Translate Bio) will allow us to develop vaccines with a potential avenue for commercial development. This R61/R33 proposal combines our expertise in computational antigen design, HIV immunology, combinatorial chemistry, and the commercialisation of mRNA therapeutics to develop a new class of HIV mRNA vaccine candidates. HIV remains a global pandemic with no effective vaccine. Here we propose to combine computational and experimental methods to develop an mRNA nanovaccine which produces broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV, by engineering antigen composition, mRNA structure, and immunostimulating mRNA nanoformulations for enhanced immunity.",Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV,10237019,R61AI161805,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Belief', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Bolus Infusion', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV', 'HIV Antigens', 'HIV vaccine', 'HIV-1', 'HLA-A gene', 'Half-Life', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunologic Tests', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA vaccine', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'adoptive B cell transfer', 'cell behavior', 'clinical development', 'clinical translation', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'efficacy validation', 'env Gene Products', 'humanized mouse', 'immune activation', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'lipid nanoparticle', 'lymph nodes', 'mRNA delivery', 'models and simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'nanoformulation', 'nanoparticle delivery', 'nanotherapeutic', 'nanovaccine', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'response', 'targeted delivery', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R61,2021,568747
"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease. The proposed studies focus on understanding how aging and HIV infection affect the function of the immune system, particularly in response to influenza vaccination, to identify cell types and biologic pathways that are potential targets for the development of treatments to improve immune function.",The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response,10183118,R01AG055362,"['20 year old', '21 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antibodies', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cell Count', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Family member', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV-1', 'Head', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Interleukin 7 Receptor', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toll-like receptors', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Whole Blood', 'age effect', 'analytical method', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immune system function', 'immunosenescence', 'improved', 'inflammatory milieu', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'innate immune function', 'insight', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'receptor function', 'recruit', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine response', 'young adult']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,779116
"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Title Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Abstract (30 Lines)  HIV testing jumpstarts the HIV prevention and treatment care continuum. HIV testing levels in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in diverse settings like Malaysia are especially low. MSM increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM has soared to 21.6% in Malaysia, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that lifetime HIV testing is 70.3%, past-year testing is 40.9% and only 9.5% were tested more than once-yearly despite extraordinary levels of self-reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in these settings are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model of behavioral change is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality and providing real-time information, motivation and behavioral skills to overcome barriers. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using smartphone apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence using machine learning (AI/ML) may overcome such limitations, but have yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test to assess acceptability and feasibility of an AI/ML-Chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual (control). Findings from this exploratory pilot study will inform a future prospective Type 1 Hybrid implementation science trial. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that adapts using machine learning and artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (TestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create a mHealth intervention for MSM to promote real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. TestBot will provide culturally-tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain the intervention.",Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing,10194372,R21AI152927,"['AIDS prevention', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Community Networks', 'Computer Systems', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemic', 'Facebook', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysian', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Peru', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Same-sex', 'Sauna', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexual Transmission', 'Social Network', 'South Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'criminal behavior', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'health management', 'high risk men', 'humiliation', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'next generation', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prospective', 'response', 'same sex behavior', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social stigma', 'sodomy', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,189468
"Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework SUMMARY Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention and intervention strategies designed to reduce significantly both prevalence and incidence worldwide. In order to achieve the 2020 UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal (90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed to be on sustained antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to maintain viral suppression), it is necessary to develop innovative tools that can be used for predicting the growth and trajectory of localized sub-epidemics driven by specific transmission clusters. Phylodynamic analysis has extensively been used in the HIV field to track the origin and reconstruct the virus demographic history both at local, regional and global level. However, such studies have been so far only retrospective, with little or no power to make predictions about future epidemic trends. The overarching goal of the prosed project is to develop an innovative computational framework coupling phylodynamic inference and behavioral network data with artificial intelligence algorithms capable of predicting HIV transmission clusters future trajectory, and informing on key determinants of new infections. We propose to achieve this goal by carrying out three specific aims: 1. Develop a phylodynamic-based PRIDE module to forecast HIV infection hotspots [the infected]; 2. Develop a behavioral network-based PRIDE module for risk of HIV infection [the uninfected], and 3. Carry out focus groups for deploying the new PRIDE forecasting technology into public health, and implement prevention through the peer change agent model. In particular, through a close partnership with the Florida Department of Health (FLDoH), we will analyze existing databases that the FLDoH has assembled over the past twelve years including extensive HIV molecular sequence, clinical and behavioral network data. Florida had an HIV case rate of 24.0 per 100,000 people in 2016, and it is currently the third state in the USA in terms of yearly incidence. Our partnership with the FLDoH will ensure that the results of the proposed research will be used to curtail the HIV epidemic by optimizing public health based surveillance programs, informing targeted intervention strategies, and implementing more effective prevention measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention strategies designed to reduce significantly incidence worldwide. Integrated statewide surveillance programs have been generating and linking big amasses of molecular, demographic, and clinical data. Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with molecular epidemiology tools can exploit these complex data to generate accurate predictions on epidemic spread that can be used to identify actionable sociodemographic factors guiding precision public health intervention.",Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework,10155407,R01AI145552,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation Reports', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'complex data', 'computer framework', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'working group']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,705136
"uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the U.S. Substance use is an important influence on HIV risk among GBMSM; and partner seeking for both sex and substance use have largely moved online and to geosocial networking platforms designed for GBMSM (e.g., Grindr). Technological advances in the collection and mining of “big data” to inform behavioral health interventions have increased in recent years but have not been applied directly to HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction among GBMSM. At the same time, despite major advances in biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and substance use harm-reduction (i.e., medication assisted therapy [MAT]), these strategies are underutilized by GBMSM. My research team and I conducted formative research on social media data mining and machine learning through a NIDA A/START (R03) to identify patterns of technology use that are associated with HIV risk and substance use among GBMSM. We established computational functionality of a culturally tailored social media data mining program among substance using GBMSM. I now take an important scientific risk to use this technology to develop an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM, tentatively titled uTECH, that leverages insights from machine learning to trigger personalized intervention content in order to increase biomedical HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, I propose to conduct a two-phase study. In Phase 1 I will conduct qualitative interviews with GBMSM to inform the iterative development and refinement of uTECH. In Phase 2, I will test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of uTECH in a comparative implementation science trial. For this phase, I will (a) enroll racially diverse, HIV- negative, substance using GBMSM; (b) randomize them to either the uTECH intervention or a comparison group; and (c) measure acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility through 6 months post-intervention. My primary implementation science outcomes will be acceptability (i.e., Acceptability of Intervention Measure [AIM]), appropriateness (i.e., Intervention Appropriateness Measure [IAM]), and feasibility (i.e., Feasibility of Intervention Measure [FIM]). I believe that the power of “big data” and new technologies can be harnessed for effective HIV prevention with substance using GBMSM. In the era of increasing HIV prevention fatigue among GBMSM, the ability to deliver quick, convenient and highly personalized interventions presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and substance use is an important factor driving new HIV infections in this population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among GBMSM by refining and testing the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of an innovative, social media “big data” machine learning intervention, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies.",uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM,10400487,DP2DA049296,"['AIDS prevention', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bisexual', 'Collection', 'Development', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Gays', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV risk', 'Harm Reduction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'behavioral health intervention', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'data mining', 'design', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men who have sex with men', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'post intervention', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social media', 'transmission process']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2021,13728
"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed.

"Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) Approach to Understanding the Biology Underlying HIV and Drug Abuse. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed study is to advance our understanding of the complex networks of biology underlying variation in HIV viral load (VL) and latent reservoir (LR) among HIV+ individuals, and how cocaine abuse (CA) affects identified biological networks. With the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and public health strategies to reduce HIV incidence, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Managing HIV progression (HP) and searching for an HIV cure are of paramount importance. Higher pretreatment VL is associated with HP and is associated with a larger LR. An HIV cure is dependent on eliminating the LR. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to increase VL, worsen HP, slow decline of viral production after cART, and, we hypothesize, affect the quantity of LR. Thus, there is a complex web of relationships among VL, LR, and CA, which are partially driven by and mediated through genetic susceptibility and gene regulation. As concluded by Le Cleric et al. (2019) in their recent review: “Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative bioinformatics approaches.” We propose Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) as a multi-method, multi-omic framework for discovering and understanding the biology underlying HIV outcomes and the effect of CA. We will apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence, network mapping, and Lines-of-Evidence integration to existing genome-, methylome-, and transcriptome-wide data across a number of cohorts in the following aims:   Aim 1: Identify gene networks underlying variation in HIV VL and LR applying GNetii.   Aim 2: Identify differences in HIV associated gene networks by CA.  This robustly designed study is significant and innovative: targeting key HIV outcomes affected by CA,  applying big data techniques to identify gene networks across multiple omics (enhancing discovery and  biological interpretation), and leveraging unique LR data. Our multiple Principal Investigator team includes  expertise in HIV, drug abuse, and computational biology. Thus, we are likely to produce important new  insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease: providing a basis for targeting unique features of CA  that impact VL and LR, which make HIV management and a cure more challenging in this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and public health strategies to reduce new HIV infections, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to worsen HIV progression, even with ART, and is likely to increase the latent reservoir of virus: the latent reservoir blocking efforts for an HIV cure.

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,10086888,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Behavior assessment', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exclusion', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Health', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropathogenesis', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'accurate diagnostics', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease classification', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geriatric neuroHIV', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monocyte', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'prospective', 'sex', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1093727
"Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection from a nearly universal fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, yet associated symptoms like cognitive impairments (CI) persist at a higher rate than in comparable uninfected control populations. These impairments are heterogeneous in terms of presentation (e.g. cognitive domains) and trajectory. Given that domain-specific impairments are likely due to different pathological changes, studies that investigate CI based on a global metric of impairment are likely to miss this. The application of advanced analysis methods, including machine learning to interrogate complex diseases and biological processes, is beginning to transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to complex diseases, including CI in the setting of HIV infection. In order to identify and characterize factors that contribute to nonlinear patterns of cognitive change, we propose to capitalize on over 20 years of data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). MACS is one of the largest and longest running studies of men infected with HIV, that includes a substudy with biannual neurocognitive testing that began in 1988. A complete battery of longitudinal neurocognitive testing data is available to us through this cohort, as well as concurrent datasets that include demographic, clinical, psychiatric, lifestyle and biochemical data. The data set consists of over 3500 subjects with over 500,000 data points. In Aim 1, we propose to use data-driven methods (k-means clustering for joint longitudinal trajectories and dynamic time warping) to identify groups of individuals with distinct domain-specific patterns of cognitive change. In Aim 2, we will use the vast amount of data collected on these subjects to identify subtype-specific variables that contribute or predict group membership. By using advanced machine learning methods that are unconstrained by preset statistical or biological assumptions, we are uniquely positioned to identify factors that contribute to longitudinal patterns of change in specific cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive changes in HIV can be indicative of varying neuropathological mechanisms of impairment. This project aims to shed light on those mechanisms by analyzing pre-existing data from the MACS cohort to identify groups of HIV infected men with similar cognitive trajectories and then mining the available data to identify risk factors and contributing variables to those trajectories.

METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring.

"Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia Project Summary/Abstract:  This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of longitudinal cognitive outcomes among children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s prior research and experience, and will introduce the candidate to new skills that will be shared by the mentorship team led by Dr. Gretchen Birbeck, an expert in neuroepidemiology and clinical trials in resource-limited settings. The proposed training and mentored research will enable the candidate to transition to an independent research career focused on neurologic complications of HIV.  Cognitive impairment is common in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in low-resource settings, affecting up to 50% of perinatally-infected children in Sub-Saharan Africa. In children with HIV receiving Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), opportunistic infections and severe HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy have become less common, but more subtle forms of cognitive impairment have increased in prevalence. The foundation for this proposal is based on research conducted by the candidate as part of the HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) study, in which 208 children and adolescents with HIV and 208 HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited, and clinical risk factors and biomarkers for cognitive impairment were evaluated. In the HANDZ study, we found that serum markers produced by activated platelets and pro- inflammatory monocytes associated with depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, suggesting that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) may be key drivers in HIV-associated cognitive impairment. In the proposed project, the population recruited as part of HANDZ will be followed longitudinally for a total of five years, and an additional HIV-unexposed uninfected control group will be recruited.  The aims of this proposal include 1) To evaluate whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes predict depression and cognitive outcomes in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia 2) To assess whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes are associated with cerebrovascular disease in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV and 3) To develop a comprehensive predictive model of cognitive change in children with HIV incorporating clinical characteristics, plasma biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers. The short- term goal of this application is to 1) Train the applicant through mentored research 2) Identify a subpopulation of children and adolescents with HIV at high risk of cognitive decline and 3) From clinical profiles, plasma biomarkers and imaging characteristics, identify factors associated with the greatest effect on cognitive outcomes that can be targeted in future intervention studies. The long-term impact will include setting the stage for clinical trials of interventions to prevent or treat HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in children and adolescents. Project Narrative As a consequence of the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV in children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is evolving from a universally fatal illness into a chronic condition, often complicated by comorbidities including depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. However, there are few longitudinal studies assessing these comorbidities in children and adolescents in low-resource settings. This prospective study of Zambian children and adolescents will identify risk factors and biomarkers for HIV- associated comorbidities that will set the stage for future clinical trials.",Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia,10162679,K23NS117310,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Encephalopathies', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Encephalopathy', 'HIV-associated cognitive impairment', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Serum Markers', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Zambia', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'clinical trial readiness', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune activation', 'improved', 'insight', 'monocyte', 'nanoformulation', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'subclinical depression', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K23,2021,191445
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,10171835,R01DA047820,"['Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Association Learning', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Methylation', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Veterans', 'Women&apos', 's Interagency HIV Study', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cocaine use', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'feature selection', 'frailty', 'immune function', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'painful neuropathy', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'substance misuse', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,570656
"THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT Project Summary/Abstract Although HIV-infected patients in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population, they are at a significantly elevated risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Such disorders are the most common neurological complication of HIV disease, with prevalence estimates ranging from 35-70% of all HIV-infected patients, and research targeting such comorbidities has been identified as a top priority by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137). While the mechanisms that underlie HAND are not well understood, numerous human neuroimaging studies have examined the brain regions that may be involved, and overall these studies have been largely successful in identifying the critical hubs and large-scale networks. However, many questions remain regarding basic circuit dysfunction within these brain regions, and consequently there is a clear and common need to further investigate the key physiological parameters that may underlie the development and progression of HAND, especially in the context of aging. It is well known that human cortical neurons exhibit spontaneous firing in the absence of incoming exogenous and endogenous input. Across a neuronal population, these discharges summate with local dendritic currents and synaptic potentials to produce cortical rhythmic activity, which is often referred to as “spontaneous activity.” Such spontaneous rhythms are ubiquitous throughout the human brain, but their role in modulating cognition is only beginning to be understood. Recently, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to show that the strength of spontaneous activity directly affects neural oscillatory activity in the same cortical area, and in-turn modulates real time task performance in controls and HIV-infected adults. Additionally, we have shown that spontaneous activity in multiple brain regions increases with advancing age, that this increase is deleterious to performance, and that these effects are accentuated in patients with HAND. In fact, our preliminary data suggests that the level of spontaneous activity in specific brain regions may distinguish age-matched HIV-infected patients with and without HAND. In this project, we will quantify the trajectory of age-related elevations in spontaneous cortical activity in a large group of HIV-infected adults and demographically-matched controls. We will then evaluate how the strength of such spontaneous activity affects local neural oscillations and real time cognitive performance. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that spontaneous activity will increase with age in both groups, and that the slope of this increase will be steeper in HIV-infected adults relative to controls, and further accentuated in those with HAND. Importantly, we also hypothesize that these increases will be associated with proportional changes in the strength of the neural oscillations underlying cognition, and behavioral performance indices such as accuracy and reaction time. Finally, in Aim 3, we will utilize deep learning methods to classify our sample into groups based on the neurophysiological metrics derived from MEG, with the gold standard being their overall neuropsychological profile. Project Narrative HIV-infection has become a chronic manageable condition with a life expectancy that approaches that of the general population, but affected patients remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive disorders. Previous neuroimaging studies have mapped the brain regions that may be involved in these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders(HAND), and while these studies have been largely successful, many questions persist about the inherent physiology in these regions, and how it might differ in patients with HAND. In the current study, we use an advanced dynamic functional brain mapping approach to evaluate the role of two novel neurophysiological parameters, previously shown to be implicated in aging, in the pathophysiology of HAND.",THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT,10321801,R01MH116782,"['AIDS dementia', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Task Performances', 'Terminal Disease', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Visual Cortex', 'Western World', 'age related', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'electric field', 'healthy aging', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'somatosensory']",NIMH,FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' HOME,R01,2021,518570
"Patterns and predictors of viral suppression: A Big Data approach Abstract Viral suppression is the final stage of the HIV treatment cascade, which serves as the framework for UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals. Sustained viral suppression is one of four strategic areas of the “Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE): A Plan for America” federal campaign, launched in February 2019, which aims for the reduction of new HIV infections in the United States (US) by 75% and 90% by 2025 and 2030, respectively. The EtHE campaign focuses on 48 US counties and 7 states, including South Carolina (SC). Given the importance of viral suppression in ending the US HIV epidemic, an optimal predictive model of viral status can help clinicians identify those at risk of poor viral control and inform clinical improvements in HIV treatment and care. Various indicators to characterize the longitudinal virologic outcomes have been proposed in the literature such as sustained viral suppression, viral rebound, low-level viraemia (LLV), persistent LLV, and virologic blips. However, some critical gaps still exist in our efforts to develop an optimal predictive model of viral suppression. These gaps include the use of limited indicators of virologic outcomes, limited duration of follow-up, limited data sources, lack of consideration of structural and socioenvironmental data, small or unrepresentative samples of people living with HIV (PLWH), and limited efforts to translate research findings into service-ready tools for clinical use. With NIH support (R01AI127203) since 2017, we have utilized a Big Data approach to examine treatment gaps (e.g., missed opportunities for diagnosis and linkage to care) among a statewide cohort of PLWH in SC. This ongoing research extracted longitudinal electronic health records data from six state agencies and then linked the patient-level data with county-level data (e.g., socioeconomic indicators, number of health care professionals, hospitals, and health care facilities) from multiple publicly available data sources. The resultant integrated database has enabled us to successfully “track” 11,470 patients who were diagnosed with HIV from 2005 to 2016 in SC and identify the gaps in HIV treatment linkage and retention. Based on the experience and accomplishment of the R01AI127203, we submit this application to examine the longitudinal dynamic pattern of viral suppression, develop optimal predictive models of various viral suppression indicators, and translate the models to service-ready tools for clinical use. In the proposed research, we will: 1) continue to “follow” our cohort for another five years (and also expand the cohort by adding PLWH diagnosed between 2016-2020); 2) expand our database to include additional data on critical predictors of viral suppression (e.g., treatment and laboratory data, alcohol and substance use data) from two newly participating statewide data sources; 3) employ artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling to understand the dynamic viral load patterns and their predictors; and 4) develop and pilot-test a multifactorial decision system for clinical use. The results will enable the identification of PLWH with poor viral control and suggest “when” and “how” to help those PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of viral suppression and inform tailored HIV care management among PLWH in SC and beyond. Project Narrative The overall goal of the proposed research is to integrate individual-level data from eight state agencies and county-level data from multiple open data sources and develop a prediction model for multiple viral load indicators through AI-based modeling, accounting for factors at the individual level, structural level, and socioenvironmental level among people living with HIV (PLWH) in South Carolina. The results will enable the identification of PLWH with poor viral control and further inform healthcare providers of “when” and “how” to help those PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of viral suppression and inform effective HIV control strategies towards the goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the US.",Patterns and predictors of viral suppression: A Big Data approach,10321732,R01AI164947,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Environment', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Visit', 'alcohol and other drug', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'immune function', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'open data', 'predictive modeling', 'prisma', 'restoration', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'therapy adherence', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'uptake', 'viral rebound', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,717540
