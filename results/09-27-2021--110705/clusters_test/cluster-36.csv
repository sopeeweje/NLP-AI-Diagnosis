"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,10113656,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,397125
"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA. The results of this research are also likely to be relevant to other autoimmune diseases.",Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis,10208711,R01AR063611,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chronic small plaque psoriasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'RNA', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Suggestion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'differential expression', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory CD4 T lymphocyte', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'predictive marker', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'systemic autoimmunity', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,608486
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,10129203,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,336445
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical trial implementation', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,508845
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10261436,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2021,1069526
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"Integrative analysis of genomics and imaging data from the BRAIN Initiative and other public data sources Constructing an integrated picture of human brain function requires understanding how the effects of molecular and genetic factors propagate upwards, through many intervening layers of structure and interaction, to influence behavioral, psychiatric and cognitive traits. Projects such as the BRAIN Initiative (BI) recognize that building such a picture requires the convergent efforts of experts across genetics, genomics, neuroscience, and clinical studies, and have created resources to aid the integration of data from these disciplines. However, the challenge of combining experimental methods and theoretical models spanning vast length/time scales remains significant. One of the more promising avenues of addressing this challenge is the use of interpretable deep-learning approaches to learn high-dimensional structure inherent in data. By embedding constraints from known biological structure, investigators can relate the models’ internal representations to identifiable factors from neuroscience. This proposal will draw on the extensive resources in BI archives, along with other public resources, to integrate data from genetics, functional genomics, and neuroimaging. Through secondary analysis on this data we will build deep, multilevel polygenic models of high-level traits, such as cognitive, affective and psychiatric traits. We will trace the mechanisms underlying such traits to specific regions, cell types, functional connectivity patterns and structural imaging features. Additionally, by embedding biological structure at intermediate levels (tissue and cell-type gene regulatory networks; structural/functional constraints from MRI data), we will build models that improve on additive heritability measures of polygenic risk. In the process, we will harmonize BI data with other publicly available brain omics and imaging datasets. We will deposit all resources and models into relevant BI archives. The proposal is framed as follows. First, we will combine genetics with genomics-based networks from multiple brain regions and cell types, and develop predictive models of region- and cell-type-specific omics variation. These will be included in an interpretable deep model of cognitive and psychiatric traits (Aim 1). Second, we will learn predictive models of structural and functional imaging features from genetic predictors, which will likewise be embedded in interpretable deep models of high-level traits (Aim 2). Third, an integrated, polygenic model will be built by combining both functional-genomics- and neuroimaging-based features, allowing the impact of both subcomponents to be assessed. Furthermore, we will extend our previous work to develop compression-based interpretability methods, which allow a network to be coarse-grained and interpreted at varying levels of resolution. Such interpretation will include the exploration of subphenotypic structure in psychiatric disorders and interactions between traits (Aim 3). We expect the proposed approach to have wide-ranging implications, including insights into mechanistic underpinnings of brain function, new frameworks for integrative multilevel analysis, and the development of methods and resources for future research. Although cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric traits all exhibit substantial amounts of heritability, knowledge of the mechanisms by which genetic variation is linked to such traits remains limited, partly because of the difficulty in building models reflecting the many levels of structure in the human brain across which genetic variation is filtered. We propose to develop an interpretable deep-learning framework to allow data across genetics, functional genomics, and neuroimaging domains to be combined in learning deep, multilevel polygenic models of high-level traits, while harmonizing data across BRAIN Initiative and other large-scale resources. Our predictive modeling framework will embed known and learned biological structural constraints, and permit investigators to relate the models’ internal representations to desired levels of analysis, by developing network-compression based coarse-graining and interpretability methods.",Integrative analysis of genomics and imaging data from the BRAIN Initiative and other public data sources,10190025,RF1MH123245,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deposition', 'Discipline', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobank', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'model building', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'repository', 'secondary analysis', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,1309909
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",10177978,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2021,744955
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750
"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake.

"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadmium', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome 22', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early treatment', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metabolic', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Urine', 'Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority communities', 'multidisciplinary', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'podocyte', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'socioeconomics', 'targeted treatment', 'urinary', 'walkability']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,775497
"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites,10212798,U01HG011717,"['Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Creatine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Funding', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heredity', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Jamaican', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lipids', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'North America', 'Northern Africa', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'lifestyle data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'prevent', 'tool', 'trait', 'working group']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2021,958531
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,10160842,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine self-administration', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2021,3009655
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,530499
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults.

"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,10147906,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Floods', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Explosions', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'stem', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,417279
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,10206145,R01HD107493,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'supplemental oxygen']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,640901
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases. In this proposal, we will develop novel deep learning approaches to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development and apply the methods to orofacial cleft genetic data.",Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development,10235696,R01DE030122,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cleft lip and palate', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'craniofacial tissue', 'data integration', 'de novo mutation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic tools', 'heterogenous data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,585184
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822
"Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This proposal describes a 5-year training program to develop an academic career focused on improving glaucoma risk prediction through a combination of genomic and phenotypic risk. I will use supervised, semi- supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to define novel structural and longitudinal image based endophenotypes for POAG aligned with disease subtype and progression. These endophenotypes will be used to discover new disease associated genomic loci. By including longitudinal data, we aim to identify genetic markers for progressive disease. We will use known POAG risk variants and novel genetic variants identified in these analyses to create several candidate genome wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for POAG. Each candidate PRS with and without addition of demographic and image features will be tested for its utility to predict glaucoma risk is independent NEIGHBORHOOD and LIFE cohorts. We hypothesize that a PRS based on genetic variants associated with our endophenotypes will have improved POAG case predictive power compared to PRS based on cross-sectional genome wide association studies. The proposed studies have the potential to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and improve predictive power of genetic testing  I am well positioned to conduct this research and undertake the training proposed here. I have a strong quantitative science background with a degree in engineering, statistical training and established track records of large database research. Additionally, I have proposed a detailed career development plan that will allow me to 1) learn the fundamentals, applications and limitations of machine learning based approaches for automated fundus image analysis and 2) understand computational biology and statistical approaches to handle large genomics datasets. My training plan includes an MPH in quantitative methods at the HSPH with concentration in computational biology and statistical learning. Additionally, I am supported by a multidisciplinary team of committed mentors dedicated to my academic growth and progression into an independent clinician scientist. I will work with glaucoma genetics experts, Drs Wiggs and Segre, and leaders in statistical and machine learning, Drs Elze and Kalpathy-Cramer. I will have full access to the extensive resources at MEE, Partners Healthcare and the Harvard system for this work and my career development.  The research outlined here will improve our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and lay the foundation for development of multimodal precision medicine approaches for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. This research is cutting edge and prepares me well for my career as an independent NIH funded investigator with the aim to use longitudinal multi-modal clinical, imaging, testing and multi-omics data in multi- ethnic glaucoma patients to 1) understand pathways of vision loss, 2) develop precision medicine approaches to pre-symptomatically identify patients at high risk of functional vision loss and progression and 3) make these technologies a clinical reality in order to reduce the burden of unnecessary blindness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is a progressive, irreversible optic neuropathy with variable presentation and clinical course and we currently lack the ability to pre-symptomatically distinguish patients at risk of severe and progressive disease from those individuals unlikely to develop glaucoma-related vision loss. Using existing data from two large biobanks, this project will use cutting edge machine learning approaches to define POAG phenotypes aligned with disease subtype and progression, use these to discover novel disease related genetic associations, and test their utility for identifying glaucoma cases in independent cohorts.

"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10267762,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2021,588225
"Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD Abstract  This project seeks to further our understanding of the genetic influences on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One approach to increasing sample sizes for molecular genetic studies of MDD and thereby increasing power to detect genetic loci is to assess individuals using surveys that are shorter and more efficient than full clinical assessments. This `minimal phenotyping' leads to identification of risk loci that may not be specific to strictly defined MDD and can be associated with a variety of psychiatric phenotypes. While these discoveries are important to understand the overall biology of complex mental and psychiatric outcomes, they offer little direct and actionable insight into the biological underpinning of strictly defined MDD which shows increased severity, impairment, and recurrence risk and accounts for a disproportionate impact on disability and morbidity in comparison to liberally defined MDD. Recently, large biobanks surveying tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects across hundreds to thousands of variables and EHR records have been become available to the scientific community. Combining rich phenotype data with genome-wide genotyping or sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these resources to advance discovery and understanding of the genetic influences on MDD. One major challenge is the lack of uniform measures that allow assessment of strictly defined MDD, impairment, severity, and recurrence risk. This lack of `deep phenotyping' while pragmatic in allowing the assembly of large samples, creates challenges in accurate determinations of controls, non-specific mild cases, and strictly defined cases. We have previously shown how machine learning (ML) analysis methods can leverage this type of heterogeneous, broad, but light collection of information to predict and quantify risk in subjects not deeply assessed. While there is significant room for improvement in these predictions, the resulting effective sample size and power to detect specific liability loci increased dramatically when this method was applied. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate 2 families of ML methods that can be used to predict unmeasured and specific strictly defined MDD risk. In Aim 2, we propose to use these predictions of risk in genetic association analyses to detect common genetic variation that influences risk specific to strictly defined MDD. Finally, we will make our biobank adapted ML method pipeline available to the broader psychiatric genetics research community which is expected to improve power and loci detection for other psychiatric disorders.   NARRATIVE  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common psychiatric disorder, a leading cause of disability worldwide, and partially influenced by genetics. Rigorous clinical assessments are generally needed for studies to distinguish between genetic loci influencing mild versus debilitating manifestations of the disorder. We propose to evaluate and adapt machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined MDD in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing MDD.",Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD,10196078,R21MH126358,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'biobank', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'psychogenetics', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'statistical and machine learning', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'vector']",NIMH,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2021,208389
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia. Additionally, this research will provide the platform for the career development of a young scientist focused on bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning methods to tackle the dire consequences of AMR.",Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia,10211124,K01AI148593,"['Age', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Body mass index', 'Bypass', 'Carbon', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Central America', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocarditis', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxacillin', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Societies', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'South America', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic signature', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial genomics', 'mortality', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2021,129870
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4).

"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics. This research provides a rigorous framework for investigating relevant mechanisms underlying complex traits, including disease risk and quantitative traits.

"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1465292
"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10207692,R35GM138286,"['Address', 'Aedes', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Insecticides', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,382894
"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Altruism', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Living Donors', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Readiness', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chatbot', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation intervention', 'implementation outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'literacy', 'living kidney donor', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'success', 'transplant centers', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,10161678,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'demented', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,619917
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",10139101,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,341300
