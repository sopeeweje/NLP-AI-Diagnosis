"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,10077788,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoresistance', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2021,192240
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors PROJECT SUMMARY The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity, for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target. The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models. If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells. NARRATIVE Solid tumor recurrence is likely driven by slow dividing or quiescent tumor subpopulations in the primary tumor which survive treatment regimens and give rise to secondary tumors. However, we currently lack a basic understanding of molecular features of these populations and, as a result, do not have effective therapeutic strategies to neutralize them. The experiments described in this proposal are directly relevant to public health because they will identify and dissect molecular vulnerabilities that can eliminate tumor subpopulations resistant to conventional therapies.",Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors,10101272,R01NS119650,"['Acetyltransferase', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Model', 'Caring', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'G0 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'HTATIP gene', 'Human', 'Indolent', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'conventional therapy', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'neoplasm resource', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurogenesis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'stem-like cell', 'temozolomide', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,553130
"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong. This work will help physicians time the administration of chemotherapy and will allow researchers to better understand how cancer physiology changes with time-of-day",Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy,10130460,R01CA227485,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptotic', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronotherapy', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Transport', 'Drug toxicity', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intestines', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phase', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Stomach', 'Streptozocin', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'clinically significant', 'dosage', 'experience', 'gene product', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'reconstruction', 'side effect', 'transcriptome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,599614
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,10116320,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,339613
"Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma Project Summary/Abstract Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is generally incurable with modest survival benefit provided by first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and post-platinum PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Optimal therapy for progressive mUC following PD1/L1 inhibitors is necessary with new agents for this setting (enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib) providing modest incremental benefits coupled with toxicities. Limited data exist for analysis of tumor acquired after PD1/L1 inhibitor systemic therapy, which is necessary to determine causes of both response and resistance. Indeed, multiplatform analyses of post-PD1/L1 inhibitor UC tumor have not been reported. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, immune and stromal microenvironmental factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of post-treatment tumors will reveal these features. We propose innovative and potentially transformative multiplatform longitudinally obtained bulk and/or single cell (sc) analysis of pre and post PD1/L1 inhibitor tumor tissue and plasma from muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and mUC to shed deep insights regarding tumor biology and resistance and information that can be used to develop new therapies. We will perform detailed multiplatform analyses on 2 separate cohorts totaling 170 patients: 1) tumor tissue obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=130) and 2) plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=40). Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq and orthogonal multiparametric IHC for immune markers is performed of baseline transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and post-therapy tumors. Patients included are from trials that evaluated a PD1/L1 inhibitor (n=70) as neoadjuvant therapy preceding RC for MIBC, or who received a PD1/L1 inhibitor for mUC (n=50) and control untreated and temporally separated serial FFPE tumors without intervening therapy (n=10). scRNAseq is performed on a subset of post-PD1/L1 mUC tumors (n=20) to analyze tumor, stromal and immune cells. WES is performed for immunogenomic analyses using quality-controlled plasma cfDNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy or control untreated patients (n=40). The functional relevance of specific genomic alterations and resultant predicted neoantigens is studied by examining functional immune and stromal readouts, which will shed insights regarding the immunogenicity of genomic alterations that can then provide the foundation for therapeutic advances. We will develop a novel integrated model using deep learning architecture to account for the stationary snapshot of the molecular tumor, stromal and immune profiles, and the time-based trajectory of clinical data to computationally aggregate heterogeneous data types. To summarize, this innovative study is expected to provide discoveries regarding determinants of UC progression following PD1/L1 inhibitors, an incurable disease setting with substantial unmet needs. Project Narrative Progressive metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant unmet needs. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, microenvironmental and immune cell genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 inhibitor therapy and metastasis in MIBC and mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of pre-treatment and post- treatment resistant tumors will reveal these features. This innovative study uses deep learning computational techniques to probe tumor biology of 170 patients to dissect the evolution of urothelial carcinoma resistance to PD1/L1 inhibitors and reveal potentially actionable therapeutic targets.",Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma,10218294,R21CA249875,"['Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Evolution', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genomics', 'Harvest', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Myomatous neoplasm', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'PDL1 inhibitors', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Platinum', 'Ploidies', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stromal Cells', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Toxic effect', 'Transitional Cell Carcinoma', 'Transurethral Resection', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'exome sequencing', 'heterogenous data', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macrophage', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoantigens', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'pembrolizumab', 'peripheral blood', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2021,476334
"Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective. However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic. We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays. Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies, however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus, our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude. Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states. Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary for an eventual impact on patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The treatment of pediatric cancers has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, however, these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. We will use new computational methodologies applied to large preclinical screening data from cancer cell lines and patient -omics datasets to investigate unmutated genes as potential drug targets in pediatric cancers (non-oncogene dependencies). We will perform the requisite downstream experimental work, including studying drug combinations and resistance mechanisms, necessary to motivate the clinical translation of our findings.",Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations,10184211,R01CA260060,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Childhood Solid Neoplasm', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Encyclopedias', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resource Sharing', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder subtype', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole genome']",NCI,ST.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920
"Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology. To this end, the proposal outlines a mentored-training program with a strong clinical emphasis to compliment the candidate's proficiency in medical and optical imaging, placing the candidate within a critical mass of NIH-funded researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The plan will focus on four complimentary areas: 1) providing a solid understanding of neurosurgical oncology, 2) developing an expertise in cancer molecular biology, 3) leading a pre-clinical investigation of molecular-guided cancer surgery, 4) expanding skills in optical engineering and machine learning, all of which will emphasize the synergy between understanding the clinical problems in neuro-oncology and advancing technology to address these problems. These goals are strongly supported by an experienced mentor team, led by neurosurgery section-chief Dr. Roberts, alongside NIH-funded researchers Profs. Paulsen, Pogue, and Hoopes. Leveraging the extensive opportunities at Dartmouth, the candidate will use K99 funding to devote time to graduate courses in cancer biology, medical imaging, and translational medicine, and to attend cancer workshops, training seminars, and CME-accredited Grand Rounds at the NCI Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The candidate will also attend AACR workshops to further strengthen clinical understanding of neuro-oncology, and provide a venue for presentation and feedback on the research work. The firm knowledge base gained by this training plan will be applied within the context of a pre-clinical research project to develop and evaluate a novel method of FGS- molecular-guided surgery (MGS) by means of intraoperative receptor concentration imaging (iRCI). The project will extend the rapidly growing field of FGS, applying a novel kinetic imaging approach to allow intraoperative evaluation of tumor-associated receptor expression, and to use this to guide surgical resection. Aim (1) will be to develop and test iRCI in a rat model of GBM, evaluating the accuracy of MGS to identify positive tissue and to improve EOTR compared with current FGS methods. Aim (2) will be to advance the current FGS camera systems, incorporating arterial input function measurement, and reducing absorption and scatter-based artifacts due to surface blood at the surgical site. Aim (3) will be to facilitate iRCI integrationinto the surgical workflow through strategic improvements in dye administration and AIF characterization. This proposal will expand the candidate's knowledge-base in cancer biology and surgical oncology, through extensive training opportunities and interactions with a strong multi-disciplinary team of mentors, equipping the candidate with all the necessary skills to accelerate the trajectory of his promising research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will provide the candidate an opportunity to broaden cancer biology and neurosurgical oncology skills through a comprehensive training program, to supplement already advanced skills in neuroimaging. Molecular guided surgery, an intraoperative technique designed to improve the extent of tumor resection by providing contrast between healthy and malignant tissue based on expression of tumor-specific receptors, will be developed and evaluated in a rat orthotopic model of human glioma.",Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors,10140127,R00CA190890,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dyes', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center', 'Nude Rats', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Permeability', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Shoes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sodium Fluorescein', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'U251', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer surgery', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'detection limit', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'human model', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'lens', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R00,2021,249000
"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,R01CA257612,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,619994
"Development of next generation 2HG and metabolic MR imaging for precision oncology of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients 7. Project Summary/Abstract Gliomas are rarely curable tumors with a low survival rate of 36% at five-years that is well below the average survival rate of 67.2% across all cancers, according to SEER and CBTRUS. Malignant brain tumors cause an average of 20 years of potential life lost (YPLL) for individuals diagnosed as adults, which exceeds most common cancers. Survival and YPLL have not improved for gliomas similarly to other cancers and progress is desperately needed. The lack of improvement in patient outcomes is not due to lack of new discoveries, but due to limited success in translating this knowledge into clinical benefit. Important discoveries have been made over the last decade regarding key molecular mechanisms involved in glioma initiation and growth, which have been incorporated in the latest WHO classification. IDH mutation is the primary event in glioma initiation and has become a paradigm shift in the treatment of glioma. Neuro-oncology experts (SNO, EANO) agree that brain imaging can accelerate clinical trials of targeted therapies and mandated the development of molecular imaging for highly specific and sensitive glioma imaging. The long-term goal of our research is the development of non-invasive molecular imaging methods that can be used clinically in cancer patients. IDH mutations are frequent in glioma and produce high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that can be imaged as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, guidance of surgery and radiation, response to chemotherapy and targeted treatments. The objective of this application is to develop fast high resolution whole brain quantitative 2HG and metabolic imaging for diagnosis, treatment guidance and monitoring of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that advancing next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging will enable precision oncology and accelerate clinical translation of novel targeted therapies to improve outcomes in mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients. Three specific aims will be performed for this: 1) develop fast high-resolution whole-brain clinically robust 2HG and metabolic imaging, 2) improve sensitivity, precision, accuracy and workflow of 2HG and metabolic imaging, and 3) clinical translation of next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging in glioma patients. There are strong rationales for the proposed research: 1) there is no alternative in vivo imaging method specific for IDH mutations, 2) 2HG imaging is completely non-invasive, can be repeated safe without any radiation, can provide results fast and cost effective, 3) provides comprehensive evaluation of the entire tumor and healthy brain without the sampling bias of biopsies, 4) it can be performed pre-surgically and in tumors that cannot be operated. The approach is innovative because it employs the first available whole brain 2HG imaging method, which will be accelerated by compressed sensing, novel shim hardware to improve data quality, and transformed in a high throughput automated tool by deep learning. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will provide clinicians with a user-friendly and precise tool for diagnostic, guiding and monitoring of glioma patients. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the capabilities of clinical MR scanners to image specific molecular signatures of primary brain tumors. The new features will provide rapid scanning, improved data quality, and automated data analytics for clinical use. This would enable precision oncology in patients with mutant IDH glioma tumors for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical translation of targeted therapies.

"Imaging Goggles for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases, resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource- limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike.  Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head- mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow. The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical software to improve user experience.  At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide. This objective approach to cancer surgery will reduce the incidence of PSMs and improve treatment outcomes. Narrative  Optical imaging instruments have permeated medical practice because of their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. We have developed a wearable head- mounted display device that is augmented by visible and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tissues in real- time. In collaboration with an industry partner, we will optimize the device performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering.

"FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1 assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response. Existing analysis of HNSCC cancer tissues obtained by core biopsy is limited in many aspects. We have developed a new immune and cancer cell profiling technology based on cellular immunocycling. Using fine needle aspirates (FNA) rather than more invasive core biopsies, this method allows frequent and serial profiling on the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC patients undergoing immunotherapy.",FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC,10154199,R01CA257623,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Diagnostic', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'companion diagnostics', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,670725
"Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR) effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on “active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects, hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and tumor-specific RT with less toxicity. Increasing the radiation dose delivered to rectal cancers treated preoperatively can improve pathological response at the time of surgery and possibly even obviate the need for surgery but this has been challenging to implement in the clinic due to the limited radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal intestinal loops. Gold nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors offer the possibility to increase radiation dose within the tumor without damaging adjacent normal tissues. To amplify this radiation dose enhancement, we propose to advance clinical translation of a paradigm using gold nanoparticles that home to the tumor, get internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, disperse in the cytoplasm via co-administered pharmacological agents, and can be modeled by mathematical techniques that predict the biological consequences of tumor accumulation.",Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic,10144062,R01CA257241,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nanotechnology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiosensitization', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'dosage', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'irradiation', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoGold', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'radiation response', 'receptor internalization', 'receptor mediated endocytosis', 'response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,631688
"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10219200,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,336645
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects. The results from this study will also provide mechanistic insight into the disease and guide future clinical trials to treat this tumor.",Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas,10231604,F30CA250122,"['Adenoviruses', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Astrocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neuraxis', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'efficacy testing', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncolysis', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'preclinical development', 'predicting response', 'protein protein interaction', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small hairpin RNA', 'standard of care', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'viral resistance']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,F30,2021,46236
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,10071162,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350595
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,10146311,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,579585
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,10114984,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,10180915,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2021,714132
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases. The main goal of this work is to build a model that recapitulates tumor-immune interactions in brain-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and use this model to identify novel druggable targets to improve survival outcomes in patients with devastating brain metastases.",Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases?,10115537,K99CA256522,"['Advisory Committees', 'African', 'African American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Infiltration', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer health disparity', 'career', 'career development', 'data integration', 'differential expression', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'survival outcome', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,162617
"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Project Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients, but have been largely ineffective for non-immunogenic cancers that lack intratumoral T cells. Most tumors have somatic mu- tations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor-speciﬁc and not expressed on normal cells (termed neoanti- gens). Cancers, such as melanoma, with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to respond to single agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), have lower mutational loads, resulting in fewer T cells inﬁltrating the tumor. Studies have previously demonstrated that an allogeneic GM-CSF- based vaccine enhances T cell inﬁltration into human pancreatic cancer. Recent work with Panc02 cells, which express around 60 neoantigens similar to human PDAC, showed that PancVAX, a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, when paired with immune modulators cleared tumors in Panc02-bearing mice. This data suggests that cancer vaccines targeting tumor neoantigens induce neoepitope-speciﬁc T cells, which can be further activated by ICIs, leading to tumor rejection. Currently the impact of such treatment on T cell expression states and the underly- ing mechanism of therapeutic response remains poorly deﬁned. Comprehensive characterization of responding T cells will be critical in understanding mechanisms of response and providing rationale for combinatorial therapy. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that when used alongside neoantigen-targeted vaccines, individual ICIs have distinct as well as synergistic modes of action and that different treatment combinations result in distinct changes in the T cell repertoire related to immunotherapy response. To address this hypothesis, I propose two speciﬁc aims. Aim 1: To characterize the transcriptional changes in T cells during immunotherapy treatment. I will ﬁrst investigate the effect of PancVAX, with and without addition of ICIs, on gene expression at a single-cell level in the Panc02 mouse model. Then I will determine biological processes driving differences in anti-tumor response between treatment arms. I will experimenally validate these differences using ﬂow cytometry. Aim 2: To develop trajectory building methods depicting the clonal evolution of T cells. We will apply this method to T cell receptor sequencing data from human clinical trials of PDAC treated with vaccine and ICI to identify key changes within the T cell repertoire associated with tumor regression or resistance. Successful completion of these aims will inform future combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC patients and provide new open-source computational software to characterize T cell populations that can be applied to diverse cancer types. The skills I will acquire as I complete this research will prepare me for a career as an interdisciplinary scientist, characterizing the tumor immune landscape to inform precision immunotherapy. Project Narrative Immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in pancreatic cancer. However, vaccines can convert these oth- erwise immunologically insensitive tumors into those that respond to agents called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This project aims to better understand the mechanism of response when vaccines against tumor-speciﬁc antigens are combined with ICIs.",T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,10139211,F31CA250135,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Vaccines', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'T cell clonality', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'base', 'cancer type', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'effector T cell', 'exhaustion', 'human data', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'open source', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'success', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,10070579,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,407754
"Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical implementation of Precision Medicine faces major challenges in precision disease stratification and staging, determining optimal treatment, monitoring therapy response, and overcoming drug resistance and relapse. To address these challenges, there is a critical unmet need for better biomarkers and tests that complement current methods for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to treatments. Liquid biopsy presents an innovative non-invasive modality for precision oncology as it promises to provide a global view of tumor dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are 40-150 nm membrane vesicles secreted by most cells and have been identified as essential mediators of cell interactions and signaling that promote tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Despite the potential clinical impact of these findings, precise biological functions of exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated modulation of tumor microenvironments, and their potential clinical value remain yet to be determined. This is due in part to the daunting challenges in isolation and analysis of these nanovesicles with diverse molecular and functional properties. Here we hypothesize that functional phenotypes of circulating exosomes can provide potent biomarkers for detecting early malignancy, monitoring tumor progression and metastasis, and assessing therapy response in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the advanced development and validation of a nano-engineered microfluidic biosensing system capable of integrative analysis of both molecular and functional phenotypes of exosomes in one streamlined workflow. The research will be performed by three specific aims: 1) Expand the MINDS strategy to develop an optimal 3D nano-engineered integrative EV molecular and activity profiling (EV-MAP) nanochip platform; 2) Adapt and optimize the EV-MAP technology for monitoring tumor burden and therapy response using mouse models; and 3) Evaluate and validate the EV-MAP technology for potential applications to clinical diagnosis and classification of breast cancer patients. The new technology will confer superior analytical capabilities to substantially accelerate the functional studies of circulating exosomes. Harnessing exosome activities for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic benefit presents a paradigm-shifting mechanism for precision medicine. While focused on breast cancer in this project, our research will ultimately create a transformative tool for studies of a wide range of bioactive exosomes in various malignancies to develop reliable non-invasive liquid biopsy of cancer.

"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,10116348,R03CA249554,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dropout', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney', 'Modeling', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrons', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal Mass', 'Research Project Grants', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Urologist', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2021,80500
"New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C) images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients. We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index. Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard volumetric metrics in current use. The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that confounds treatment management today. In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel multiparametric MRI biomarkers that precisely identify regions of brain tumor within areas of contrast-enhancement and peritumoral edema, which cannot be identified using standard MRI.

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,10067573,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,642578
"Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling ABSTRACT The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem, specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood- level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA- Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park, and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1) computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3) analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are highly diverse and patients with relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib induces response in 60% of patients with TCL through tumor cell-intrinsic and immunomodulatory mechanisms, but nearly all responders ultimately develop resistance. We hypothesize that the integration of spatial data, including neighborhood analyses to identify para- and juxtacrine interactions, with genetic and transcriptional alterations will inform predictive models for duvelisib response and nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance that can aid therapeutic selection and broadly applied across tumor types.",Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling,10115190,K99CA256497,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Immune', 'JAK1 gene', 'JAK2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular modeling', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'paracrine', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'spatial integration', 'spatial relationship', 'spectrograph', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,136080
"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer.

"Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to predict the responders, poses a serious challenge to advancing cancer care and research. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer.

"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC,10184419,R01DE030493,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dissection', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune signaling', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Domains', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tobacco use', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Markers', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'conventional therapy', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'genome wide screen', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenic', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment', 'tertiary lymphoid organ', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIDCR,H.

There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT). The three technologies encompass Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity, Deep learning and Intraoperative devices for image guided therapy which will be investigated both individually and in cross TR &D combinations. We will disseminate all technologies through a national network of collaborators, making these discoveries available to the larger medical community.",Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT),10090279,P41EB028741,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biomedical resource', 'brain surgery', 'cancer care', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'ion mobility', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolic imaging', 'microdevice', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prostate biopsy', 'protocol development', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'technology research and development', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool', 'trait', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P41,2021,1527478
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells. Outcomes from this project are expected to improve the efficacy and precision of cancer immunotherapies.",Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells,10248560,R01CA245318,"['Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Autologous', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD28 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cellular immunotherapy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HLA-A gene', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Human', 'IL2RA gene', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunodeficient Mouse', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Methods', 'Oncogenes', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor stage', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer treatment', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'complementarity-determining region 3', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gag Gene Products', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive marker', 'receptor', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'side effect', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,374864
"Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising in both men and women in the United States. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies are now FDA approved for advanced HCC, however, as few as 20% of patients receiving these agents will show an objective response to therapy. Because immune-related adverse events are non-trivial, predictive biomarkers that can explain the variability in immunotherapy response are needed to optimize patient selection.  Several lines of research have recently converged to associate oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway with tumor immune-evasion and poor clinical response to ICI therapy in HCC. In previous research, we found that HCC exhibiting high uptake of the positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging agent 18F- fluorocholine (FCH) often belonged to molecular tumor sub-types associated with beta-catenin activation and immune avoidance. Liquid biopsy based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has also made it possible to identify patients who have tumors that harbor mutations associated with increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.  This project comprises a phase 2 biomarker clinical trial to prospectively evaluate these specific embodiments of PET/CT and liquid biopsy as tools for detecting HCC recalcitrant to ICI therapy on the basis of beta-catenin activation. In addition to characterizing and comparing the predictive capabilities of FCH PET/CT and cfDNA mutation profiling based on phase 2 clinical endpoints, this project will utilize decision tree based machine learning to estimate the predictive performance of an integrative imaging-genomic biomarker while also further examining how tumor mutations are related to PET metabolic phenotype and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, because tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is incongruent with FCH uptake in HCC, a third aim will utilize the trial as a molecular screening process to create an enriched sub-cohort of patients with FDG-avid tumors. These patients will undergo serial FDG PET/CT to evaluate FDG as a source of predictive biomarkers of ICI response for an orthogonal molecular sub-type of HCC. If these diagnostic tests are found reliable at predicting tumor resistance/response, they could significantly enhance the clinical precision and overall benefit of immunotherapy for HCC and possibly other cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  While immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are a major advance in cancer treatment, only a minority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of primary liver cancer) will benefit from this form of immunotherapy. This project comprises a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and DNA sequencing based liquid biopsy as diagnostic tools for predicting resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is to determine whether using these tests can potentially increase a patient’s chance of receiving a drug that will help them.",Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma,10277385,R01CA262460,"['Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Markers', 'United States', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'antibody inhibitor', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging agent', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune-related adverse events', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'melanoma', 'men', 'metabolic phenotype', 'migration', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'objective response rate', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,520008
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,10251015,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,604374
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape. From these measures, we will create methods that will enable clinical trials and physicians to make informed decisions about the treatment’s success and whether the child will recover their vision.",Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response,10197029,UG3CA236536,"['3-Dimensional', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complete Blindness', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Glioma', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Volume', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer predisposition', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG3,2021,446107
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,10071871,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'efficacy evaluation', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,10137898,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,311975
"Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma. PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop a pathomics biosignature for aggressive melanoma to guide treatment decisions for patients who have had a melanoma surgically removed but remain at high risk of recurrence and death. This is a critical need because patients with stage II and III melanoma have an approximate 30% chance of dying of melanoma over 10 years. Therapies have been shown to lessen recurrence risk, but they are toxic and costly. Identifying patients who have truly been cured by the surgery and are cancer free would be tremendously useful to guide patient care. It has been known for decades that the immune system limits melanoma progression and that higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) portend a favorable outcome. Assessment of TILs, however, involves a subjective determination by the pathologist using qualitative criteria and this approach is prone to inter-observer variability. One barrier to the development of prognostic biomarkers in early stage melanoma is that the tumors are tiny and most dermato-pathologists require that the entire sample be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) for careful morphology analysis. In order to overcome this barrier, our team has developed and published three digital pathology methods to estimate recurrence risk. These biomarkers are based on the hypothesis that evidence of strong immune surveillance within the tissue indicates lower recurrence risk and include quantitation of TILs using digital software, staining for macrophages and T cells using quantitative- immune-fluorescence (qIF), and measurement of an interferon signature using NanoString technology. Each of these methods provides unique information about the tumor immune micro-environment. For example, NanoString provides genomic information but does not provide spatial information regarding the locations of specific cell phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as qIF does. For instance, qIF revealed the macrophages confer a poor prognosis specifically when located within the tumor stroma. In Aim 1 of the proposal we validate three previously published biomarkers using 514 melanoma samples from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, The University of British Columbia, Yale School of Medicine, and Geisinger Health Systems. Next, in Aim 2 of the proposal we propose an integrative systems biology approach including transcriptomic, qIF, morphology analysis of TILS, and standard clinical and pathology features to create a multi-parameter biosignature. First, we use the raw clinical and pathomics data to build a model multiscale biomarker network of aggressive skin melanoma. Using a Bayesian network, we identify nodes that determine the recurrence phenotype and identify new imaging and genomic targets that may enhance the precision of our biomarker. We then construct a composite biosignature based on this network. Finally, we test the new biosignature, as well as the original multiply validated biomarkers from Aim 1 in prospective retrospective fashion on samples from the E1697 trial of adjuvant interferon for which there is over 10 years of follow up. The retrospective prospective approach removes any selection bias introduced by retrospective study. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to identify patients with stage II-III melanoma who have been cured by surgery, are not likely to recur, and should not receive further treatment. The immune system limits cancer progression but to date no biomarkers are available to define low risk groups. We further validate previously developed immune biomarkers and combine them to create a composite biosignature defining patients who can safely be spared the expense and toxicity of therapy.",Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma.,10214049,R01CA260375,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'British Columbia', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Skin', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Update', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nano-string', 'network models', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,693456
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue. Patient care and clinical decision-making will improve dramatically as a complete picture of histological features underlying brain tumor imaging emerges from this proposal.",Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology,10173711,R01CA218144,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contrast Media', 'Cytology', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress Tests', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor imaging', 'cancer cell', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision-making', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2021,352275
